President Volodymyr Zelensky has said everyone who commits atrocities against Ukraine's civilians will be punished.
He said Ukrainians would not forgive or forget, and accused invading Russian troops of deliberate murder.
""There will be no quiet place on Earth for you. Except for the grave,"" the president said.
Ukrainian officials say Russia is striking civilian targets around the country, including hospitals, nurseries, and schools.
But Russia denies targeting civilians, saying it is carrying out a ""special military operation"" against Ukrainian ""nationalists"" and ""neo-Nazis"".
Ukraine's Deputy Prime Minister Olha Stefanishyna told the BBC that, after ""strong resistance"" from the Ukrainian army, there was an ""enormous operation"" by Russia against civilians.
On Sunday alone, a family of four were killed when Russian forces fired shells at people fleeing the conflict in the town of Irpin, north-west of Kyiv.
And in the port city of Mariupol, promised evacuations were cancelled on both Saturday and Sunday amid fresh attacks.
The city council there said Russian shelling had made safe movement impossible. Russia has blamed Ukrainian forces.
The city is now in its sixth day with no running water, no power, and no sanitation. Food and water are fast running out.
Moscow announced it would open new evacuation corridors at 09:00 local time (07:00 GMT) in Mariupol and other cities. However, the routes published by Russia's RIA Novosti news agency show some of the corridors end in Russia and Belarus.
The corridor from Kyiv will lead to Russian ally Belarus, and civilians from Kharkiv will only have a corridor leading to Russia.
Corridors from the cities of Mariupol and Sumy will lead both to other Ukrainian cities and to Russia, the AFP news agency reports.
Ms Stefanishyna spoke to the BBC from a sandbagged room on Sunday morning
In a video address to mark the Orthodox Church's Forgiveness Sunday, Mr Zelensky said that instead of forgiveness there would be a day of judgment.
""We will not forgive, we will not forget, we will punish everyone who committed atrocities in this war on our land,"" he said. 
He said Russia had announced shelling of defence targets which were built in cities in Soviet times.
""Thousands of people work there. Hundreds of thousands live nearby. This is murder. Premeditated murder,"" he said.
He also condemned Western governments for failing to speak out against the plan.
The World Health Organization said health facilities were being attacked, with its director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus saying they had caused ""multiple deaths and injuries""., external
The British government has accused Russia of targeting populated areas ""in multiple locations"", noting in an intelligence update, external that it had ""previously used similar tactics in Chechnya in 1999 and Syria in 2016"". 
On Sunday, UN monitors said 364 civilian deaths had been confirmed in Ukraine since the invasion began on 24 February, but the real figure was likely to be ""considerably higher"". 
The UNHCR said more than 1.5 million people had fled Ukraine since Russia invaded.
Ukraine's Deputy Prime Minister Olha Stefanishyna - who was speaking to BBC TV's Sunday Morning programme - accused Russia of ""military tactics right in the cities of Ukraine"", adding they were carrying out a ""terroristic plan"", with attacks coming from the air and also by land.
""Shelled hospitals, the shelled houses for kindergartens and schools, and the ordinary households,"" she said. ""This is how the reality looks.""
She said Ukraine was seeing ""another wave of implementation of this terroristic plan of [the] Russian Federation"".
Ms Stefanishyna claimed Russia was suffering ""enormous losses"" of soldiers and equipment, but this ""does not deter Russia"". 
""It only encourages further aggression,"" she said.

2,2,Ukraine war 'catastrophic for global food',"Mon, 07 Mar 2022 00:14:42 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-60623941,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-60623941?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,One of the world's biggest fertiliser firms says the conflict could deliver a shock to food supplies.,"Ukraine war 'catastrophic for global food'
The war in Ukraine will deliver a shock to the global supply and cost of food, the boss of one of the world's biggest fertiliser companies has said.
Yara International, which operates in more than 60 countries, buys considerable amounts of essential raw materials from Russia. 
Fertiliser prices were already high due to soaring wholesale gas prices.
Yara's boss, Svein Tore Holsether, has warned the situation could get even tougher. 
""Things are changing by the hour,"" he told the BBC. 
""We were already in a difficult situation before the war... and now it's additional disruption to the supply chains and we're getting close to the most important part of this season for the Northern hemisphere, where a lot of fertiliser needs to move on and that will quite likely be impacted.""
Russia and Ukraine are some of the biggest producers in agriculture and food globally.
Russia also produces enormous amounts of nutrients, like potash and phosphate - key ingredients in fertilisers, which enable plants and crops to grow.  
""Half the world's population gets food as a result of fertilisers... and if that's removed from the field for some crops, [the yield] will drop by 50%,"" Mr Holsether said.
""For me, it's not whether we are moving into a global food crisis - it's how large the crisis will be.""
Svein Tore Holsether said fertiliser prices were already high due to soaring gas prices
His company has already been affected by the conflict after a missile hit Yara's office in Kyiv. The 11 staff were unharmed.  
The Norwegian-based company isn't directly affected by sanctions against Russia, but is having to deal with the fall-out. Trying to secure deliveries has become more difficult due to disruption in the shipping industry.
Just hours after Mr Holsether spoke to the BBC, the Russian government urged its producers to halt fertiliser exports. 
He pointed out that about a quarter of the key nutrients used in European food production come from Russia.
""At the same time we're doing whatever we can do at the moment to also find additional sources. But with such short timelines it's limited,"" he said before the news emerged.
Analysts have also warned that the move would mean higher costs for farmers and lower crop yields. That could feed through into even higher costs for food.

Five ways the Ukraine war could push up prices
Energy shock: The economic reality of Putin's war
Nutrients aren't the only factor to consider, either.
Huge amounts of natural gas are needed to produce ammonia, the key ingredient in nitrogen fertiliser. Yara International relies on vast quantities of Russian gas for its European plants.  
Last year, it was forced to temporarily suspend production of about 40% of its capacity in Europe because of the spike in the price of wholesale gas. Other producers also cut supplies. 
Combined with higher shipping rates, sanctions on Belarus (another major potash supplier) and extreme weather - this prompted a big jump in fertiliser prices last year, adding to a surge in food prices. 
The company says it's making day-to-day evaluations on how to maintain supply and that it is too early to say if more shutdowns may be on the cards.
It acknowledges it has a ""very strong obligation"" to keep production running at what it describes as a critical point.
But Yara's boss says the world must, in the long-term, reduce its dependency on Russia for global food production.
""On the one hand, we're trying to keep fertiliser flowing to the farmers to keep up the agricultural yields. 
""At the same time... there has to be a strong reaction. We condemn the Russian military invasion of Ukraine so this is a dilemma and one that frankly is very difficult.""
Climate change and growing populations had already been adding to the challenges the global food production system faces - all before the pandemic started.
The Yara International chief executive describes the war as ""a catastrophe on top of a catastrophe"", highlighting just how vulnerable to shocks the global food supply chain now is. 
It will increase food insecurity in poorer countries, he adds.
""We have to keep in mind that in the last two years, there's been an increase of 100 million more people that go to bed hungry... so for this to come on top of it is really worrying.""

3,3,Manchester Arena bombing: Saffie Roussos's parents on hearing the truth,"Mon, 07 Mar 2022 00:05:40 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-60579079,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-60579079?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,The parents of the Manchester Arena bombing's youngest victim speak about their life since she died.,"Manchester Arena bombing: Saffie Roussos's parents on hearing the truth
Saffie Roussos
Last month, the inquiry into the bombing of an Ariana Grande concert at Manchester Arena heard its final scheduled evidence. The BBC's Judith Moritz has followed the family of Saffie-Rose Roussos - the youngest of the 22 victims - as they have uncovered details of their daughter's death while learning to live with their grief.
Saffie Roussos' bedroom looks just how you would expect an eight-year-old's room to look. Her name plate is on the door. Her vibrant My Little Pony dressing gown hangs on a peg. Her tiny pink Converse boots sit on a chair. And at the centre of it, her white bed is festooned with scatter cushions, fairy lights and pom poms. 
Her artwork adorns the walls. A painting which reads, ""I love mummy so much"" and a drawing of the whole family, with ""me, Saffie"", written in felt tip.
But Saffie has never visited this room. And although the bed is beautifully made up, she'll never sleep in it. Saffie's childhood stopped abruptly when she was murdered in the 2017 Manchester Arena bombing. 
Saffie's drawing of her family
Before she was killed, Saffie lived with her parents Lisa and Andrew, and brother Xander, in their flat above the family fish and chip shop in Leyland, Lancashire. But when the bomb went off, their lives were changed in a fraction of a second.
After the explosion they never returned home. They never opened up the chippy again. Lisa went through months of hospital treatment, and when it was over the family went on holiday to Dorset. And they decided to stay there for good.
""We just basically escaped. I suppose a bit like running away,"" says Andrew Roussos.  
Saffie's things were packed up, and for a long time her parents found it too painful to go through them. Their move south gave them space, and put distance between them and the intensity of Manchester. There, the civic ""bee"" emblem had taken on a new dimension, spread across the city on posters, walls and tattoos. Lisa found it both supportive and stifling. 
She says: ""In the north, where it happened, they still talk about it now. They still think about the families and everybody, and that's beautiful and I wanted that. But at the same time, with us moving here, you can pick and choose when to look at it, when to face it. It's quiet, you've got the sea, the countryside. I think it was the best decision.""
Lisa admits she had been torn. She initially did not want to move as she felt she was moving away from Saffie, wanting to be where she had lived. 
Saffie Roussos
It was a while before she realised that it would be possible to relocate, and still feel close to her little girl. ""Saffie will always be with us,"" she says simply.
Lisa and Andrew started house-hunting. They needed a two-bedroom house, for themselves and Xander, but they decided to search for a three-bed. Saffie would have her own room again as her parents decided it was time to unpack her belongings, and create a new room for her. 
Lisa explains they did not want to put her things away into cupboards or the loft, wanting instead to move forward with Saffie. 
""We've changed the knobs on her wardrobe. Even though we wanted to keep her furniture, I've updated it a little bit because I know she would like new things.  
Lisa and Andrew Roussos
The Roussos family is an intensely private unit. They take comfort in each other, and have largely eschewed public attention. But they have always wanted the world to know how special Saffie was to them. That is what led them to invite me to their home as part of the process of making our film about Saffie for Panorama.
I first met Andrew just weeks after the bombing, when Lisa was still in hospital and the family was reeling from the attack. He told me then that Saffie had always wanted to be famous for singing and dancing like her idol Ariana Grande. 
He could never have imagined that her name would be connected with the singer's for the most tragic reasons. He said he was determined to reclaim the joy that had surrounded his daughter during her short life. That meant telling as wide an audience as possible about the wonder of his little girl and the happiness she brought.
Saffie's Ariana Grande posters
We filmed an interview and I told Andrew to keep in touch. I also asked him if Lisa was likely to want to say anything publicly when the time was right. There was significant media interest in their story, and I wondered if she would be as keen to speak about Saffie as her husband.
A few weeks later, Andrew suggested that I visit the couple at Wythenshawe hospital in Manchester. Lisa had been so badly hurt in the attack that she was initially only given a 20% chance of survival. By the summer of 2017, they were living as a family in hospital accommodation while her treatment continued.
When I met Lisa, it was clear that the time was not right for her to do an interview. She was having to cope with her own rehabilitation while coming to terms with the news that her youngest child had not survived the atrocity. I had been invited to meet her as a journalist, but I am also a mum, and my heart went out to her on a personal level. I had been to the arena with my own children a few weeks before the bombing, I knew that it could have been me in Lisa's shoes. I struggled to find the right words to express my sympathy. 
It took another two years before Lisa decided that she wanted to talk publicly about what she was going through, and another two before she reached the point of inviting me to see her daughter's room in Dorset. She said she wanted to show me something special.

There, we sat on Saffie's bed - she felt it was finally time to look through her daughter's baby box of keepsakes, something that she had found too painful after the attack, worried about the emotions it would unleash.
Saffie's bedroom
In fact, Lisa beams as she shows me the scan pictures, talking about the pregnancy and how Saffie would not stop moving, a real livewire as she had been throughout her life. Each treasure - her first lock of hair, her newborn ID bracelet - unlocks a memory and she basks in them.
She picks out a pair of miniature flip flops. ""I bought them in Kefalonia. I remember pushing her in her pram with them on and they kept falling off.""
The tears come, but they are mixed with laughter as Lisa remembers the happy moments. She and Andrew have spoken to me several times about the pattern grief has taken for them. They describe it as a constant never-ending presence that has evolved into something they are learning to live with. 
At the same time, they have also reached the stage of wanting to find out more about what happened to Saffie. For a long time, they did not want to know a great level of detail. But as the public inquiry into the attack started in September 2020, their legal team prepared them for hard times ahead. 
The couple had always believed that their daughter died within seconds of the bomb exploding, and that she had not suffered. But at the inquiry they learned that Saffie had lived for an hour, and that she had died as a result of blood loss from leg injuries. Her legs were never given tourniquets or splinted. Two sets of experts at the public inquiry are in dispute over whether she might have survived if she had received better emergency care.
Andrew says: ""It was our biggest fear. Our minds were set to, 'right, a bomb detonated, she lost her life, and it went quickly'. So that's what we chose to carry on life with. Finding out exactly what happened is hard to take… It's torture on top of torture.""
The couple have been represented at the public inquiry by Pete Weatherby QC, who explains: ""Saffie was able to talk, able to drink water. In the ambulance something like 40 minutes after detonation she asked the ambulance staff if she was going to die. Therefore, the issue of whether there were further interventions that might have made a difference to Saffie became apparent.""
Saffie Roussos
The Roussos family solicitor, Nicola Brook, had to tell the couple Saffie had lived for a while, with an unknown degree of possibility about whether she could have survived. She then had to ask whether they wanted to explore that further.
""That is, without a shadow of a doubt, the hardest conversation I've ever had to have,"" she says.
Lisa and Andrew agreed they were ready to look into the intricacies of Saffie's case. But they have had very different approaches to the Manchester Arena Inquiry, which has been running for 18 months. 
Andrew has followed nearly every day of the hearings by remote video link. Lisa has found them too distressing to listen to, and relies on Andrew to outline the main issues for her.
But when it came to giving evidence, ​both were determined to go into the witness box in person, and so they steeled themselves to make the trip from Dorset back up to Manchester. I joined them again that morning, as they packed their car for the trip, which Lisa confessed she had been dreading. 
Ex-officer accepts bomber intelligence oversight
Ten key moments from the Manchester Arena Inquiry
Reduced training 'a deliberate choice' before bomb
She said it had been causing her sleepless nights and she would not do it if she didn't have to. ""I know it's going to be emotionally draining. But I just thought, 'Lisa, you've got to do it. You've got to do it for Saffie. She hasn't got that voice, so we have to give it to her.'""
At court, the couple told the inquiry about their experiences on the night of the attack. How Lisa lay on the floor of the arena foyer unable to move. And how Andrew spent all night searching for her and Saffie. He and Xander travelled to three hospitals, and only discovered that Saffie had died the following afternoon.
Andrew Roussos with his son outside the Manchester Arena following the bomb attack
The public inquiry has given him an opportunity to dig deep into what happened. He says, ""What drives me, I suppose, is knowing the information. So I'm there representing us as a family and Saffie as our daughter. Even though the legal team are there to do that, I want to know. I want to scrutinise everybody to the point of getting to the truth.""
Grieving for a child can destroy a marriage. But Lisa and Andrew each say they could not have managed without the other. Their characters complement each other. Andrew is passionate and talkative. Lisa is a calming presence.
The experience of speaking in court was draining for them both. Afterwards they were clearly exhausted, but relieved. Lisa said she was glad she had taken part as it was her one chance to say what she needed to say. ""The build-up to it was awful but I do feel better now that I've done it,"" she says.
But the couple are clear that the inquiry has to make a real difference. 
Andrew says he is angry lessons still need to be learned: ""My argument is why didn't you learn from 7/7? Why didn't you learn from 9/11? Why didn't you learn from the Paris attacks in 2016? This wasn't the first terrorist attack.""
Manchester Arena Inquiry: Bomb response shameful, says victim's dad
He adds: ""I just hope the whole process of this inquiry does what it set out to do. What it's meant to do. We're never going to stop this… but at least at the next attack we'll be more prepared.""
Their time at court was not the only intense moment of the family's trip to Manchester. 
Saffie's mobile phone
Saffie used to love playing with her mobile phone. She had taken endless selfies with it. Naturally, she took it with her on the night of the Ariana Grande concert. But it shattered in the blast and when it was returned to her parents, it seemed beyond repair. 
Lisa and Andrew told me they had tried everything to make it work again. They badly wanted to look at the photos on it, to have a last glimpse of Saffie's world. I asked them if they would trust me to take the phone away for forensic work.
In truth, I was not sure if I would be able to get any results, so I was thrilled when I was able to tell them that despite such extensive damage, I was able to have the phone reconstructed - and there were photos to look at.
The pictures were Saffie's last selfies. She took them in the car with Lisa on their way to the concert. The little girl is wearing her Ariana Grande T-shirt, and beaming, on what should have been one of the happiest days of her life.
Selfie of Saffie and Lisa
Tearfully, Lisa remembered them being taken. She said, ""Me and Saffie were in the back of the car on the way to the arena. It's just so so sad… I wish I'd taken more pictures of me and her. You take them for granted because you don't think of the worst, ever. Why would you? But afterwards you realise how precious and important they are.""
Although it is upsetting to see the selfies, Lisa and Andrew say they will always treasure them. They are determined that Saffie will always be a part of their lives. I ask Lisa about the concept of ""closure"" which is sometimes spoken about.
She says, ""Who wants closure? It's the opposite. You can't have closure. You don't want closure. You want to take that memory with you forever. We want to take her with us forever. I want to talk about her. I want to remember her. I want everyone to remember her.""

Petrol prices have hit another record high as oil and gas costs soar amid fears of a global economic shock from Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
Oil jumped to $139 a barrel at one point, the highest level for almost 14 years, while wholesale gas prices for next-day delivery more than doubled.
It came as the US hinted at a ban on buying Russian energy, as it looked to other countries to increase supplies.
However, European leaders rejected that idea on Monday. 
German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said Europe had ""deliberately exempted"" Russian energy from sanctions because its supply cannot be secured ""any other way"" at the moment. 
And Netherlands prime minister Mark Rutte said: ""The painful reality is we are still very much dependent on Russian gas and Russian oil and if you now force European companies to quit doing business with Russia that would have enormous ramifications around Europe including Ukraine but also around the world.
""We have to reduce our dependency. That will take time,"" he added. 
Market turmoil
UK petrol prices have hit an average of 155p a litre, the AA motoring group said.
The market turmoil is fuelling concerns that the price of many everyday items from food to petrol and heating, already rising at their fastest rate for 30 years, could be pushed higher.
Analysts have already warned that UK energy bills could reach as high as £3,000 a year due to the surge in oil and gas prices. 
Russia is the world's second top producer of crude oil after Saudi Arabia, and supplies about a third of Europe's needs. The price of Brent crude rose by more than a fifth last week amid fears of a reduction in Russian supplies.
After peaking at $139.13 a barrel early on Monday, the price of Brent crude - an international benchmark - fell back to around $125.

The latest rise in UK petrol prices has pushed the cost to more than £7 a gallon, the AA said. Filling up a car with a 55-litre tank now costs nearly £17 more than a year ago, rising from £68.60 to £85.59.
The boss of fuel delivery firm Portland Fuel, James Spencer, told the BBC he thought fuel prices could reach £1.70-£1.75 a litre. ""Even if we can get extra [oil] supplies on to the market, nothing will happen quickly."" 
He said that, to a certain extent, individual car drivers have options to cut their use by driving less, but added that businesses that have no alternatives were really starting to feel the squeeze.
The crisis continues to affect share markets. The main stock exchanges in France and Germany sank more than 4% in early trading before paring their losses, closing 1.3% and 2% lower respectively. 
In London, the FTSE 100 dropped more than 2%, but then recovered to close 0.4% lower. Last week, the FTSE had its worse week since the start of the pandemic in March 2020.
In the US, markets ended lower with the Dow Jones and S&P 500 down 2.4% and 3% respectively. The Dow is now in a ""correction"", having fallen 10% since its last record closing level on 4 January.
The price of gold, a haven in troubled times for investors looking for security, hit $2,000 an ounce for the first time in almost 18 months.
These are massive movements in the price of commodities - the raw materials that eventually feed, warm and transport us.
The extra movements this morning arose out of talk of an embargo on Russian oil. That is very significant, because Russia is the second biggest world exporter. Anyone passing a petrol station would have seen the impact. If there was an actual embargo, the price of an average tank could head close to £100, and indeed is already there at the most expensive service stations in the UK.
But we don't need to be physically reliant on actual Russian supplies for it to feed through into the prices our suppliers pay and then pass on to us. The price for gas in international markets was already at incredible highs last week. It further increased by a third to frankly frightening levels, 10- to 15-times normal, above £6 per therm. 
If in the first half of this year these prices average £3.20, then typical dual fuel bills in October could rise to £3,000 a year or £250 a month.
On Sunday, the US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the Biden administration and its allies were discussing a ban on Russian oil supplies.
The comments came as pressure grows on the White House and other Western nations to take tougher action against Moscow over its invasion of Ukraine.
A Russian oil embargo would be a major escalation in the response to the invasion of Ukraine and would potentially have a major impact on the global economy. 
However, some European countries are reluctant given their dependence on Russian energy supplies. 
""While the US might just push through a ban on Russian oil imports, Europe can ill-afford to do the same. More worryingly, [Russian leader Vladimir] Putin, with his back to the wall, could turn off gas supplies to Europe, cutting off the continent's energy lifeline,"" said Vandana Hari at oil markets analysis firm Vanda Insights.
Mr Johnson said Europe could not simply shut down the use of oil and gas overnight, but that countries should move together quickly to look beyond Russia for its oil and gas supplies.
On Sunday, energy giant Shell defended its decision to purchase Russian crude oil despite the invasion of Ukraine.
The company said it was forced to buy oil from Russia in order to maintain timely supplies of fuel to Europe.
""To be clear, without an uninterrupted supply of crude oil to refineries, the energy industry cannot assure continued provision of essential products to people across Europe over the weeks ahead,"" a spokesperson added.
A possible ban on buying Russian oil has intensified pressure to find alternative supplies. 
The US is this week expected to press Saudi Arabia to increase crude production, and there is fresh impetus for a deal over Iran's nuclear ambitions that would lift sanctions on its oil exports.
However, progress on a deal has been hampered after Russia sought a US guarantee that the sanctions it faces over the Ukraine conflict will not affect its trade with Tehran.

Boris Johnson says no European country had done more than the UK to settle vulnerable people since 2015
Prime Minister Boris Johnson has called for a ""step-by-step"" move away from dependence on Russian oil and gas as a result of the Ukraine war.
After talks with the Canadian and Dutch PMs, Mr Johnson said nations have to work together to secure alternatives.
Canada's PM Justin Trudeau said Europe did not want to repeat its mistake of being too dependent on Russia.
But Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte warned forcing a boycott now would have ""enormous consequences"".
And in Germany, Chancellor Olaf Scholz cautioned against banning Russian oil and gas.
In a statement, he said Europe had ""deliberately exempted"" Russian energy from sanctions because its supply cannot be secured ""any other way"" at the moment.

Meanwhile, Russia warned that oil prices could surge to $300 a barrel and it might close the main gas pipeline to Germany if the West halted oil imports over the invasion of Ukraine. 
""Foregoing Russian oil will have catastrophic consequences for the world market,"" said Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak.
Mr Johnson's call came at a Downing Street news conference after he, Mr Trudeau, and Mr Rutte discussed new sanctions against Russia and aid for Ukraine.
Asked about claims that the US was in active discussions with European nations about banning imports of Russian oil, Mr Johnson said Western allies are ""moving very, very fast"" - and things which weeks ago would not have been considered are ""now very much on the table"".
He said he would set out a new energy supply strategy in the coming days, saying the UK was looking at using more of its own fossil fuels. 
But he said the UK was not abandoning its commitment to cut carbon emissions.
The UK gets less than 5% of its gas from Russia - but for EU countries the figure is about 40%.
Mr Rutte told the news conference the change would have to be ""diligent and not overnight"", combined with a faster uptake of renewable energy.
An immediate change would ""basically undermine supply chains the world over, particularly in Europe,"" he said, adding: ""It would also have an impact on Ukraine itself.""
Mr Johnson also announced a further £175m of UK support for Ukraine and Mr Trudeau said Canada would sanction 10 more Russian oligarchs and officials.
Later the prime minister joined a call with Mr Scholz, US President Joe Biden and French President Emmanuel Macron, where they said they were determined to continue raising the cost on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine.
Mr Johnson said previously unthinkable options for Western leaders were now ""very much on the table""
Western nations are facing calls to do more as Russia continues its bombardment of Ukrainian cities. 
The UK has also been criticised after it emerged that only about 50 refugees have been granted visas to enter the country as of Sunday.
During a visit to an RAF station with his fellow leaders, Mr Johnson said the UK was ""processing thousands"" and would be ""very generous"" to refugees, but would not let people in without any checks.
What sanctions are being imposed on Russia?
Will new legal powers find Putin's loot?
The government has so far announced two main schemes for people fleeing Ukraine to come to the UK - one which allows family members of people settled in the UK to join them and the other which allows organisations to sponsor a Ukrainian's entry.
Home Office sources have said they are in the early stages of exploring a scheme to provide humanitarian access to people fleeing the conflict.
But a senior government source told the BBC the focus was still on the two schemes for Ukrainian refugees that have already been announced, and the need for further action was being kept under review.
Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the Home Office was in a ""complete mess"" and the government must establish a ""simple route to sanctuary"", while Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the UK was ""not doing anywhere near enough"" to help refugees.
More than 1.5 million people have fled Ukraine since the invasion began, according to the UN refugee agency.

Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer says the Home Office is in a ""complete mess"" over how Ukrainians can get to the UK
Meanwhile, MPs are expected to vote later on the Economic Crime Bill, which aims to make it easier to sanction individuals.
In recent days, the government has announced asset freezes and travel bans on a number of oligarchs - but has faced accusations of being too slow to sanction those with links to President Putin.

The bill will set up a new register that will mean foreign owners of UK property must declare and verify their identities with Companies House. 
MPs are expected to vote through all stages of the bill in a single sitting. 
Labour said it would support the legislation, but wanted the proposed timeframe for property owners to register to be cut from six months to 28 days.

Most refugees are crossing the border into Poland, like this girl who travelled from Lviv
Fifty Ukrainians have been granted visas under a scheme for refugees with family links to the UK, the Home Office has announced.
It is about 1% of the 5,535 people who have applied since the programme launched 48 hours earlier.
Europe minister James Cleverly said he did not know the exact figures but said numbers would increase ""very quickly"".
The Ukrainian ambassador praised the UK effort but urged for the ""maximum"" number of people to be admitted.
Home Secretary Priti Patel said she was ""doing everything possible"" to speed up efforts to issue the travel permits.
The UK has steadily increased its visa offer to refugees from the Ukraine war, extending it to parents, grandparents and siblings as well as ""immediate family"" and extending the visas to three years.
But it has faced criticism that its scheme is less generous than the European Union's, while France accused the UK of a ""lack of humanity"", saying that 150 refugees were turned back at Calais for lacking a visa.

Ukraine refugees can stay in UK for three years
Earlier this week, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said 200,000 Ukrainians would be eligible to travel to the UK as he extended the offer of visas to a wider range of family members. 
As of 10:00 GMT on Sunday, the Home Office said 11,750 had begun applications online, while 5,535 had completed them.
It added that 2,368 had booked a visa appointment to submit their application and biometric information, while ""around 50"" visas had been granted.
Mr Cleverly told BBC Breakfast the final figure would be ""significantly"" more than the 50 figure being quoted and said while a process was needed the government would make it ""as quick, easy and as fast as possible"".
""We are looking to create something very, very large-scale very, very quickly"" he said. ""Initially it will be slower than we would like but that will pick up."" 
Asked if it was acceptable that about 1% of applications had been granted in the first 48 hours of the scheme, Ms Patel said it was ""the first scheme in the world that's up and running in this short period of time"".
""This is an incredible scheme and we are doing everything possible, surging capacity across every single application centre across the EU,"" she said, adding that staff were being flown into Ukraine's border countries to speed up applications.
Ukraine's immediate neighbours have taken in the majority of the 1.5 million people estimated to have fled the war, with more than one million arriving in Poland.
Mr Celverly said that while ""all of us would want to throw our arms open and be generous"" there needed to be a process but there was no upper limit on how many Ukrainians could come to the UK via government schemes.
""We want to play our part but of course most Ukrainian refugees are in the countries bordering Ukraine and that's where they want to stay and we are providing humanitarian support for them there as well,"" he said.
'Not turning people back'
France's Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin wrote to Ms Patel on Saturday, saying that 400 Ukrainian refugees had arrived at Calais to cross the Channel, but 150 were sent back and told to obtain UK visas at embassies in Paris or Brussels.
Mr Darmanin said the response to people in distress was ""completely unsuitable"" and showed a ""lack of humanity"", calling for the UK to put consular staff at Calais to help Ukrainian refugees cross.
But Ms Patel said it was ""wrong to say we are turning people back"" and said the Home Office already had people working in Calais to support Ukrainian families.
The Sun reported, external that Ms Patel was ""investigating legal options"" to create a humanitarian route, which would mean anyone without ties to the UK fleeing the conflict would have the right to come to the UK.
However, the BBC understands this referred to the already announced route where refugees can be sponsored by individuals, communities or organisation and Mr Cleverly confirmed that there had been no change to the government's policy over the weekend.
Vadym Prystaiko, Ukraine's ambassador to the UK, said that the visa process could be simplified, adding that any issues could be resolved later but right now the ""maximum"" number needed to be admitted.
He said any ""bureaucratic nonsense"" should be cleared away, although he said it was necessary to continue security checks.
But he said the UK was at the ""forefront of the effort"" to support Ukraine.
On Monday the Disasters Emergency Committee announced its Ukraine appeal had raised more than £100m in four days, external.

Video-sharing site TikTok and streaming giant Netflix have limited and cut their services respectively in Russia following its invasion of Ukraine. 
TikTok said it had suspended live streaming and new content from its platform as it assesses tough new laws to crack down on ""fake news"" about Russia's armed forces. 
Netflix said it was pulling out in protest at the invasion. 
Visa, Mastercard and PwC also joined the list of western firms cutting ties.
TikTok, which has around 36 million users in Russia, said its move was about ensuring the safety of its staff and users. 
Since Friday, anyone who writes news deemed false about the military could face up to 15 years in jail.
Among other things, the Kremlin objects to the conflict being called a war, instead calling it a ""special military operation"". 
The BBC and other news outlets have already stopped reporting in Russia, saying they can no longer be independent. 
In a series of Tweets, TikTok said: ""In light of Russia's new 'fake news' law, we have no choice but to suspend live-streaming and new content to our video service while we review the safety implications of this law. 
""Our in-app messaging service will not be affected.""
BBC suspends its journalists' work in Russia

It added: ""We will continue to evaluate the evolving circumstances in Russia to determine when we might fully resume our services with safety as our top priority.""
Chinese-owned TikTok, which has one billion users worldwide, has been criticised for not speaking out against Russia invading Ukraine, unlike its peers Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, and Twitter. 
But in a longer statement on its website on Sunday, it described the war in Ukraine as ""devastating"", adding that it had ""brought pain to our community and our people"".
TikTok says it ""doesn't break down user numbers by country"" but we know that Russia is one of the company's top territories.
It's thought that around 36m people use the app and TikTok's new rules reduce them to spectators of other people's content. 
TikTok says it's making the move to protect its users from breaking Russia's new ""fake news"" laws. 
But it will no doubt help the company too. 
Moderating social networks during times of crisis is hard enough, but having to vet content under the new draconian laws in Russia puts all platforms in a tough position. 
I wouldn't be surprised if other apps took similar measures to protect themselves. 
Russia has many high-profile creators who make their living from TikTok so we can expect even more people to be motivated to protest against the ""fake news"" laws. 
The Kremlin may also lose out in the information war too with less pro-Russia content on people's timelines. 
Last week, Netflix temporarily stopped all future projects and acquisitions in Russia as it assessed the impact of Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.
But on Sunday, a spokesperson said: ""Given the circumstances on the ground, we have decided to suspend our service in Russia.""
The firm launched in Russia in 2016 and only has 1 million subscribers there - a fraction of the 220 million it has worldwide. 
But according to Variety magazine, the streaming platform had four Russian originals in the works. 
That includes the crime thriller series Zato, which was shooting and has since been put on hold. 
A host of companies have suspended their operations in Russia since it attacked its neighbour, including Apple, Jaguar Land Rover, H&M and Burberry. Many other firms are reviewing their positions, while some are looking to offload stakes in Russian ventures.
On Sunday, two of the Big Four accounting firms KPMG and PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC) said they would no longer have a member firm in Russia because of the invasion.
Visa, Mastercard and American Express also suspended operations in Russia, although the country's banks played down the impact on consumers.

Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Monday morning.
1. Fourth jab for vulnerable in Scotland
Covid boosters are being offered to vulnerable people in Scotland. The fourth jab will be given to older care home residents, over 75s and people over the age of 12 with suppressed immune systems. The rollout follows the latest guidance from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation.
2. Testing wind-down fears
The Covid testing system will be wound down in Wales over several months as the nation plans to scrap its remaining rules at the end of March. But there are concerns about this process, with ministers saying they are ""reluctant"" for it to happen. That's according to Wales' health minister Eluned Morgan who said one concern was whether the system would be ""ready to spring back"" if there was a new wave of Covid. Welsh Secretary Simon Hart said testing was now ""more targeted"".
3. School support
A school has created a wellbeing suite, which employs dedicated staff to help pupils as the country emerges from the pandemic. Head teacher Claire Huddart, from Horizon Community College, in South Yorkshire, says the mental health of her students is the ""worst it has been"", and she's spent more than £500,000 from her school budget on support. Take a look.

4. Funeral rites
Before the pandemic, the Muslim funeral ritual of washing and shrouding a person who has died before burial was carried out by older volunteers. But many of those are still shielding so are unable to perform the religious obligation called Ghusl. A scheme's been set up to teach younger volunteers how to carry it out. Read more here.
5. Sounds of a city
What happened to the sounds of city life when the pandemic hit and restrictions were imposed? Our absence meant the hustle and bustle was gone and replaced by different, more natural, sounds. Have a listen to what a PhD student found in Belfast city centre.

Although protests have become increasingly restricted in recent years, numerous rallies have taken place across Russia since the invasion.
In the last 11 days, more than 10,000 people have been detained at protests, OVD-Info says.
""The screws are being fully tightened - essentially we are witnessing military censorship,"" Maria Kuznetsova, OVD-Info's spokeswoman, told Reuters news agency from Tbilisi in Georgia.
""We are seeing rather big protests today - even in Siberian cities, where we only rarely saw such numbers of arrests.""

Earlier this week, government critic Alexei Navalny - who is in jail on fraud charges - called for daily demonstrations against the invasion, saying Russia should not be a ""nation of frightened cowards"".
However, a number of new laws have made it harder to protest in Russia in recent years, rights groups say.
""Although Russian legislation avoids explicitly using terms like 'permit' or 'ban'... it effectively requires organisers to seek authorisation for their assemblies,"" Amnesty International says., external
According to Russian human rights group, external OVD-Info - which was set up in 2011 - more than 2,500 people were detained across Russia on Sunday.

Protests did not just take place in Russia on Sunday, but around the world. In Kazakhstan - an ally of Moscow - a peace rally was permitted in Almaty, attended by around 2,000 people.
Anti-war protesters also took to the streets in cities like Brussels, in Belgium, and London.
In Ukraine itself, Russian troops occupying the southern city of Nova-Kakhovka opened fire to try to disperse demonstrators.    
A video from the city, in the Kherson region, shows protesters calling for the Russians to ""go home"" amid the sound of gunfire and stun grenades. The demonstrators appear to hold their ground.

Video shows people running to escape Russian shelling in Irpin, just outside of the capital Kyiv
On day 11 of the invasion, towns to the north-west of the capital  Kyiv came under relentless bombardment as Russian forces continued their attempt to break through towards the capital. 
There was heavy fighting with Russian forces in Bucha, Hostomel and Irpin, where barely a minute went by without an explosion, according to locals.   
At least four people - all from the same family - were reportedly killed as they tried to flee Irpin, after Russian mortar shells targeted a damaged bridge they were using.
Russia has been striking civilian targets in Ukraine, including hospitals, nurseries and schools, the Ukrainian deputy prime minister said.
Olha Stefanishyna told the BBC that, after ""strong resistance"" from the Ukrainian army, there had been an ""enormous operation"" by Russia against civilians.
She accused Russia of a ""terroristic plan"", with attacks coming from the air and also by land.
Fastest-growing refugee crisis in Europe since WW2, says UN
Ukrainian refugees have been arriving in the Polish border city of Przemysl
The number of Ukrainian refugees continues to rise sharply, with more than 1.5 million people having fled the country in just 10 days, according to the United Nations refugee agency, the UNHCR.
Filippo Grandi, the agency's high commissioner, has called it the fastest growing refugee crisis in Europe since World War Two.
Poland has seen the largest number of refugees arrivals, having welcomed 922,400 since 24 February, according to Polish border guards.
Mariupol evacuation halted again

A second attempt to evacuate people trapped in Mariupol collapsed after just a few hours, with both sides once again blaming each other for breaking the ceasefire.
The International Committee of the Red Cross had hoped to start evacuating 200,000 people from the besieged port city.
It says its teams began opening up the evacuation route from Mariupol to Zaporizhzhia before ""hostilities resumed"".
The Mariupol city council said the plans had been aborted because Russian shelling had made the safe evacuation of civilians impossible.
The city is now in its fifth day with no water, no power and no sanitation, while food and drinking water are fast running out.
Protests across Russia see thousands detained
More than 300 people were detained in St Petersburg
Nearly 4,000 people were detained at anti-war protests across Russia on Sunday, rights groups and Russian authorities say.
Some 1,700 people were detained in Moscow alone, the Ria news agency reported, citing the interior ministry.
The OVD-Info rights group says people were detained in 53 cities across Russia - from St Petersburg in the west to Vladivostok in the east.
Although protests have become increasingly restricted in recent years, numerous rallies have taken place across Russia since the Ukraine invasion.
More than 10,000 people have been detained since the war began, OVD-Info says.

Russian gymnast Ivan Kuliak is being investigated after wearing a national war symbol on his leotard as he stood next to a Ukrainian rival on the podium in Qatar on Saturday.
The International Gymnastics Federation (FIG) said it had opened disciplinary proceedings against Kuliak for his ""shocking behaviour"" at the Apparatus World Cup in Doha.
Kuliak earned bronze in the parallel bars final and displayed a letter 'Z' taped to his chest as he stood next to gold medal winner Illia Kovtun of Ukraine.
The letter Z has become symbolic with Russia's invasion of Ukraine and has been seen painted on the side of tanks and military vehicles, as well as being worn by pro-war politicians in Russia.
This weekend was the final opportunity for Russian and Belarusian gymnasts to compete after their countries were sanctioned by the FIG as a result of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
From Monday, Russian and Belarusian athletes, officials and judges will not be allowed to take part in FIG competitions or FIG-sanctioned competitions.

A soldier serves soup to a Ukrainian woman in the building of the main railway station of Przemysl which has been turned into a temporary reception centre for refugees
Refugees from across Ukraine are being welcomed as they arrive in the Polish border town of Przemysl, but there are concerns about how the relief effort can be maintained if the war goes on. 
""We have had 180,000 refugees in 10 days. If it carries on like this, we'll have had half a million people coming through by the end of the month.""
In the packed train station at Przemysl, eight miles from the Ukrainian border, mayor Wojciech Bakun is both proud of what his town - population 60,000 - is doing for Ukraine but also apprehensive about what could lie ahead. He is an imposing figure, dressed in fatigues as he strides through the elegant 19th Century station where waiting rooms and offices are now stacked with food supplies, bottled water, nappies and donations of clothes, and where Ukrainians are sitting on chairs or on the floor, surrounded by luggage, pushchairs and pets.
Wojciech Bakun (L) is the mayor of Przemysl which has seen 180,000 arrivals in 10 days
The relief effort here is dependent on volunteers, who are currently in their hundreds. Can that be sustained? ""Probably not,"" says the mayor. ""They are ready for a week or two, maybe a month, not for a long period of time. So we are thinking about the longer term and talking to international organisations about how to manage this if it goes on for longer.""
In the main ticket hall people who have travelled long distances are holding up bits of paper and cardboard with scribbled signs: ""Hostel for eight in Gdansk""; ""Can take a family - Warsaw""; ""40 places available on bus to Germany"". Przemysl is an obvious focal point because it's on the main line across the border, with trains coming in from Lviv, in the west of Ukraine. They are listed on the arrivals board but there's no certainty any more about the timetable. 
Signs offering help hang up around the station
Many refugees have travelled to Przemysl with their pets
Next to the platform where the Ukraine trains come in, I asked a Polish couple, Pawel and Magda, who they were waiting for. ""A woman with three cats,"" they said. It turned out that they had seen a Facebook post from a Ukrainian woman living in Taiwan, desperate to find someone to meet her 75-year old mother Lyudmila and give her a bed for a night or so before she could travel on.
Pawel and Magda had been waiting for five hours already. Did they know what train Lyudmila would be on? No, and her phone had run out of battery. How would they recognise her? Pawel took out a piece of paper from inside his coat with her name on it but said they'd be looking out for someone with three cats.
Mishal Husain will present the Today programme from Przemysl on Monday 7 March on BBC Radio 4. You can listen here
It's been striking for me to see how emotional many Poles are about the situation in Ukraine. There were tears in Pawel's eyes as he spoke about why he and Madga were prepared to stand in the station for so many hours, ready to take not only Lyudmila but others who might arrive with her. He is not the only one to have reacted that way: several people I met here broke down when I asked why they were moved to open their homes or help in other ways.
There are long links of history that straddle today's border between the two countries and familial and linguistic links too, but Poles also feel strongly because they can imagine how it feels to be up against the Russians. It is only just over 30 years since the collapse of communism here and there are longer memories too of Soviet occupation. And not everyone has confidence that being under the Nato umbrella, as Poland is, is sufficient protection from Vladimir Putin.
An exhausted refugee sleeps inside the train station
Even for Ukrainians who arrive here with a plan about where they ultimately want to get to, there is a palpable sense of shock about their changed circumstances. One woman in her 30s, who was with her 10-year old son Igor, said she wanted to get to Spain but that right now she was in a panic. It was getting dark. ""We will find somewhere to sleep and then in the morning we will think about what to do.""
Ilona, standing nearby, was part of a bigger group - her mother, aunts, cousins and their children. No-one had suitcases, just backpacks and carrier bags in which I could see food and toys. ""We wanted to be able to move easily,"" she said. She is only 22, a final-year medical student who doesn't know when or how she will complete her training to be a doctor, and with her father left behind in Kyiv.
""The people of Przemysl are warm-hearted,"" the mayor told me, and that is without a doubt true of attitudes to Ukrainians. But last week the local police said there had been an attack on three African refugees by four perpetrators, and another incident of verbal abuse. The mayor blamed a campaign of disinformation, with messages circulating suggesting local women were not safe and that people shouldn't leave their homes. The authorities are now appealing for everyone to stay calm and making it clear that there has been no increase in violent incidents. 
A special room has been set up in the railway station only for refugee mothers and children from Ukraine
If Poles are emotional, many Ukrainians are too - there is relief at making it to safety but also deep appreciation at what they find here - the offers of transport, accommodation, the donations, the support. In the large, high-ceilinged, gilded room that was the station's cafe someone has set up a toy kitchen and a Wendy house in one corner. Two mothers who have just arrived with three young children settle down gratefully next to it, relieved to have something to keep the little girls and the toddler boy occupied. But as soon as they are, and the women have a moment to themselves, I can see how drawn their faces are and how much is on their minds.
Olha is Ukrainian but lives in Germany - she's here to pick up her mother and offer a ride to anyone who needs it
There is however one bright smile among those at the station. It's Olha's - she is Ukrainian and has been living in Germany for years, travelling here from Heidelberg to pick up her mother. With the Ukrainian flag draped around her shoulders, she is holding up a sign offering rides to other arrivals too. ""I want to tell you that from my family only my mother is prepared to leave Ukraine,"" she says. ""Everyone else is staying to defend the country. And this is the end of Putin.""
Mishal Husain will present the Today programme from Przemysl on Monday 7 March on BBC Radio 4 from 06:00-09:00

Fedorov's mission to create a ""state in a smartphone"" has been put on hold
As Ukraine's military and citizens battle Russia's advancing troops, the country has opened a new front in the fighting - using tech expertise to rally Silicon Valley's support and undermine the enemy. Digital minister Mykhailo Fedorov is leading the charge, but some of his tactics are proving divisive.
From his underground shelter in a secret location in Kyiv, Ukraine's youngest cabinet minister is waging a digital war on Russia.
Using his preferred weapon - social media - Mykhailo Fedorov has been urging chief executives of big businesses to cut ties with Moscow. He's also taken the unprecedented move of setting up a volunteer ""IT Army of Ukraine"" to launch cyber-attacks against ""the enemy"". 
At only 31, Fedorov has shaped his government role around his lifestyle - he lives through and on his mobile phone. 
Before the war, his main goal was to create a ""state in a smartphone"", where 100% of government services would be offered online. Now that project is on hold, with every muscle strained on the digital war effort.
He has piled pressure on multinational companies to boycott Russia.
Apple, Google, Meta, Twitter, YouTube, Microsoft, Sony, Oracle... no tech giant has missed out on an official government letter. 
Fedorov then posts his letters on social media so the world can see, plus some of the replies.
It's impossible to say whether this has influenced the companies' actions, but most have changed their policy towards Russia in subsequent days - either stopping products being sold there, like Apple, or halting operations.
Saturday's announcement from PayPal that it was suspending services in Russia appeared on Fedorov's Twitter feed, external before it was reported in the media. So too did news that Samsung and Nvidia are stopping all business with Russia, something he publicly called for on his social feeds.
One tweet from Fedorov to Elon Musk soon after the invasion began brought quick results. Within 48 hours the billionaire tech mogul had adjusted his constellation of Starlink satellites and sent a lorry-load of internet-ready terminals to Ukraine. 
Mykhailo Fedorov with a Starlink terminal donated by Elon Musk
The service is a potential lifeline for the government if internet and telecommunication networks are damaged or destroyed, though Musk has since warned that the satellite dishes could become a target for Russian missiles and should be used with care.
Fedorov has more than half a million followers in total across Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and Telegram and uses them all to get his message across.
""Each platform is very important to us now and we are using every opportunity to attract large companies to this horror happening now in Ukraine. We are trying to bring the truth to the Russians and make them protest against the war,"" he told the BBC via email.
He speaks mostly in Ukrainian online, but since the crisis unfolded he's switched to English on Twitter, where he is having the most impact.
""Twitter has become an efficient tool that we are using to counter Russian military aggression. It's our smart and peaceful tool to destroy Russian economy,"" he says.
Technology researcher and author Stephanie Hare says she is not surprised Fedorov is having success.
""[He] is 31 years old. He gets it,"" she says.
Using persuasion and propaganda is a time-honoured tactic of warfare. But since social media companies entered the equation in the 2000s ""they have changed the calculus due to the speed and breadth with which people can disseminate their messages"".

EXPLAINED: Why Putin has invaded Ukraine?
IN DEPTH: Full coverage of the conflict
Fedorov's spokeswoman told me his young team was constantly coming up with new ideas, which the ministry then tries to implement at speed. Last week, Kyiv announced it would issue non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to fund its military. But some others have been controversial. 
Fedorov is urging crypto-currency exchanges to freeze the accounts of all Russian citizens, for example - an idea that many, including the CEO of the Binance exchange, says would ""fly in the face"" of the reason crypto exists.
The Anonymous hacker collective has declared ""cyber-war"" on President Vladimir Putin
And the ministry's launch of an ""IT Army of Ukraine"", including thousands of volunteer hackers from around the world - its Telegram group now has 270,000 members - has caused some unease. 
""Tech is the best solution against tanks,"" Fedorov told the BBC. ""The IT Army is directed against the digital and online resources of Russian and Belarusian business corporations, banks, and state web portals. We have shut down the operation of the web portal of the Russian public services, the exchange, websites of Tass, Kommersant, Fontanka, and other top media in Russia.""
So far the hacking seems to be mostly low-level cyber vandalism but Fedorov's team is also explicitly calling for attacks on railway and power grid networks which, if successful and disruptive enough, could cause harm to civilians. It makes some in the cyber-security world anxious.
""It's really important to be careful in this realm,"" says Suzanne Spalding from the Centre for Strategic and International Studies. ""If we get into destructive attacks on critical infrastructure being carried out by citizens I think we begin to run into the kinds of fog-of-war, misattribution, potential cascading impacts that weren't anticipated. We might see retaliation from one side for something a citizen has done and things can escalate fast.""
On Friday Ukraine's deputy chairman of the State Service of Special Communications, which works closely with Fedorov's department, defended the decision to rally hackers against Russia.
He said he welcomed illegal cyber-attacks on Russia from all groups, including the Anonymous hacking collective, because ""the world order changed on 24 February"" when the invasion started.
Hacking is also being carried out against Ukraine by people sympathetic to Russia, but currently Russia seems to be coming off worse. Its crack military hackers appear, so far, to have not played a major role, for reasons that are unclear.

15,15,Ukraine crisis: The West fights back against Putin the disruptor,"Sun, 06 Mar 2022 07:25:00 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-60597186,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-60597186?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,Several US presidents have failed to get the measure of him but now Europe has joined the fray things may change.,"Ukraine crisis: The West fights back against Putin the disruptor
Successive US presidents have struggled to get the measure of Vladimir Putin but now that Brussels and Berlin have joined the fray with such resolve, it's a different story, writes Nick Bryant.
It is often tempting to look upon Vladimir Putin as the millennium bug in a human and deadly form. 
The Russian president rose to power on 31 December 1999, as the world held its breath that computers would go into meltdown when the clock struck midnight, unable to process the change from 1999 to 2000. 
In the 20 years since, Putin has been trying to engineer a different kind of global system malfunction, the destruction of the liberal international order. The former KGB spymaster wanted to turn back the clock: to revive Russia's tsarist greatness and to restore the might and menace of the Soviet Union prior to its break-up in 1991. 
This Russian revanchist has become the most disruptive international leader of the 21st Century, the mastermind behind so much misery from Chechnya to Crimea, from Syria to the cathedral city of Salisbury. He has sought - successfully at times - to redraw the map of Europe. 
He has tried - successfully at times - to immobilise the United Nations. He has been determined - successfully at times - to weaken America, and hasten its division and decline.

Putin came to power at a moment of western hubris. The United States was the sole superpower in a unipolar world. Francis Fukuyama's End of History thesis, proclaiming the triumph of liberal democracy, was widely accepted. 
Some economists even peddled the theory that recessions would be no more, partly because of the productivity gains of the new digital economy. It was also thought that globalisation, and the interdependence it wrought, would stop major economic powers fighting wars. The same utopianism attached itself to the internet, which was seen overwhelmingly as a force for global good.

In the early days especially, the same misplaced optimism and wishful thinking coloured the west's approach to Putin - a figure, it is now obvious, who was trying to buck history and thwart democratisation, however many lives were lost in the process. 
Successive US presidents have played into his hands. Bill Clinton, the occupant of the White House when Putin came to power, handed this ultra-nationalist a popular grievance by pushing for the expansion of Nato right up to Russia's borders. As George F Kennan, the famed architect of America's Cold War strategy of containment, warned at the time: ""Expanding Nato would be the most fateful error of America policy in the entire post-Cold War era.""
Why Biden won't send troops to Ukraine
George W Bush completely misjudged his Russian counterpart. ""I looked the man in the eye,"" Bush famously said after their first meeting in Slovenia in 2001. ""I found him very straightforward and trustworthy… I was able to get a sense of his soul."" Bush mistakenly thought he could mount a charm offensive with Putin, and gently cajole him further down the democratic path. 
But even though Bush visited Russia more than any other country - including, as a personal favour, two trips in 2002 to Putin's home city, St Petersburg - the Russian leader was already displaying dangerously despotic tendencies. 
In 2008, Bush's final year as president, Putin invaded Georgia - what he called a ""peace enforcement operation"". The Kremlin argued then - and has continued to argue ever since - that it was hypocritical for Washington to complain about this violation of international law after Bush had invaded Iraq.  
George Bush hosted Vladimir Putin at his Texas ranch...
...which caused some excitement locally
Barack Obama sought to reframe US-Russian relations. His first secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, even handed her Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov a mock reset button (which was mistakenly labelled with the Russian word for ""overloaded""). But Putin knew that America, after its long wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, no longer wanted to police the world. 
When Obama refused in 2013 to enforce his red-line warning against Bashar al-Assad when the Syrian dictator used chemical weapons against his own people, Putin saw a green light. By helping Assad carry out his murderous war, he extended Moscow's sphere of influence in the Middle East when the United States wanted to extract itself from the region. The following year, he annexed Crimea, and established a foothold in eastern Ukraine. 
Despite being told by Obama to ""cut it out,"" Putin even sought to influence the outcome of the 2016 presidential election in the hope that Hillary Clinton, a long-time nemesis, would be defeated and that Donald Trump, a long-time fan boy, would win.
The New York property tycoon made no secret of his admiration for Putin, a sycophantic approach that seems to have further emboldened the Russian president. Much to Moscow's delight, Trump publicly criticised Nato, weakened the US post-war alliance system and became such a polarising figure that he left America more politically divided than at any time since the Civil War.

IN DEPTH: Full coverage of the conflict
Arguably, then, you have to reach back 30 years to find a US leader whose approach to the Kremlin has stood the test of time. After the fall of the Berlin Wall, George Herbert Walker Bush resisted the temptation to rejoice in America's Cold War victory - much to the astonishment of the White House press pack, he refused to travel to Berlin for a victory lap - knowing that it would bolster hardliners in the Politburo and military seeking to oust Mikhail Gorbachev. 
That magnanimity in victory helped when it came to bringing about the reunification of Germany, which was arguably Bush's greatest foreign policy success. 
Putin is obviously a more formidable adversary, harder to deal with than even Leonid Brezhnev or Nikita Khrushchev, the Soviet premier during the Cuban Missile Crisis. But since the turn of the century no US president has truly had his measure.
Bill Clinton pushed for the expansion of Nato which some said was a mistake
Joe Biden, like George Herbert Walker Bush, is a Cold War warrior, who has dedicated his presidency to defending democracy at home and abroad. Seeking to re-establish America's traditional post-war role as the leader of the free world, he has sought to mobilise the international community, offered military aid to Ukraine and adopted the toughest sanction regime ever targeted against Putin. 
As Russian forces amassed at the border, he also shared US intelligence showing that Putin had decided to invade, in ways that sought to disrupt the Kremlin's usual misinformation campaigns and false flag operations. 
His State of the Union address became a rallying cry. ""Freedom will always triumph over tyranny,"" he said. And while Biden does not speak with the clarity or force of a Kennedy or a Reagan, it was nonetheless a significant speech.
What's been striking since the Russian invasion started, however, has been the assertion of forceful presidential leadership from elsewhere. Volodymyr Zelensky has been lauded and lionised, as he has continued this extraordinary personal journey from comedian to Churchillian colossus.
Zelensky: A comedian president rising to the moment
In Brussels, the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, has been another commanding presence. This former German politician has been a driving force behind the decision, for the first time in EU history, to finance and purchase weapons for a nation under attack, a commitment that includes not just ammunition but fighter jets as well.   
Ursula von der Leyen
Her compatriot, the new Chancellor of Germany Olaf Scholz, has also shown more resolve in dealing with Putin than his predecessor Angela Merkel. At warp speed, he has overturned decades of post-Cold War German foreign policy, an approach so often predicated on caution and timidity towards the Russian leader. 
Berlin has sent anti-tank and anti-aircraft systems to Ukraine (ending the policy of not sending weapons to active war zones), halted the Nord Stream 2 Baltic Sea gas pipeline project, withdrawn its opposition to blocking Russia from the SWIFT international payments system, and even committed to spending 2% of its GDP on defence spending.
Putin's war prompts dramatic German U-turn
The biggest assault on a European state since World War Two has stiffened European resolve. But so, too, it seems has the relative weakness of America. Mindful of the botched US withdrawal from Afghanistan and possibility of a Trump 2.0 presidency, European leaders seem to have realised that they can no longer lean so heavily on Washington to defend democracy in this hour of maximum peril. Leadership of the free world has, in this crisis, become a common endeavour.
Even since the end of the Cold War, Washington has been calling upon European nations to do more to police its own neighbourhood, something they failed to do when the break-up of the former Yugoslavia sparked the Bosnian war. Historians may well conclude that it took a combination of Putin's aggressiveness, America's fragility, Ukraine's heroic resolve and the fear that Europe's post-war stability is truly on the line to finally make that happen.

Watch: What Americans think of Biden's Ukraine response
It would be naive to be swept away by the romanticism of Zelensky's speeches or to succumb to the dopamine high of watching the seizure of Russian-owned super-yachts unfold on social media. Putin is intensifying the war. But the last week has sent a message to Moscow - and to Beijing as well - that the post-war international order still continues to function, despite the deployment of the Russian war machine to bring about its collapse. Just as history never ended, nor has liberal democracy.
As Joe Biden put it in his State of the Union, during a passage in which rhetoric served also as sober analysis: Putin ""thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead, he met a wall of resistance he never imagined"".

A building on fire after a strike near the centre of Mariupol
A ceasefire, and a chance for civilians to leave, was announced on Saturday morning in the Ukrainian port city of Mariupol, where an estimated 200,000 people are trapped under heavy bombardment by Russian forces. 
The city arranged 50 buses, and many people travelled to the city centre to get them. But after less than two hours, Russia's army began shelling residential areas again, trapping civilians who had begun their escape.
The city is now in its fifth day with no running water, no power, no sanitation, and food and water are fast running out. 
Maxim, a 27-year-old IT developer who is caring for his grandparents in their sixth-floor apartment, spoke to the BBC on Saturday night to describe a day that began with hope and ended in despair. 
We tried to escape today, during the planned time of no shooting. We heard we could get out. 
As fast as I could, I packed four bags for me and my grandparents with warm clothes and food, and all of our remaining water, and I packed them into my car.  
My grandparents are in their eighties, they cannot help. I carried everything down six flights of stairs to my car. There is no lift now. 
Right when I was ready to drive, the shelling started again. I heard explosions near to us. I carried everything back upstairs as fast as I could to the apartment. From there, I could see smoke rising from the city and smoke rising from the highway to Zaporizhzhia where people were supposed to escape.
So I am still in my grandparents' apartment and the shelling and bombing has continued all day. But now instead of three of us here, there are nearly 20. 
Many people came into the city centre because they heard there was a ceasefire and buses to take them out, and to flee the shelling there. Then they could not get back to their shelters when it started again.  
So we have taken many people into the apartment. They are from the left side of the city, they say it is destroyed. All the houses are burning and no-one can put out the fires. There are many dead bodies lying in the streets and no-one can carry them.
I know three of the people from before, from my neighbourhood, but the rest I do not know. The oldest is a woman in her late 70s, the youngest is a small child. We also have two cats, a parrot and a dog. 
We have tried to make space for the women and children to sleep on the floor. We don't have any extra mattresses but we have put some spare carpet and clothes on the floor for them to lie on. 
We have run out of bottled water. We are down to the water that I filled in the bath before the taps went off. The gas is the only thing still working - we can use it to boil the bath water to drink. 
Cramped conditions in Maxim's flat in Mariupol
Today the police opened the stores and told people to take everything, because the people here have no food and drink. Our neighbours managed to take some candy, some fish and some fizzy drinks.  
The ceasefire was a lie. One side never planned to stop firing. If they say there is a ceasefire tomorrow [Sunday] we will have to try to go, but we don't know if it will be real. Maybe now we are better to hide.  
You can keep calling me as long as I have some battery left in my phone, but I don't know how long that will be. After today I am without hope. From now on we do what we have to each day only to survive and for our neighbours to survive. 
After that I don't know what comes next. We are very tired and we do not see a way out.

Katrin on holiday in happier times. She found her social media awash with fake posts after the invasion began
What's it like being a young Ukrainian experiencing war while wading through chaos and misinformation on social media? 
24-year-old Katrin awoke in Kyiv last Thursday to the sound of an explosion - and soon enough found her social media feed awash with distressing posts.
""The first thing we had to do was to pack and go to the basement,"" she tells me, now safe in her small hometown outside of Lviv where she escaped with her boyfriend, neighbours and their dogs.
""But right after we went down, I started scrolling Instagram. And it was all on my Instagram stories and my posts."" 
She wasn't just seeing scary, factual posts from friends, but false information - including comments on TikTok from accounts that claimed the war ""wasn't real"" or that it was a ""hoax"".
""After I blocked this one account, another sprung up with a profile picture of a different girl, writing to me in Russian,"" Katrin says.
The trolls have been prolific - and they have been interacting with young women across Ukraine. 
Rumours on Telegram 
Alina, 18, found herself in a total panic after seeing posts in Russian suggesting that her neighbourhood in Zaporizhzhya in south-east Ukraine was about to be shelled and destroyed. But the rumours were false.
Screengrabs of messages in Russia falsely claiming that an attack was imminent on Alina's town
Alina spoke to me from her bedroom, exhausted after nights of air raids and sheltering. She says that rumours moved rapidly on chat app Telegram, spread by people apparently setting out to cause panic.
""Russians specifically find our chats and write that something is exploding. Someone writes that there is a sign of a bomb in the area - then others refute the information,"" she says.
Alina pictured last summer in Ukraine
Another video she saw on Telegram suggested there had been an explosion at the airport in her hometown. It turned out to be a different explosion, in the nearby city of Mariupol. 
A video shared with false claims that there was an explosion in Alina's hometown
Old footage from other conflicts, including the massive blast in Beirut in 2020, has also been shared widely - including on TikTok, where clips have racked up millions of views. 
Marta is 20 years old and was stuck in the UK where she was visiting friends when the war broke out. She says she's seen videos from Syria and Iraq.
""But they posted them as 'Ukraine',"" she says.
She says videos on TikTok's For You Page - the main gateway into the video-sharing app - have left her terrified and angry, as she desperately worries for friends and family back home.

IN DEPTH: Full coverage 
Battling the trolls 
All three women have found themselves battling accounts posting comments in support of Russia.
The videos posted by one of the pro-Russian accounts Jess promoting false claims about the war in Ukraine.
""Some of them started to post videos, they started to call Ukraine 'liars',"" Marta says. 
Some were blaming Ukraine for the violence, writing ""glory to Russia"" - and others falsely suggested that the war was somehow staged. 
""Every time I decided to take a look at those accounts, they were a profile with zero followers, zero likes, zero following, with a profile picture of a Russian flag or something,"" Marta says.
Many of the TikTok accounts that the women shared with me appear to have lifted photos from other accounts online. Like Marta says, they have few or no followers, and they don't use their real names - or use generic usernames.
Marta has been battling pro-Russian trolls online
One I looked at used the name ""Jess"" and had just one follower. The only videos on the account are ones first shared just days ago, indicating that the account was created very recently.
Almost all of the videos the account did share featured debunked and false claims: that a woman who was injured during a Russian attack was an actor, that news coverage is filled with footage of old conflicts, and even that the war somehow isn't happening. 
One account Katrin ended up arguing with on TikTok again had few followers - its profile image appears to be copied from the Pinterest page of a Korean woman.
None of the accounts have responded to my attempts to get in touch - so it's hard to tell who is running them. Russia has created inauthentic accounts before to push messages and sow division. But it's also possible that the accounts are run by real people who believe false claims. 
Social media policies 
Misinformation is a problem social media companies have been grappling with for some time. Now their policies are coming under fresh scrutiny. 
Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, along with Twitter and Google, have all announced commitments to tackle false information and propaganda around the war in Ukraine. 
But it's apps like Telegram and TikTok - used a lot by young Ukrainians - is where much of this disinformation continues to proliferate. 
TikTok told the BBC it has ""increased resources to respond to emerging trends and remove violative content, including harmful misinformation and promotion of violence."" Telegram did not respond to our request for comment. 
It's clear that what's happening online is causing even more panic and pain in the real world. 
""We are scared by those who create this fake information,"" Alina tells me, ready to head yet again down to the basement as the air raid siren rings out.

Fighting has raged in Ukraine since Russia launched a full-scale invasion in February 2022. Russian forces have made small gains in recent months but now Ukrainian forces have staged a counter-offensive into Russia.
Here is a recap of recent significant events and the situation in Ukraine. 
Ukraine sends units into Russia
Ukrainian troops launched a surprise attack across the border in early August, advancing up to 18 miles (30km) into the Russian region of Kursk.
Almost 200,000 people were evacuated from areas along the border by the Russian government and President Vladimir Putin condemned the Ukrainian offensive as a ""major provocation"".
After two weeks, Ukraine's top commander claimed to control more than 1,200 sq km of Russian territory and 93 villages. The regions of Kursk and Belgorod have both declared a state of emergency.
The counter-offensive is seen partly as an attempt to force Russia to redeploy units from the east and relieve pressure on the beleaguered Ukrainian defences there, and partly as a bid to improve Ukraine's chances of a peace settlement.
Russian incursion north of Kharkiv
At the beginning of May 2024, Russian forces crossed the international border to the north of Ukraine's second-biggest city, Kharkiv. Several villages were seized and thousands of civilians fled.
Russia's main offensive has long focused on the eastern Donetsk region, but this was one of the most significant ground assaults since the start of the war and further stretched Ukraine's front-line defences.
The Russian push took place at the end of a four-month period when the US was not supplying weapons to Ukraine, due to a stalemate in the US Congress.  
The issue was finally resolved at the end of April, when the US passed a $61bn aid package to provide missiles, artillery and air-defence systems to the Ukrainian military.
Ukrainian forces eventually held firm and even though the city of Kharkiv has come under repeated attack from glide bombs fired by Russian warplanes, it remains beyond the range of Russian artillery.
Russia grinds forward in the east
The incursion north of Kharkiv was some distance from the main front line in the east where Russia has continued its offensive operations and been edging forwards since October 2023.
Eastern Ukraine has been contested territory since 2014, when Russian-backed fighters seized large swathes of the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions. 
Russia's biggest advantage is manpower and it has shown a willingness to throw soldiers at Ukrainian positions to gain a few metres at a time. 
About 1,200 Russian soldiers were being killed or wounded every day in May and June, the highest rate since the beginning of the war, according to Western officials.
In recent days, Russian troops have made some significant gains to the north-west of Donetsk and claim to have captured the small town of Niu-York.
In response, Ukraine has ordered the evacuation of the city of Pokrovsk, with a local military official telling residents that Russian forces were ""rapidly approaching"". 
The Russian advance towards Pokrovsk is the most notable change in control of the front line near Donetsk for several months. 
The last major change came when Ukraine withdrew its troops from Avdiivka, just north of Donetsk, back in February after months of fighting. 
Almost all of Avdiivka's pre-war population of more than 30,000 people have left and the town itself is almost completely destroyed.
To the north, areas around Bakhmut have remained a flashpoint and have endured some of the heaviest fighting of the war. 
Although Ukraine gained some ground around Chasiv Yar, which is situated on high ground some 10km west of Bakhmut, Russian forces have since made further advances in the area. 
Two and a half years of fighting
Russia's invasion began with dozens of missile strikes on cities all over Ukraine before dawn on 24 February 2022.
Russian ground troops moved in quickly and within a few weeks were in control of large areas of Ukraine and had advanced to the suburbs of Kyiv.
Russian forces were bombarding Kharkiv, and they had taken territory in the east and south as far as Kherson, and surrounded the port city of Mariupol.
But they hit very strong Ukrainian resistance almost everywhere and faced serious logistical problems with poorly motivated Russian troops suffering shortages of food, water and ammunition.
Ukrainian forces were also quick to deploy Western supplied arms such as the Nlaw anti-tank system, which proved highly effective against the Russian advance.
By October 2022, the picture had changed dramatically and having failed to take Kyiv, Russia withdrew completely from the north. The following month, Ukrainian forces recaptured the southern city of Kherson.
Since then, the battle has mostly been in the east of Ukraine with Russian forces slowly gaining ground over many months, while losing at least 50,000 troops - and probably many more.

19,19,Five ways the Ukraine war could push up prices,"Fri, 04 Mar 2022 22:09:49 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-60509453,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-60509453?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,Prices for everyday items could go up at a time when the cost of living is already rising.,"Five ways the Ukraine war could push up prices
Severe sanctions on Russia aim to isolate the country and create a deep recession there, but the economic fallout will also be felt by people around the world.
The sharp rise in the prices of things from oil and metals to wheat is expected to push up the cost of many everyday items from food to petrol and heating.
1. It might cost (even) more to heat your home
Russia is the world's largest natural gas exporter, which is vital for heating homes
People in the UK and Europe are already paying high prices for energy and fuel.
The Russia-Ukraine conflict has so far driven these even higher and caused the price of oil to jump to level in almost 14 years, while wholesale gas prices have more than doubled. 
If gas prices stay at that level, energy analysts have warned that household fuel bills in the UK could reach as much as £3,000 a year, while average UK petrol prices have repeatedly hit record highs, with the latest price at 155p and diesel at 161p. 
Russia is the second-biggest exporter of crude oil, and the world's largest natural gas exporter, which is vital to heating homes, powering planes and filling cars with fuel.
The UK gets only 6% of its crude oil and 5% of its gas from Russia, but the EU sources nearly half of its gas from the country.
If one country reliant on Russian supplies receives less gas, they have to replace it, impacting the supplies of gas for other countries - that's why British energy prices and bills are still affected in a similar way to European ones.
There are fears President Vladimir Putin might ""weaponise"" Russia's natural resources by reducing supplies of gas to Europe in response to sanctions. Politicians in Germany are calling for a ""national gas reserve"" to be created to protect consumers from price shocks.
Meanwhile, the US is discussing a potential ban on buying Russian energy which has also fuelled price rises.
Plane fuel is also linked to the price of crude oil and Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary has warned tickets for this summer will be higher than 2019, partly because of the rise in the price of oil.
2. Your food shop could cost more
Tinned goods could rise further if aluminium prices remain high
UK food producers don't import many items from Russia or Ukraine, but prices here may still rise because of an increase in associated costs, such as tinned cans and packaging and transport.
Meanwhile, the cost of everyday food items might rise in places like Turkey and North Africa, which rely on wheat and corn from Ukraine and Russia.
Both countries, once dubbed ""the breadbasket of Europe"", export about a quarter of the world's wheat and half of its sunflower products, like seeds and oil. Ukraine also sells a lot of corn globally.
Analysts have warned that war could impact the production of grains and even double global wheat prices.
More than 40% of Ukraine's wheat and corn exports went to the Middle East or Africa last year - and disruptions to supply could affect availability in these areas.
The UK, by contrast, typically produces more than 90% of the wheat consumed in the country. But farmers here might find themselves paying more for fertiliser, which is one of Russia's biggest exports.
3. Your mortgage repayments may rise
Homeowners in the UK would see mortgage repayments rise if the Bank of England's base rate went up
Inflation, which measures how fast the cost of living rises over time, hit 7.5% in January in the US - the highest level seen there since February 1982 - and rose by 5.5% in the UK. 
But one economist has warned it could rise close to 10% in major Western economies if the cost of energy and food is pushed up by dwindling supplies cause by the Russian-Ukraine conflict.
Such a figure might encourage the Bank of England and the US Federal Reserve to increase interest rates. The idea is that when borrowing is more expensive, people will have less money to spend. As a result, they will buy fewer things, and prices will stop rising as fast.
But in the UK, for example, about 2.2 million homeowners with mortgages linked to the Bank of England's base rate would see repayments go up, putting further pressure on household budgets that are already being squeezed by the cost of living.
4. Your pension might fluctuate - but don't panic
Widespread falls in share prices, such as those triggered on Thursday, are likely to be bad news for pension savers
Russian stocks crashed by as much as 45% in the wake of the Ukraine invasion with trading subsequently suspended, with banks and oil companies among the worst affected. 
It also led to steep falls on stock markets elsewhere around the world: in Europe the UK's FTSE 100 index has fallen over 6% since Russia crossed into Ukraine while Germany's Dax index is nearly 10% lower.
Many people's reaction to stock market changes is that they are not directly affected, because they don't invest money in stocks and shares. But there are millions of people with a pension whose savings are invested in the stock market.
If widespread falls in share prices are sustained then it's likely to be bad news for pension savers because the value of their savings pot is influenced by the performance of investments.
Some investors or savers might look to protect their money or assets by moving them to traditional ""safe havens"", like gold, especially as the markets are likely to see more volatility as the crisis develops.
But pension savings, like any investments, are usually a long-term bet and advisers say it's important not to panic about short-term movements up or down.
5. DIY and cars could cost more
Canned goods may become more expensive if metal price rises persist, the LME chief executive said
As a leading commodities exporter, Russia is one of the world's largest suppliers of metals used in everything from aluminium cans, to copper wires, to car components, such as nickel, which is used in lithium-iron batteries, and palladium, which is used in catalytic converters.
Everyday goods - which may seem far removed from the conflict - may rise as a result of it.
""When you buy your drinks can made of aluminium, or when you make renovations to your house and you need copper for your wiring, all of those prices do go into the overall inflationary pressure,"" the boss of the London Metals Exchange has warned.
If Vladimir Putin decided to cut off supplies of these metals in retaliation to sanctions, existing supply problems could worsen, with car firms having to find alternative sources.
Russia is also home to manufacturing hubs for brands like Stellantis, Volkswagen and Toyota. Some production has already been paused at Russian car plants, while shipping and delivery companies halting activity to and from the country is likely to impact the availability of new cars.

20,20,Ukraine: 'We try to tell them the truth' - parenting in wartime,"Sun, 06 Mar 2022 00:17:05 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-60632147,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-60632147?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,"In Ukraine, families are having to adapt to being at war. But what do you tell the children?","Ukraine: 'We try to tell them the truth' - parenting in wartime
A little girl clutches a doll at a checkpoint on the Ukraine-Slovakia border
In Ukraine, families are having to adapt to a terrifying new reality. How do you tell young children that you're at war? 
Ten days ago Anton Eine, a science fiction writer in Ukraine, had been due to launch his latest book - but then the Russians invaded. Now, he says, none of that matters any more. He is hunkering down in Kyiv with his wife and their three-year-old son. 
They live in a 24-storey apartment block with an underground car park, where people are sleeping on the concrete floor. It's bitterly cold, and Anton is worried about what might happen if the building collapses, so he and his family feel safer in a square concrete well between the lifts. That has become their sanctuary during the constant air raid sirens. They bring toys and their son's tablet and make sure he sits in the corner, which is the safest place. 
Anton says their son is worried, and asks lots of questions. ""Yesterday, my wife went downstairs and when she returned, he was asking, 'Mum, did they shoot you?' and she said 'No baby', and he said, 'Will they shoot me? I don't want them to go bang-bang'.""
How to deal with your anxiety about the Ukraine crisis
Anton says some parents have sewn badges with their child's blood group on to their clothes and are teaching them their home address and parents' names, in case they are separated. And while they hide in shelters or try to board trains to safety, many parents are also talking to each other about how the war is affecting their children, and how best to protect them from trauma. 
""Some parents tell the kids it's a game,"" says Anton. ""We are trying to tell our son the truth, but in a softer way, adapted to the mind of a three-year-old kid. 
""We tell him that bad soldiers attacked us and the good soldiers, the ones with the Ukrainian flag, are the ones who protect us, and you don't need to worry here in this sanctuary.""
His own son's drawings don't appear to show any signs of trauma, but some of Anton's friends have older children, and the pictures they draw clearly show they've been affected by the situation. 
A friend of Anton's shared her four-year-old son's drawing after spending the night in a bomb shelter - it shows people fleeing a big red devil
The parents and staff from his son's nursery stay in touch via the social media app Telegram, where they share advice about how to talk to the children about what's going on. This even included a tutorial on how to explain to the kids why it was OK for adults to swear now, while it was not OK in normal life. ""Because people are swearing right now,"" says Anton. 
They have become more relaxed about other little things, too. ""Because of this situation, he has to watch much more cartoons than normal, and is eating much more sweets than normal. We need something to occupy him - he has to not pay too much attention to what's going on.
""The psychologists advise us to be gentler with kids in these times, and to love them much more than usual,"" says Anton. 
When it comes to safety, though, they have to be quite strict. Their three-year-old quickly learned that when there's a siren, the family have to run and hide. ""As soon as we hear sirens or get a notification we shout, 'To the shelter!' and whatever he's doing he leaves it and runs. He understands that the situation is extraordinary. It even surprises us how well children understand the necessity to behave properly.""
Evacuees and a child, sitting on top of a suitcase, wait for a train to Romania from Lviv
As the Russian shelling gets worse and the convoys close in, many Ukrainian parents have decided to flee their homes with their young children in tow. 
Hanna, a scientist, left Kyiv and travelled to Poland with her two sons, who are eight and six years old. For days, they had been at home listening to explosions, the windows trembling, and she somehow had to tell them what was going on. She found it hard to strike a balance between reality and how much a child's mind can take. 
""This was a challenge for me as a mother because I have to choose between how to explain the truth, but at the same time not to scare them too much,"" she says. ""So I was just telling them that we are under attack, and at the moment we are safe, but when we feel we have to move, they have to listen.""
Her parenting style had to change, too - there was no room for discussion. ""Normally I ask them to do something, but this is a time to get orders.""

After a few days of shelling, Hanna felt she no longer wanted her children to hear the bombs and decided to leave Ukraine. ""It was a very, super hard decision,"" she says.
Her children had to make a hard decision too - they could only take one of their toys. Her eldest chose Toothless, a toy dragon from the How to Train your Dragon series, and her youngest chose a Transformer toy car that turns into a robot. It was a huge decision for them, says Hanna - perhaps as momentous as it was for her to leave her country. ""I think that we were in the same emotional decision-taking position.""
It took them 52 hours to reach safety in Poland. Hanna's ex-husband came with them for the first part of the car journey but then had to turn back, to fight. Hanna says travelling in a war zone with two kids was exhausting and she can understand why many of her friends are choosing to stay nearer home. 
Now they are safe, but the boys ask lots of questions, about their grandparents and especially their father, who has stayed behind. ""Heart-breaking questions, because they ask me every day if he is alive, or if he still has his hands and legs. They are afraid that he can get super hurt.""

Hanna tells them to try and live in the present. ""All we have is just now. At the moment we are safe,"" she says. 
How much to tell their children is something all parents are having to weigh up. Oksana fled her home town of Lviv, in the west, and is now also in Poland. Her six-year-old daughter is autistic and hates loud noises, so she found the air raid sirens very scary. She could tell her mother was nervous too, so Oksana told her the truth about what was happening.
""I was explaining that it's a war and we need to be safe, and that a lot of people are dead now because of all this,"" says Oksana. ""I think it is important that when children are old enough to understand they are not misled, because they can sense the atmosphere is bad.""
Iryna's son is just two, and she has decided not to tell him too much. After spending three nights in a bomb shelter they left Irpin, a small city near Kyiv, and went to western Ukraine. 
She told her son they were going to stay with friends, because he's too young to understand that they're in danger. ""I didn't tell him that it's a war. I'm not sure I have to when he's so young, because I think it makes this situation only worse.""
As for Anton and his family, the Russian troops are closing in and they may have to evacuate soon. He's not sure where to. ""No-one knows which place is the safest - so it's gambling,"" he says. 
Hanna, Oksana and Iryna spoke to Outside Source on the BBC World Service.

WWII Soviet propaganda poster depicting hoped-for victory over the Nazis - which Putin constantly references
There are moments when the tectonic plates of history shift beneath our feet and Europe is violently remade. It is time to recognise that we are at such a moment. Time too, to stop saying that it is somehow unbelievable that this can be happening in 2022.
It is no more unbelievable now than it was in 1914 or 1939 - nothing predetermined that they would be years when darkness would descend. That's not to say, of course, that we are on the edge of a war that will suck in the rest of Europe or even the world. 
The point is that peace is always fragile - and that what happens even in the most distant corners of Europe will always affect all of us.
Drawing the right lessons from those big moments when everything changes is not easy.
The French military commander Ferdinand Foch called the end of World War One a ""20-year"" ceasefire - because he felt the victorious allies had overplayed their hand in dealing with the defeated German Empire. He was about a year out.
Ferdinand Foch circa 1914
The question for our generation is whether or not we made a similar miscalculation over how to handle Russia when the Soviet Union collapsed. We rejoiced as Poland, the Baltic States and others took their place among the free nations of the world. 
Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic - once occupied by Soviets - joined Nato in 1999. The Baltic states of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia followed five years later.
But the dark energy that drives Vladimir Putin is the other side of that coin. He saw Russia diminished, humiliated and stripped of what he saw as its right to a buffer zone of subordinate states.
He illustrates the point with a story - which might even be true - from his own shadowy past. A former colonel in the counter-intelligence corps of the KGB, Putin was reduced to acting as a part-time taxi driver. One imagines he would have been rather a difficult one.
At some point he conceived an almost mystical concept of restoring lost Russian greatness. He must have been encouraged by the way in which he got away with the annexation of Crimea - from Ukraine - in 2014. After all, four years later we were enjoying the World Cup in Russia.
Western Europe's main reaction to the end of the Cold War was to take a 30-year holiday from serious defence spending.
Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev announced the Soviet Union's dissolution and his resignation on 25 December 1991
At one point a few years ago, only four of Germany's 128 fighter aircraft were combat ready and the Dutch had a plan to dispose of every one of their heavy tanks. The Dutch have thought again and the Germans are now proposing to spend an extra €100bn (£83bn) on defence. 
It is good of course that Germany reflects on its past, but it's even better that it is thinking of the future too.  
The German Chancellor Olaf Scholz is a Social Democrat who certainly didn't run for office on a promise of raising defence spending but he has risen to the historical demands of the moment rather impressively.
""With the invasion of Ukraine we are in a new era,"" he told the German parliament - defining the challenge of that new era as a simple question: ""Whether we allow Putin to turn back the clock, or whether we mobilise power to set boundaries for warmongers such as Putin.""
They are extraordinary words from the leader of a country where politicians once argued that the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941 made it impossible to stand up to the Kremlin.

Sweden, which is wealthy and well-armed but militarily non-aligned, was the first country to feel colder winds blowing from the East and perhaps the first to act. It is increasing defence spending by an extraordinary 40% in its current five-year cycle - raising new infantry regiments and buying American Patriot anti-aircraft missiles.
The Swedish Defence Minister Peter Hultqvist said simply: "" We have a situation where Russia is prepared to use military means to achieve political goals.""
So the rather decadent view - that the only weapon the West would ever need is economic sanctions - is out of fashion now. You can't fight tanks with banks. No-one wants to see this continent turned into an armed camp of course, but when you feel those tectonic plates shifting you have to shift with them. Acting now - buying weapons and donating money - is the easy bit when the hot sharp stab of outrage is fresh. 
But this new age of containment is going to call for much more. The will to stand with Ukrainians first - but then the grit, vision and staying power to stand guard over freedom wherever and whenever the next attack might come.

How does it feel to be shunned?,"War in Ukraine: Russians on boycotts, sanctions and cancellations
There have been protests in many parts of the world against Russian leader Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine
Since last week's invasion, there has been a global cultural and sporting backlash against Russia. But do these bans matter to Russians who are now considering their own future as Western air spaces close down, their currency slumps and curbs intensify on free press?
Its athletes were banned from the Beijing Winter Paralympics the day before the games got under way and Russia's footballers won't be playing Poland this month. Musicians from around the world are calling off planned events in Russia.
""It's hard to imagine how long it will take Russia to be considered a part of the world cultural landscape again,"" Lena, a young woman who works in Moscow, told the BBC.
Lena asked for her identity to be protected - the names of some other interviewees in this article have been changed too. 
Images of destruction and suffering in Ukraine have horrified people around the world, and many Russians too
""It's impossible to support the illusion of normality while the human tragedy unfolds in Ukraine,"" Lena said. 
""Certainly, moaning about isolation and economic disasters is nothing compared to what the poor people of Ukraine are experiencing every day now, and we all feel absolutely shattered that helping them is treason here."" 
It's dangerous to speak out in Russia  - thousands of protesters against the war have been detained, while the country's leadership has pressed on with the assault.
'Everything will be different'
Russia's leaders have so far defied the unprecedented wave of sanctions aimed at devastating its economy if it doesn't change course. 
Boycotts and sanctions have failed to stop Russia's invasion of Ukraine
Cutting sporting and cultural ties means further pain, and revives bitter memories of decades of Cold War division.
In sport the country has been almost universally ostracised. Its absence from the Beijing Winter Games will be painfully apparent after a last-ditch U-turn by officials.

Russia's athletes have also been banned from this year's world championships and its figure skaters, an event in which the country excels, have been barred from all competitions. 
The International Judo Federation made a point of suspending Russia's leader Vladimir Putin, a keen judoka, as its honorary president.

Four years after hosting the World Cup, Russian football clubs and national teams have been suspended from all international competitions. Spartak Moscow, one of Russia's leading clubs, has been thrown out of the Europa League.
Ultimately, though, the people the BBC spoke to said these now felt almost like a distraction. 
Andrey (name changed), who has a club season ticket, says ""it doesn't matter"" in the bigger picture.
""Football, like everything else, is going to be different now. It will be part of our new life which we can't even imagine,"" he says. 
""And the main thing is that no-one asked us if we want this new life. What will it be like? It's all very frightening. Of course, it's nothing compared to what people are feeling in Ukraine."" 
There have been shows of support for Ukraine at football matches since Russia launched its invasion of the country
He says ""humdrum problems"" like boycotts ""are the least of our concerns"". 
""The whole structure of life is changing now, from TV shows to telephones and cars.  I don't see the point in trying to guess how it's going to change.""

Watching the war on Russian TV - a whole different story
In recent years Russians have become used to seeing Western performers in their country, a huge shift from Soviet times when travel to and from the country was difficult.
But many foreign performers have now put on hold or cancelled gigs, festivals and shows in Russia to express horror at what's happening. 
Anyone wanting to catch the Russian leg of tours by Eric Clapton, Iggy Pop or Louis Tomlinson faces being disappointed. 
Franz Ferdinand were due to perform in St Petersburg and Moscow in the summer
They've joined a growing list of stars - the Killers, Imagine Dragons, Green Day, Franz Ferdinand are some of the others - who've cancelled shows in Russia or put them on hold in protest at the war.
Lena says many Russian acts don't want to entertain ""in these horrible times"" either. The day after the invasion, singer Valery Meladze, comedian Danila Poperechny and a host of other  celebrities appealed in a video for it to end. 
Over the past week, Russia's entertainment world has been turned upside down.
Moscow's Bol festival,, external where Nick Cave was among those due to headline in June, is one event that won't be taking place.
""I organised conferences and showcase festivals with musicians from all over the world and we discovered loads of new bands. During the pandemic we tried to stay cheerful,"" the festival's co-founder Stepan Kazaryan posted on Facebook. 
""Now I have a one-way ticket and nothing else. Nothing but shame for what certain people with the same passport as me have done to our closest neighbours. We'll never, ever be able to redeem ourselves.""  
Cinema fans and those using online streaming services are also affected amid the backlash over the invasion. Global film and TV giants like Disney, Warner Bros, Sony and Paramount have paused or cancelled planned releases in Russia. 
Spotify's music service is unavailable.

Marina, a Muscovite in her 60s, said: ""So far we can still watch movies online but I think the distribution of films to cinemas is affected.
""We feel very bad. It [the war] was not what we wanted."" 
'A horrible feeling of powerlessness'
But how much are Russians likely to feel the effects of being cut off in sport and culture? 
There's an impression in the West that Russians will feel pain from the sanctions and boycotts by losing their freedom to travel, enjoy music, concerts and culture.
Is it naïve to think being deprived of these things will change Russian people's views? 
""It's not, but it is simply impossible: there are more police in the streets than people,"" says Lena. 
An anti-war protester is detained by security forces in St Petersburg earlier this week
""Last weekend over 6,000 people were arrested. And not just ordinary people but children and elderly WW2 veterans with anti-war posters too.""
In the space of a few days huge changes have taken place, and no one knows if things can go back to how they were. 
""There is a general feeling that the life we know is crumbling,"" said political scientist Ekaterina Schulman, who was presenting on Echo Moscow radio station when it was taken off air this week for broadcasting ""false information"" about the military action in Ukraine.
She says it's too early to gauge the effect of Western measures on Russian public opinion. 
Everyday life goes on in Moscow, but many are still taking in what's been changing
""At the moment people are panicking or in denial and just can't understand what's happening. A large number of people don't follow the news at all. They watch TV very occasionally. So it will take a while for them to hear about it.""
She said Russians were now worried the borders might be closed and they wouldn't be able to get out.
""In the last couple of days a lot of people have been leaving Russia to avoid anticipated repressions and being called up into the army.  They're flying to Istanbul, Yerevan and Tbilisi."" 
Lena says things like music, entertainment, films and exhibitions ""are now not a priority - not even in the top 10"". 
""It feels like it's not a post-Covid depression any more. It's just depression and a horrible feeling of powerlessness.""

24,24,"Ukraine war: 'My city's being shelled, but mum won’t believe me'","Fri, 04 Mar 2022 18:32:49 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-60600487,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-60600487?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,These Ukrainians say their Russian relatives only trust the narratives they see on TV at home.,"Ukraine war: 'My city's being shelled, but mum won’t believe me'
Oleksandra says her mother repeats the narratives of what she hears on Russian state TV
Oleksandra and her four rescue dogs have been sheltering in the bathroom of her flat in Kharkiv since the shelling began. 
""When I heard the first explosions, I ran out of the house to get my dogs from their enclosures outside. People were panicking, abandoning their cars. I was so scared,"" she says. 
The 25-year-old has been speaking regularly to her mother, who lives in Moscow. But in these conversations, and even after sending videos from her heavily bombarded hometown, Oleksandra is unable to convince her mother about the danger she is in.  
""I didn't want to scare my parents, but I started telling them directly that civilians and children are dying,"" she says. 
""But even though they worry about me, they still say it probably happens only by accident, that the Russian army would never target civilians. That it's Ukrainians who're killing their own people.""
It's common for Ukrainians to have family across the border in Russia. But for some, like Oleksandra, their Russian relatives have a contrasting understanding of the conflict. She believes it's down to the stories they are told by the tightly-controlled Russian media.
Oleksandra's dogs have been a source of support during the bombing
Oleksandra says her mother just repeats the narratives of what she hears on Russian state TV channels. 
""It really scared me when my mum exactly quoted Russian TV. They are just brainwashing people. And people trust them,"" says Oleksandra. 
""My parents understand that some military action is happening here. But they say: 'Russians came to liberate you. They won't ruin anything, they won't touch you. They're only targeting military bases'.""
While we were interviewing Oleksandra, the shelling went on. The internet connection was weak, so we had to exchange voice messages. 
""I've almost forgotten what silence sounds like. They're shelling non-stop,"" she said.
But on Russian state TV channels on the same day, there was no mention of the missiles striking Kharkiv's residential districts, of civilian deaths, or of four people killed while queuing for water.
State TV channel Rossiya 1 refers to the war as a ""special operation""
Russian state TV channels justify the war by blaming Ukrainian aggression, and continue to call it ""a special operation of liberation"". Any Russian outlet using the words ""war"", ""invasion"" or ""attack"" faces being blocked by the country's media regulator for spreading ""deliberately false information about the actions of Russian military personnel"" in Ukraine. 
And now a new law has passed through the Russian Parliament that means people who spread ""fake"" information about Russia's military forces could be jailed for up to 15 years.
Some Russians have taken to the streets to protest against the war - but these demonstrations were not shown on the main state television channels.
Watching the war on Russian TV - a whole different story
Mykhailo, a well-known Kyiv restaurateur, didn't have the time or inclination to watch Russian TV coverage of the invasion. 
When shelling of Ukraine's capital started, he and his wife were concentrating on how to protect their six-year-old daughter and baby son. 
Mykhailo with his father before the war
At night their children woke up at the sound of explosions and couldn't stop crying. The family made the decision to move to the outskirts of Kyiv and then flee abroad. 
They travelled to Hungary, where Mykhailo left his wife and children and came back to Western Ukraine to help the war effort. 
He was surprised not to have heard from his father, who works at a monastery near Nizhny Novgorod in Russia. He called his father and described what was happening. His father replied that this wasn't true; there was no war and - in fact - Russians were saving Ukraine from Nazis. 
Mykhailo said he felt he knew the power of Russian propaganda, but when he heard it from his father, he was devastated.

""My own father does not believe me, knowing that I'm here and see everything with my own eyes. And my mum, his ex-wife, is going through this too,"" he says. 
""She is hiding with my grandmother in the bathroom, because of the bombardment.""
Russian media has been tightly controlled for many years and viewers are given an uncritical view of Russia and its actions around the world. 
""The state narrative only ever shows Russia as the good guy."" says Dr Joanna Szostek, an expert in Russia and political communications at University of Glasgow. 
""Even the tales they tell about World War Two, the Great Patriotic War, Russia has never really done anything wrong. And this is why they won't believe it now.""
Most Russians, she says, don't look for other points of view. She believes the one-sided narrative that is highly critical of the West helps explain why Russians can have opposing views to their relatives in neighbouring countries. 
""People who criticise Russia have for so long been presented as traitors or foreign agents; critics are all foreign agents working for the West. So you don't even believe your own daughter.""
Anastasiya's parents live in a small village 20km (12 miles) away from the rebel-held Donetsk People's Republic. The village is still under the control of Kyiv authorities, but Russian state TV channels are always on in their house. They even have the clock set to Moscow time - a throwback to the Soviet past. 
So when on 24 February, Anastasiya woke up in Kyiv to the sound of sirens, she knew how her parents would react.
'My mum was the first person I called when I jumped out of bed at five, disoriented. She was surprised I called and sounded really calm, almost casual,"" she says.
Anastasiya, a BBC Ukrainian correspondent who moved to Kyiv 10 years ago, heard bombs exploding after waking and was worried about where would be hit next.
Anastasiya - and her cat - have left home
""I called my mum again. I told her I was scared. 'Don't worry', she said, reassuringly. 'They [Russia] will never bomb Kyiv'.""
But they are already doing it, Anastasiya replied.  
""I told her there were casualties among civilians. 'But that's what we had too when Ukraine attacked Donbas!', she said, laughing. For a moment I couldn't breathe. Hearing my mum say this with such cruelty just broke my heart.""
Anastasiya believes the image Russian media has created is one of the ""glorified Russian army"" ridding Ukraine from Nazis. For years she avoided political arguments with her parents, but this time she slammed the phone down on her mum. 
We spoke to Anastasiya when she was travelling away from Kyiv after four nights in a bomb shelter. Her mind was on an uncertain future. 
""There are a lot of thoughts in my head now. What will happen to us all? Where is this going? Will I ever come back? Will I ever see my parents again? I still love them deeply, but something inside me has broken and I don't think it can ever be fixed.""

Watch: Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant appears on fire after shelling (3 March 22)
""By the grace of God, the world narrowly averted a nuclear catastrophe last night.""
That was the verdict of the US ambassador to the United Nations on Friday, after Russia attacked and seized a nuclear power plant in Ukraine.
Buildings at the Zaporizhzhia plant - the largest in Europe - were damaged after it was hit by shelling.
The UN's nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), says that none of the safety systems at the plant were affected, and there was no release of radioactive material.
But it is still a very risky situation.
""For the first time this morning, I'm frightened,"" Sheffield University nuclear materials expert Prof Claire Corkhill told BBC News.
As well as the Zaporizhzhia plant, Russia has taken control of the now-retired Chernobyl plant - the site of the worst nuclear incident in history.
Experts have stressed that there are important differences between the two plants.
The Zaporizhzhia site is far more secure, according to Dr Mark Wenman of Imperial College London.
He says the reactor is in a steel-reinforced concrete building that can ""withstand extreme external events, both natural and man-made, such as an aircraft crash or explosions"".
The Zaporizhzhia plant also does not contain any graphite in its reactor.
At Chernobyl graphite caused a significant fire and was the source of the radiation plume that travelled across Europe. 
Towns near Chernobyl were abandoned following the nuclear incident
However, scientists say a military attack on the reactor itself isn't the only threat. Disruption to its electricity supply could also cause serious issues.
""You don't need to hit directly a plant to get a problem,"" said Olexi Pasiuk, deputy director of Ecoaction, an energy pressure group in Ukraine. 
The Ukrainians were in the process of taking the reactors offline to protect them. Only one of the six reactors operational at the power plant is now thought to be running.
But reactors cannot just be turned off like conventional energy supplies. They must be cooled slowly over 30 hours, which requires a constant electricity supply to the plant. 
A disruption to this supply - and therefore the cooling process - could lead to radiation leaking into the surrounding environment.
A loss of cooling like this was experienced at Japan's Fukushima plant following the 2011 tsunami.
In that case a loss of power caused a meltdown in three of its nuclear reactors.
Fukushima disaster: What happened at the nuclear plant?
If people are exposed to leaked radiation it can cause severe immediate and long-term health impacts, external including cancer.  
This was seen in 1986 at Chernobyl.
Russia may be trying to curb Ukraine's power capabilities, Prof Corkhill said.
""They're taking the rectors offline. This means they're shutting down the nuclear reaction and putting them into a safe and stable state.
""And this could be the intention of the Russians: if you want to target their power supply, you attack a building close to the power plant and force operators to shut it down.""
There are four major nuclear plants in Ukraine, and the defunct Chernobyl.
Russia has control of Zaporizhzhia and Chernobyl and it is approaching a third site - the south Ukraine nuclear power plant.
There are also smaller plants and radioactive disposal sites which store waste material from nuclear power operations across Ukraine.
On 27 February, Russian missiles also reportedly hit the site of a radioactive waste disposal facility in Kyiv. 
Ukraine's nuclear inspectorate said no radiation leaks were reported, external and the plant was not directly damaged.
For now, Russian forces - who have blamed the attack on Ukrainian saboteurs - have allowed staff to remain in the control room at Zaporizhzhia, to run operations.
But world leaders have accused the Kremlin of acting recklessly. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said it could ""directly threaten the safety of all of Europe"", and Ukraine's president accused Russia of ""nuclear terror"".
IAEA director general Rafael Mariano Grossi said: ""We shouldn't wait for something like this to happen [again].""
He plans to travel to Ukraine to negotiate with Russian forces for the safe operation of all power plants in Ukraine.

26,26,Ukraine war: Why Kherson and Mariupol are key to Russian success,"Fri, 04 Mar 2022 12:54:25 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-60604876,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-60604876?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,There are both strategic and historical reasons why the offensive in southern Ukraine is vital for Russia.,"Ukraine war: Why Kherson and Mariupol are key to Russian success
The Ukrainian city of Mariupol has come under heavy shelling
 While Russian troops in the north and east of Ukraine have struggled to seize important targets, including the capital Kyiv, their advance into southern Ukraine appears to be more successful.
Russia sees the south as vital to the success of its invasion, and has been laying siege to several southern cities and captured the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which is Europe's largest. 
The operation in the south was launched from Crimea, which was annexed by Russia from Ukraine in 2014 and is home to a sizeable Russian military presence. 
On Wednesday, Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby said that Russia has a ""sophisticated and healthy architecture"" there. 
A look at the map below shows how crucial the peninsula is as a base to the assault on southern Ukraine.
Russian troops are moving into Ukraine from Crimea, spreading east towards Mariupol and west towards Odesa, threatening to cut off Ukraine's maritime access which would inflict huge economic damage on the country.
""Strategically, there are major ports in that region that really allow Putin's forces to strangle any ability for Ukraine to be supplied via sea,"" Karl Qualls, professor of history and Russia specialist at Dickinson College, told the BBC.
To the east of Crimea, Russian forces are pushing to Mariupol, a city of 450,000 people, which is encircled and coming under heavy shelling. Water and power supplies have been cut off, and residents have told the BBC that they are terrified. 
If Mariupol falls, it would give Russia control of one of Ukraine's biggest ports and create a land corridor between Crimea and the Russian-backed regions of Luhansk and Donetsk. 
Connecting Crimea with mainland Russia via the rebel-held areas would make it much easier for Russia to move goods and people to and from Crimea. Russia has wanted this since 2014, when the conflict in the east began. 
Currently the peninsula is connected to the Russian mainland only via a single bridge, built at great expense after the Russian annexation. 
Nuclear power plant seized
North-west of Mariupol, Russia has seized the Zaporizhzhia power plant. In normal times the plant produces around 20% of Ukraine's electricity, so by taking it Russia controls a significant portion of Ukraine's possible power supply. 
The Russian military has also occupied the city of Kherson which is located where the Dnieper river meets the Black Sea, a important location for troops to move further into Ukraine. 
""We're seeing them exploit the capture of Kherson,"" Dr Jack Watling from the Royal United Services Institute told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""They're now on the western side of the Dnieper and able to push both further up the river and towards Odesa.""
Russia says its forces have surrounded Ukraine's largest nuclear power plant
If Russia is able to move further west, to Odesa and beyond, it would not only cut off Ukraine's access to the sea but also surround the country on three sides.
""If they take Odesa, they have a key city to create a strategic arc around Ukraine. With Belarus in the north and Donbas to the east, they've all but encircled the country,"" Catherine Wanner, professor of history and Russia and Ukraine expert at Penn State University, told the BBC. 
Novorossiya
There is also a historical context to Russia's southern invasion. The region of Ukraine stretching from Odesa in the south to Luhansk in the east was taken by the Russian Empire in the 18th Century after a series of wars with the Ottoman Empire. It became known as Novorossiya, or New Russia. 
Under the Soviet Union, most of Novorossiya was part of the the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic which later turned into modern-day Ukraine. 
In 2014, after the annexation of Crimea, Russian President Vladimir Putin claimed that although Russia lost the territory of Novorossiya for various reasons, its people remained there. 
""The mythology that Putin promotes is that these are Russian lands,"" said Professor Qualls. ""It was part of the Russian empire but it wasn't Russians who lived there. There were far more Romanians than there were Russians, and Ukrainians were dominant.""
In 2014, separatist militants in Donetsk sported the tsarist-era ""Novorossiya"" flag
Nevertheless, the idea took hold, and for a brief period in 2014 the self-proclaimed separatist republics of Luhansk and Donetsk wanted to recreate Novorossiya, even sporting its tsarist-era red and blue flag. 
Russia's historic claim to Ukrainian land has been a frequent theme for President Putin in the run up to the invasion, but Professor Wanner says it should not be taken seriously. 
""Mr Putin has shown himself unashamed in terms of fashioning highly creative historical interpretations to invade and annex territory - Novorossiya is a flimsy justification"", she told the BBC.

A man and a child escape from the town of Irpin after heavy shelling on the only escape route used by locals
Most of the front pages show refugees in Ukraine - as the Sun puts it, external - ""running for their lives"". 
It says innocents were slaughtered in an attack which the Daily Express, external describes as ""pure evil"". 
The Times reports, external how civilians on the road from Irpin ""threw aside their suitcases and plastic bags and dived under the trees for cover"" as Russian mortars landed.
Next to a graphic photograph of a mother and her children slumped on the ground after being killed outright, the paper says the video of the attack has shocked the world - and the footage confirms that Russian forces are ignoring an agreement to offer safe passage to fleeing civilians. 
The paper says that pausing to let civilians flee and then hitting them as they do so is a tactic that Russia has used before in Syria and Chechnya - the aim being to crush morale and beat people into submission. 
Under the headline ""'Barbaric' Putin rains downs terror"" the Daily Telegraph describes, external how the journey was already nerve-wracking and difficult before the attack came, and says the family who died ""didn't stand a chance"".
It says the mortar shell exploded like an almighty thunderbolt leaving the family dead amid their bags. 
The paper quotes a former chief prosecutor at the UN special court, David Crane, who is gathering evidence of potential war crimes. 
He says there are ""literally thousands of violations that have been committed in the last week"". 
The Telegraph writes that the Russian troops' tightening grip on Irpin, to the west of Kyiv, could be the first permanent foothold they have on the capital - their earlier efforts at lightning advances having largely been repelled. 
The Guardian says, external indiscriminate Russian shelling threatens to turn the humanitarian crisis into genocide.
The Sun quotes, external the home secretary saying that all Ukrainian refugees will be allowed to come to Britain.
The papers reports that Priti Patel has vowed to relax existing rules after making a ""harrowing"" visit to the Ukrainian border. 
It says that she intends to investigate the ""legal options"" to create a humanitarian route.
The message from the Daily Mirror , externalabout the refugees is ""save them"".
It says the British government has issued just 50 visas for those fleeing the fighting, and says we must do more.

The Financial Times says, external the West is weighing up banning Russian oil, which it says would have potentially serious consequences for the global economy. British officials are quoted as describing such a ban as a ""drastic move"".
The Daily Mail leads, external with comments from the professional head of the armed forces, Admiral Sir Tony Radakin, that a Russian victory is not inevitable.
It says he gave the most optimistic assessment yet of how the conflict may end, saying the invasion was in a mess, and that Russian forces had been decimated. 
The paper says the stalling of a convoy of hundreds of Russian vehicles and an estimated 15,000 troops is a ""highly embarrassing example of ineptitude"".
The Daily Telegraph reports, external another danger facing those fleeing the conflict - sex traffickers. 
It says young women and unaccompanied children are being targeted and Polish police have made several arrests of suspected traffickers preying on the vulnerable, with the promise of a lift and accommodation.

A mother whose son died from heart disease has urged parents to know the signs and trust their instincts if they think their child is seriously ill. 
Jordan Simon was diagnosed with dilated cardiomyopathy at the age of 16 after several trips to hospital, was given a heart transplant and managed to live his dream of being a holiday park entertainer before his death in November, aged 25.
His mum Sarah Tustin, from March in Cambridgeshire, said she did not blame doctors for missed opportunities to diagnose him sooner but that he would have died ""within hours"" if she had not been persistent.
She said: ""Because he was young, the doctors couldn't possibly think he had heart disease. If there's parents out there that have got teenagers that are having the same symptoms, breathless, lethargic, do not accept the first diagnosis from the hospital or doctors.""
Research by charity Cardiac Risk in the Young, external found about 12 people aged under 35 died in the UK each week with an undiagnosed heart condition.

During the coronavirus pandemic, cities throughout the world emptied as lockdown restrictions were implemented. 
A PhD student from Queen’s University Belfast used this time to make recordings for his final research project. 
Georgios Varoutsos used his daily lockdown walks to record the sounds of Belfast city centre. 
Like many cities throughout the UK, Belfast had previously been dominated by the sound of human activity. During lockdown, these were replaced by subtle industrial, urban and natural sounds. 
The results can be listened to by downloading the free Echoes app and it was showcased as part of the 2022 Northern Ireland Science Festival.
BBC News NI merged Georgio’s sound files with drone footage taken in Belfast city centre during and after lockdown.

The parents of a five-year-old girl have said they believe she is the only child in the world to have a rare genetic condition.
Isla was born with mandibuloacral dysplasia, which causes features of premature ageing.
The family have said they do not know what her future holds and have used social media to raise awareness of her condition.
Prof Pradeep Vasudevan, consultant clinical geneticist at Leicester's Hospitals, said: ""Isla's condition is very rare - fewer than 50 cases have been recorded in medical literature.  
""Because of this, many cases most likely go misdiagnosed or undiagnosed making it difficult to determine the true frequency of mandibuloacral dysplasia in the general population.""

A video of a man's dramatic escape from the path of a container ship has been captured on a mobile phone.
Harvey, 16, was on a ferry travelling to Southampton from the Isle of Wight when he spotted a man in a dinghy in the path of a container ship.
He said: ""I saw him trying to start his engine. He jumped overboard and swam.""
The Harbour Authority for Southampton Water said the man was recovered from the water by a patrol boat and taken to hospital after treatment for shock.

35,35,Why doesn't Ukraine attack the Russian convoy? And other questions,"Fri, 04 Mar 2022 18:04:14 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-60617145,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-60617145?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,Correspondents and experts answer questions from readers on the BBC News website,"Why doesn't Ukraine attack the Russian convoy? And other questions
It's more than a week since Russia began its invasion of Ukraine. 
Residents of the capital Kyiv and several other cities are under bombardment from Russian missiles. 
A nuclear power station also came under attack, causing an international outcry.
Readers of the BBC News website have been sending in questions about the situation. Some of them are answered here by:
James Waterhouse, reporting for the BBC from Kyiv
Frank Gardner, the BBC's security editor
Prof Claire Corkhill, nuclear materials expert at the University of Sheffield
The bigger picture - Frank Gardner
How is military aid getting into Ukraine? Why doesn't the Ukrainian air force attack the long Russian convoy? - David Finch
Ukraine's western border with Poland and other Nato countries is still not in Russian hands  (the Russian invasion has come from the three other sides - north, south and east), so there is still a corridor for supplies to come in. 
The Black Sea coast however is now largely under Russian control and deemed unsafe for most shipping. 
Everyone is baffled as to why Ukraine has not done more to attack the Russian convoy as it is a sitting duck for drone and airstrikes. 
There are several possible explanations, Ukraine may be running out of armed drones and its small, outnumbered air force may be wary of being shot down by Russian air defence batteries. 
Ben Barry from the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) suggests the Ukrainians may well be safeguarding what resources they do have in readiness to counter-attack when the Russians get closer to Kyiv.
What exactly will it take for Western powers to get involved here? - Rob Frank
The West has made it clear it will only get involved militarily if Russia attacks a Nato country. Ukraine is not in Nato but nearby countries Poland and the Baltic states are, hence Nato has been rushing reinforcements to bolster those countries' borders. 
That said, Western countries are supplying Ukraine with ""defensive"" equipment to help it try to repel the Russian invasion. This includes anti-aircraft and anti-tank missiles. 
Some are calling for Nato to introduce a no-fly zone to stop Russian planes from carrying out airstrikes on Ukrainian cities. But Nato says it won't do that as it would entail shooting down Russian planes and that could lead to war with Russia.
So far I have heard nothing about prisoners of war. Are both sides taking any? - David Taylor
Yes. There are reports of Russian conscripts who have been taken prisoner and been given mobile phones to call home. 
Their families, we are told, thought they were just being sent to the Donbas region on a small operation, or even an exercise, but certainly not a full-scale invasion.
Does Nato have any strategy for Russia attacking operational nuclear plants in Ukraine? - Barry Johnson
I don't think anyone even foresaw this, but beyond a lot of rhetoric condemning it as reckless and unacceptable, there's not a lot the West can do, short of military intervention. This has been ruled out, as there are full-scale battles raging across Ukraine. 
On the other hand, it is not in Russia's interest to have a nuclear contamination disaster so close to its borders so the scenario of a nuclear plant being targeted may not be repeated.

The attack on the Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant - Prof Claire Corkhill
How worried should we be? 
The situation at the Zaporizhzhya power station is now under control and there has been no release of radioactive material. At the  site, the reactors are being shut down, which puts them into a safe state. 
The reactors themselves are well-shielded and resistant to fire or impact. More generally speaking, we should be concerned that nuclear facilities are military targets, because there are real risks of a nuclear accident.
How would it affect us here in the UK if something was to happen to the nuclear plant? - Victoria Udell
We are really too far away for there to be any hazard from radioactivity being released in the event of an accident. 
If an accident were to occur, it wouldn't be quite like the one that occurred at Chernobyl in 1986. There, the graphite in the core caught fire and, because it burned for 10 days, the radioactive smoke was lifted high into the atmosphere and spread widely around Europe. 
The reactors in Ukraine do not contain graphite, so are unlikely to catch fire or spread radioactivity widely.
Footage of the fire which followed shelling at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant
What would really happen if a fire broke out or a bomb did get dropped directly at the plant or in the cooling units? - Maria 
If there was a fire inside the reactor building, it would be instantly extinguished by the automatic safety systems. The reactor buildings themselves are fairly robust, so the nuclear fuel should be quite safe in there. 
An explosion would only occur if there was a nuclear meltdown, which could be caused by the electricity supply to the site AND the back-up generators being damaged. If this happened to an operating nuclear power plant, then there could be an explosion like the one that happened Fukushima. 
At Zaporizhzhya, the reactors are being put into a ""shutdown"", which means a nuclear meltdown could not happen.
How dangerous was the attack on Ukraine's nuclear plant?
The view from Kyiv - James Waterhouse
What's your life like right now as a reporter in Kyiv? Are there signs of normal life? 
The day-to-day couldn't be more different from just over a week ago. 
We often covered the politics of this crisis, maybe even filmed with people across Kyiv, a city we could freely move around in.  
Now we are covering a full-scale war. Events are moving so quickly, and we find ourselves in and out of a bomb shelter like thousands of others.
The food we are having for now is still fresh - often Ukraine's signature borscht soup as well as ham and cheeses. 
However, we are the extremely lucky ones. We've spoken to people now living in Metro stations where there is no running water or food being provided.  
Above ground, the normal full pavements and busy nightlife have disappeared. Instead, there are blockades and military checkpoints. 
Occasional friendly smiles have been replaced with nervous, wary looks. You can see the weight of tension on people's faces as they wait for what might be coming.
An underground metro station used as a bomb shelter in Kyiv
If Kyiv is eventually surrounded by Russian forces, would airdrops of supplies (food, ammunition) be possible, like the Berlin airlift? - Fred Williams
It's not clear yet what would happen if Kyiv was surrounded. 
Negotiators from both Ukraine and Russia have agreed to create ""humanitarian corridors"" to let citizens escape the fighting.
It's possible Ukrainian forces could use these temporary ceasefires to resupply, as it was agreed food and water could be delivered to cities where there's been the heaviest fighting.
For now, supermarkets and pharmacies can stay open in cities. Stock is more limited and there are long queues though. 
The distant rumbling of shells exploding is becoming more continuous as well. You become quite sensitive to the smallest changes. Occasionally a crackle of gunfire will make you jump.
Russian troops are continuing to mostly advance from the east and north, and the worry is Kyiv will find itself under a form of military chokehold, as we've seen with other cities.

Radar equipment is being used to survey the site near Melrose
A clearer picture of Scotland's largest Roman fort is expected to emerge after hi-tech geophysical surveys in the Borders.
Some of the country's leading historical surveyors have descended on Trimontium, near Melrose, to use the very latest in ground penetrating radar.
It's the first time the equipment, which was used recently at Stonehenge as well as at Viking ship burial sites in Norway, has been used at a Roman site in Scotland.
A fort was first built by the invading Roman army at the site beneath the Eildon Hills in about 79AD, and grew in size and importance to support a population of up to 3,000 at its height.
Dr Kayt Armstrong said the survey could ""fill in a lot of gaps"" in knowledge of the site
Trimontium's fortunes mirrored that of Rome's expansion north of Hadrian's Wall and the later retreat with the fort finally being deserted for good in about 180AD.
The fort was only rediscovered in 1846 during the construction of a nearby railway.
Following several 20th Century archaeological explorations and surveys - particularly a major five-year dig between 1905 and 1910 - the size and significance of Trimontium has emerged.
Experts believe that the latest survey on the scheduled site, which is conducted with permission from several heritage bodies, will lead to an even clearer picture of the fort being available for future studies.
Project lead Dr Kayt Armstrong said: ""Despite Trimontium being a well-known site and having had a series of excavations in the past, we don't have accurate information about where some of the previous trenches were.
""The high density radar will let us relocate the excavation trenches from 1910, and allow us to use modern mapping methods to pull them all together and work out how they relate to what's beneath the ground.
""We are hoping, with this fantastic technology, to fill in a lot of gaps.""
Among the key objectives of the surveys is to pinpoint the exact location of the bath-house and principia (principal's building).
The high-resolution images that the radar will produce could also lead to other discoveries.
A group of volunteers has been trained to help with the work
Geophysics expert James Adcock, who has worked on 80 Time Team programmes, is excited by what will emerge.
He said: ""It is very rare that we get onto sites of this status.
""Being able to tie everything onto one model is very important for us.
""Pinning down what has been done before, along with this cutting-edge technology survey, allows us to see Trimontium in a level of detail never experienced before.""
A community aspect has been added to the surveys, with volunteers being trained in using geophysics and analysing the results.
James Adcock said the work would give a level of detail never previously seen
Trimontium Heritage Officer, Rob Longworth, has welcomed their involvement.
He said: ""We will have around 30 volunteers on site.
""The volunteers will be given a rare opportunity to learn how to use geophysics equipment, and with their help we hope to be able to identify the exact site of the bath-house.
""The Trimontium Trust is all about telling stories about the Iron Age in the Borders region, and the Roman occupation.""
He said the surveys would give a better understanding of the site and allow them to provide ""even more stories"" of what happened there.
""With the construction of the new Trimontium museum and this survey taking place, it's an exciting time for all of us,"" he said.
The AOC Archaeology Group surveys, using equipment loaned by commercial company SYGMA, were set to last for about a week.
After that, they will be analysed to see what more they have to say about the area's Roman past.

The UK, EU, and US governments have responded to Russia's invasion of Ukraine with devastating sanctions against the billionaire businessmen perceived to be in President Vladimir Putin's inner circle.
Mr Putin has warned his allies for many years they should protect themselves against such measures, particularly as relations soured with the US and EU countries after the annexation of Crimea.
But while some of those closest to him took his advice and remained invested in Russia, others kept their money in palatial properties overseas and football clubs, and their companies remained listed on foreign stock exchanges. 
They now find themselves scrambling to hold on to their assets amid the most comprehensive economic penalties imposed in the modern era. Here's what we know about some of them.
SANCTIONED BY: US, EU, UK
Said to be one of Mr Putin's favourite oligarchs, Alisher Usmanov is also one of the richest, worth an estimated $17.6bn, according to Forbes, external. A former professional fencer, the EU describes him as a ""businessman-official"" who helps the president solve his business problems.
Born in Uzbekistan while it was still part of the Soviet Union, he runs USM Holdings, a huge conglomerate that involves mining and telecoms, including Russia's second biggest mobile network MegaFon. 
The EU announced sanctions against him, external on 28 February, and the US, external and UK , externalhave followed suit. He has called the sanctions unfair and said all the allegations against him were false.

USM Holdings appears to be hoping to avoid EU sanctions as he owns just under 50% of the shares. His superyacht Dilbar, named after his mother, is undergoing a refit in Hamburg and is at risk of being seized.
In the UK, his main visible investments are in property. In London he owns Beechwood House, a £65m country house with grounds in the heart of the city, and just outside London in Surrey, he owns a Tudor mansion, Sutton Place. Both have been frozen by UK authorities. 
His business partner Farhad Moshiri owns Everton, and Mr Usmanov's companies USM, MegaFon and Yota have been key sponsors at the club, with suggestions his involvement was even closer. Everton suspended the sponsorship deal last week, and Mr Moshiri quit as a USM board member.
SANCTIONED BY: UK, EU
One of the most high-profile Russian billionaires because of the phenomenal success of his football club Chelsea FC, Roman Abramovich was sanctioned later than some others, possibly because he is less obviously influential than other Putin allies.
How influential he is in the Kremlin is much debated. Some suggest he is merely tolerated by Mr Putin, but the UK believes the two are close, external and that Mr Abramovich has made money out of the relationship, being awarded lucrative contracts for the FIFA 2018 World Cup in Russia, for example. 
Mr Abramovich strongly denies having close ties to Mr Putin or the Kremlin, but the UK portion of his estimated $12.4bn fortune is now frozen. Just before the UK sanctions were announced, he put Chelsea up for sale for £3bn. His £150m house in London's Kensington Palace Gardens in London was also reportedly up for sale.
Mr Abramovich made his money in the 1990s and was one of the original oligarchs during Boris Yeltsin's presidency. His biggest break was buying the oil company Sibneft at a knockdown price. His assets include the third-longest yacht in the world, Eclipse, which recently left the British Virgin Isles, heading east across the Atlantic. His other mega-yacht, Solaris, is in the Mediterranean.
He had started to withdraw from the UK in recent years. In 2018 he decided not to apply to renew his UK visa, and has instead been using his newly acquired Israeli passport to visit London. And while he used to go to every Chelsea home game, in recent years he was rarely seen at Stamford Bridge - and now he is banned from entering the UK.
SANCTIONED BY: US, UK
When President Putin came to power, Oleg Deripaska was immensely rich, his wealth peaking at about $28bn - but he is now thought to be worth a mere $3bn, external.

He fought his way to a fortune in the 1990s, coming out on top in a vicious battle for the aluminium industry. The US said he was involved in money laundering, bribery, extortion and racketeering, and reported allegations that he had ""ordered the murder of a businessman, and had links to a Russian organized crime group"". He denies the allegations. 
He suffered badly in the 2008 financial crisis and needed Mr Putin to bail him out. In 2009, President Putin humiliated him by suggesting publicly that he had stolen a pen. Since then, he seems to have worked himself back into favour and was described in the Mueller report - a US investigation into Russian efforts to interfere in the 2016 US presidential election - as being ""closely aligned"" with the president. When it announced its sanctions, the UK also described him as closely associated with Mr Putin.
He founded a green energy and metals company, En+ Group, which is listed on the London Stock Exchange, but  reduced his stake in it to below 50% when he was subjected to US sanctions in 2018, external. At the time, one of Mr Deripaska's companies, Basic Element, released a statement calling the sanctions ""groundless, ridiculous and absurd"".
He owns a vast art deco property, Hamstone House in Weybridge, Surrey, which he has been trying to sell for £18m but has now been taken off the market. He also owns a yacht, Clio, which was recently seen in the Maldives.
Unlike many sanctioned oligarchs Mr Deripaska has been vocal about his view on the war, taking to social media to call for peace. ""Negotiations need to start as soon as possible!"" he wrote.
SANCTIONED BY: US, EU, UK
Igor Sechin's connections to Vladimir Putin run long and deep, according to the EU which announced sanctions against him on 28 February, external. He is said to be one of Mr Putin's most trusted and closest advisors, as well as a personal friend, and the two are thought to be in daily contact.
His progress was made through ruthlessly pushing aside opponents - his nickname in the Russian press is Darth Vader. A leaked US embassy cable from 2008 described him as ""so shadowy that it was joked he may not actually exist but rather was a sort of urban myth, a bogeyman, invented by the Kremlin to instil fear"". The US imposed sanctions on him in 2014, which he called ""totally unjustified and illegal"". They announced new sanctions against him on 24 February, external.
Mr Sechin has spent his career alternating between jobs in politics and business, sometimes holding senior jobs in both at the same time. When Putin was prime minister, he was a deputy prime minister, and now runs the state oil giant Rosneft. 
Mr Sechin worked with Mr Putin in the mayor's office in St Petersburg in the 1990s, and is widely believed to have been in the much-feared intelligence service, the KGB, although has never openly admitted it. 
Based in Russia, no-one knows how much money Mr Sechin has, but the French have seized a yacht called Amore Vero that was linked to him after his second wife Olga Sechina kept posting photographs of herself on board. They have since divorced.
Beyond that there is little sign he has substantial wealth overseas that could be easily uncovered, and it may be hard to track down and freeze any more of his assets. 
SANCTIONED BY: US, UK
Alexey Miller is another old friend of Vladimir Putin's. Something of a grey man, he too has built his career on loyalty to the president, starting when he was Mr Putin's deputy on the foreign relations committee of the St Petersburg mayor's office in the 1990s. 
Alexey Miller, right, with Mr Putin in February this year
He has run the immensely powerful state-owned gas company Gazprom since 2001, but it was a surprise appointment and it is widely assumed that he is just carrying out the orders of his old boss. The US ambassador to Moscow in 2009 described Gazprom as ""inefficient, politically driven, and corrupt"".
Mr Miller was not sanctioned after the annexation of Crimea in 2014, but when he was added to the list in the US in 2018, external, he said he was proud. ""Not being included in the first list. I even had some doubts - maybe something is wrong? But I am finally included. This means we are doing everything right,"" he said.
He does not appear to have easily traceable assets outside Russia and there is no information about his net worth.
SANCTIONED BY: EU, UK
The EU describes Pyotr Aven (pictured on the left) as one of President Putin's closest oligarchs, and Mikhail Fridman as an enabler of Putin's inner circle. Together the two men created Alfa-Bank, the largest private bank in Russia. 
The Mueller report said Mr Aven met with Putin in the Kremlin about four times a year, saying he ""understood any suggestions or critiques Putin made during these meetings were implicit directives, and there would be consequences for Aven if he did not follow through"".
They were warned by Mr Putin in 2016 to protect their interests from future sanctions. This week the pair stood down from the London-headquartered LetterOne investment group they founded almost 10 years ago because their shares were frozen by EU sanctions on 28 February, external. Mr Aven also stood down as a trustee of the Royal Academy of Arts in London.
The two businessmen said they would ""contest the spurious and unfounded basis for the imposition of these sanctions - vigorously and through all means available to them"".
Mr Fridman, thought to be worth around $12bn, external, lives in London in a house next to Lord's Cricket Ground and also owns a huge property, Athlone House in north London, that he paid £65m for in 2016. 
At a London press conference on 1 March, he said the Ukraine war was a ""huge tragedy"" but would not criticise the Kremlin directly saying to do so could put the jobs of hundreds of thousands of employees at risk.

39,39,"From Grozny to Aleppo to Ukraine, Russia meets resistance with more firepower","Sat, 05 Mar 2022 16:37:11 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-60631433,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-60631433?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,"Russia answers resistance with big guns and sieges. Ukrainians pray that will not happen to them, writes the BBC's Jeremy Bowen in Kyiv.","From Grozny to Aleppo to Ukraine, Russia meets resistance with more firepower
Buildings in Kharkiv in ruins after sustained Russian bombings
As I write this, the centre of Kyiv and much of its suburbs are largely untouched. Sirens and alerts punctuate the day. 
Everyone here knows that could change, very quickly. By the time you read this, it might have. 
Ukraine's second city, Kharkiv, has already felt some of the force of the Russian way of war. So have Mariupol and other cities in the east. 
Russia answers resistance with firepower. Rather than send in men to fight from house to house and room to room, their military doctrine calls for a bombardment by heavy weapons and from the air to destroy their enemies. 
Kharkiv and the other cities and towns have suffered grievous damage, and as far as we know many civilian casualties. The seat of Kharkiv's local government was badly damaged in a missile strike that was filmed. Russian President Vladimir Putin might be sending a message to Kyiv - look to the east, because this could happen to you. 
The depressing conclusion I've drawn from other wars in which I have seen Russians in action is that it could get much worse.  
'The ground was shaking'
So far, Mr Putin has not given the order to inflict the kind of damage that Russian forces brought down on Grozny, when the Russian republic of Chechnya rebelled in the 1990s, and in Syria since Mr Putin intervened in force in 2015.
I covered the first Chechen war when it started in the winter of 1994-1995. Just as in Ukraine, the Russian army made serious military blunders in ground operations. Armoured columns were ambushed by Chechen rebels in narrow streets and destroyed. Many conscript soldiers did not want to fight and die. 
Before the invasion of Ukraine, military analysts assessed that Russia's forces were now much more professional. Perhaps they are, but Russia's invasion has once again been slowed by logistical bottlenecks, tactical mistakes and terrified teenagers who had not been told they were going to war - as well as resistance as fierce as anything the Chechens offered in 1995. 
Chechnya declared independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, and in 1994 Russian forces invaded. The bombing of Grozny was intense
In the second Chechen war from 1999-2000, Russian forces again laid siege to Grozny, and intense fighting lasted weeks
Jeremy Bowen (left) with colleagues Scott Hillier and Steve Lidgerwood reported from Grozny in January 1995
In Chechnya, Russia's answer was to use its firepower. In a few weeks, artillery and air strikes reduced the centre of Grozny, a typical concrete and steel Soviet city, to rubble. I was in Minutka Square, a centre of Chechen resistance, on a day when it was hit by repeated air strikes. Civilians were mostly in cellars, risking death every time they went out to find water or food. 
In Minutka Square that day, Chechen fighters were killed by cluster bombs, and buildings set on fire. Twenty-four hours later, the entire main avenue of the city was hit by missile strikes and enveloped in smoke and flame. The ground was shaking where we were filming. 
Overwhelmed from the air
The most devastated places I have seen in years of war reporting, apart from Grozny, were in Syria. The connection is the destructive power of the Russian military. 
Mr Putin's decision to intervene in Syria saved the regime of Bashar al-Assad and took a big step towards his objective of restoring Russia as a world power. Two decisive victories over rebels in Syria, vitally important for the regime, were delivered by the ruthless use of Russian firepower. 
The first was in Aleppo at the end of 2016. The eastern side of the city, which had been held by a variety of rebel factions throughout the war, fell after it was pulverised by shelling and air strikes. The Assad regime did not need any encouragement to shell Syrians, but the Russians brought a much greater level of destructive power. Strategic bombers based at home and in Iran delivered devastating strikes. 
The tactic used in Syria was to encircle and besiege rebel-held areas, pound them from the air and from artillery batteries, and in the end exhaust the defenders and any civilians who had not managed to escape. Many of them were killed. 
In a devastated street in Aleppo in January 2017
In Eastern Ghouta in Syria in June 2018, with BBC cameraman Nik Millard
When I was able to drive through Eastern Aleppo a few weeks after it fell, destruction went on for mile after mile. I couldn't see a building that was untouched. Entire neighbourhoods were left in ruins. Streets were blocked with mountain ranges of rubble. 
I saw the same tactics work in Eastern Ghouta, a string of rebel held towns and farmland on the edge of the Syrian capital. Its capitulation in 2018 was the end of the battle for Damascus, that had looked at first as if it could go the rebels' way. That changed after the US decided in 2013 not to strike the Assad regime when it used chemical weapons in Douma, one of the area's towns. The long fight turned decisively in the regime's favour after Russia entered the war in 2015. 
Eastern Ghouta's defenders dug an underground tunnel city to escape the air strikes and shelling. But siege and overwhelming firepower wins battles. That is because defenders get killed and exhausted, and civilians, however defiant, are subjected to such fear and misery that they welcome the respite that surrender brings. 
In Kyiv, one of the big questions on everybody's minds is whether they are going to get the treatment meted out not only to Kharkiv, Mariupol and the rest, but also to Chechnya and Syria. 
Will the sanctity of Orthodox shrines create the restraint that was absent in attacks on Muslims in Chechnya and Syria? Putin himself has written about Ukraine's significance in Russia's history. Will he be prepared to destroy Ukraine to regain it? If sanctions and Ukrainian resistance threaten his regime's stability, will he take more extreme measures? 
The record shows that the Russian military compensates for weaknesses in the capabilities of its ground forces by turning to the big guns. Ukrainians are praying that will not happen here.

40,40,Jane Campion: Power of the Dog director thrilled with her Hollywood comeback,"Sun, 06 Mar 2022 00:13:54 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-60562041,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-60562041?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,The award-winning director is championing women in Hollywood after a break away from the big screen.,"Jane Campion: Power of the Dog director thrilled with her Hollywood comeback
When Oscar-winning filmmaker Jane Campion signed up to adapt Thomas Savage's 1967 novel The Power of the Dog, she deliberately sought out a female cinematographer to work alongside. Specifically Ari Wegner, a name you're going to be hearing a lot more often from now on. 
It may be 2022, but the combination of both a female director and a female director of photography is still a rare occurrence in Hollywood.
The pair combined to create an unsettling and menacing western which tackles toxic masculinity and stars Benedict Cumberbatch as complicated, malevolent cowboy Phil, who forms an unlikely friendship with a younger man, Pete (Kodi Smit-McPhee).
The film is leading the pack at this year's Academy Awards with 12 nominations, including best picture, best director and best cinematography - Wegner could be the first woman to win the latter.
For many, that female recognition is cause for celebration after the so-called ""male gaze"" has dominated Hollywood for so long.
But is there such thing as ""the female gaze"" and if so, what does that bring to a traditionally male genre like a western? Campion, who is now the first woman to be nominated for two best director Oscars, isn't sure. 
""It's so hard to know how much to believe in the female gaze or the male gaze,"" she tells the BBC. ""I think, to me, it's really the artist's gaze, bringing your sensitivity to the story. [But] I really wanted to have a woman cinematographer on this film, because there's so many other men and I really like to support women.""
Benedict Cumberbatch is one of the favourites for best actor at next month's Oscars
Wegner, who previously worked with Campion on a commercial, told the BBC's culture editor Katie Razzall: ""There probably is a gender element to it, but it's also just what interests you, what your upbringing is, what you notice. 
""And I think maybe Jane and I are similar in that way, really fascinated by subtle kinds of energy between people and what's not being said.""
Campion says it's thanks to the film's ""feminist"" producer Roger Frappier that she got on board with the project in the first place after a meeting in Cannes.
""It's very lucky that he really trusted me with this story, which you would think is a book for the kind of big-guy type of person that would handle ranch material - even though I do ride horses, and my parents did have cattle on the farm (Campion grew up in New Zealand).
""I was grateful to him for believing in me. And I was grateful to Savage's book, which is kind of subversive... when you think about most western genre movies, they're really a kind of celebration of masculinity in one way or another... and often a romanticised version of what a man is.
""In Savage's hands, he ripped through it really, and showed us a very true and different version.""
Wegner and Campion spent a year prepping for the film - usually it's a few weeks
His version is one Campion and Cumberbatch have faithfully brought to life on screen through the latter's swaggering, snarling and insidious presence. 
The film also stars real-life couple Jesse Plemons and Kirsten Dunst as Phil's brother and his wife Rose, who is also Pete's mother.
The film is Campion's first in more than a decade and has been largely well received by critics, with The Guardian's Peter Bradshaw, external describing it as ""one of Campion's best"" and Empire's Beth Webb, external noting that while the ""narrative here feels somewhat underdeveloped... Campion remains a master of sensory storytelling"".
The Netflix film is another feather in the streaming giant's cap, but Cumberbatch recently told Vanity Fair he wished the film had enjoyed a longer cinema release, external (it had a finite two-week run before it headed exclusively to Netflix).
Campion concurs.
""I'd have loved it to have been out in the cinema for longer but that wasn't the plan that Netflix had. However, I would have to say that we wouldn't have made the film at all without Netflix. They were the only people that were willing to pay what this film cost to make and they are incredibly supportive.""
The power of the Dog premiered at the Venice Film Festival, where Campion won the Silver Bear
She adds that Netflix are now putting the film out in cinemas again ""because of the 12 nominations that we got and you know, the general interest in it and people wanting to see it on a big screen"".
Campion also points out that streaming brings the film - which is essentially an arthouse one - to a bigger and wider audience, making it more accessible.  And she's delighted with the attention it's getting, including the awards buzz.
""I'm kind of thrilled. I feel like I've had kind of a comeback. I do feel really quite moved. People in the Academy have voted for so many categories.""
She also understands it has greater significance for women in the industry as a whole after the shocking revelations about the abuse of women in Hollywood including the Harvey Weinstein scandal.
""I really feel that the MeToo movement changed everything. I think it was a very dark time in the late 90s. And up to about 2015. It was almost as if nobody was hearing the fact there was such a depth of inequality. 
""And when those brave ladies shared their stories... everybody woke up and went: 'It's really been impossible, and it's incredibly unequal, and we're not going to have it.' 
""It's just not OK to have so little representation of women in film and TV. I think women are doing so well. It's no longer charitable to be employing women. And that's the big change. We want to be recognised because we are really good!""
The film was shot in New Zealand
Wegner is also blazing a trail on the awards circuit. As well as the Oscar nomination, she is the first woman ever to receive a Bafta nod for best cinematography.
""I think the visibility really matters because everyone's the harshest critic of their own work, but it is something very meaningful to be recognised by your peers,"" she told Razzall.
The Australian says she was ""so naïve"" when she first decided to go into her field.
""I had no idea that it was not a job that women usually did. It wasn't really until later in film school that I heard this term female cinematographer. And it slowly dawned on me that there were very few but... it was too late. I'd already decided [my career].""
The most recent annual Celluloid Ceiling report, external found that women comprised 21% of all directors, writers, producers, executive producers, editors and cinematographers working on the top 100 grossing films in 2020, up from 20% in 2019. Women also make up 50%, external of movie-goers.
Campion says: ""We just have to keep going this way. It can never go back to what it was. It was a really dark time when people didn't want to see what women thought or made films about but now there's a real appetite amongst audiences, men and women. 
""Netflix are actively seeking to keep their ratio of material made by women up. It's acts like that that make a real difference. 
""And hiring Ari for an ambitious film like this one. Is that a risk? Well, I don't think it was a risk. She's really talented. All she needed was people that believe in her and to give her that opportunity, supporting her to make sure she does succeed. And she did succeed. Brilliantly.""

41,41,BBC Ukrainian editor: 'My mother called to say she'd managed to buy bread',"Sun, 06 Mar 2022 01:02:02 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-60633888,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-60633888?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,"In the second week of war, the BBC's Ukrainian editor says empty shelves are an increasing reality.","BBC Ukrainian editor: 'My mother called to say she'd managed to buy bread'
We are now well into the second week of this war, and I've noticed that I don't cry any more.
I start the day reading the overnight news, counting new blasts all around Ukraine. A couple of days ago, I woke up to reports of major rocket strikes in Kyiv, near where my dad lives. It took me 10 minutes to pluck up the courage to call him, to ask if he and his partner were all right. They were, and I experienced a wave of relief.
When I see horrible pictures of destruction in Kyiv, and Russian tanks in towns and villages just outside, I think of these once-quiet places, where our friends have their dachas, or country cottages. We used to visit them with our kids, we had barbecues, and sipped wine in cosy armchairs. Some of those towns have now been destroyed by heavy fighting and artillery.
At the start of the war, one thing that did bring tears to my eyes was a message on an app for events in Kyiv. It was a list of things that would not happen that day - concerts and exhibitions, events that now seem like something from a previous life. These apps now provide different kinds of information - notifications about air raids, lists of supermarkets with food and pharmacies with medicine. 
Marta Shokalo on fleeing Kyiv
Marta Shokalo on the day Russia invaded 
My mother is more worried about how to get food for her dog and cats than for herself, but she called me the other day just to happily announce that she had managed to buy two loaves of bread! This is in a city where food used to be available in great abundance. 
That is more shocking for me than pictures of burned-out Russian tanks. Food shortages and empty shelves are our reality now. People share information on where you can buy and what. Some shops have shortages, but at the same time there is always enough for those who are in need. Restaurants prepare free food for soldiers, people who lost their homes or anyone who needs it.
People in Kyiv wait in line to go food shopping
My 10-year-old son is not going to school, even online. Some teachers have stayed in Kyiv, others have left. His classmates have fled to the countryside or abroad. They chat on Zoom, playing games and pretending to be hackers who fight for Ukraine. One of the chats they have set up on a messaging app is called ""war matters"".
Every day, Ukrainians face the decision of whether to stay or to leave. 
During the first week of war, almost a million packed their bags and left Ukraine to become refugees. That number is rising fast. But many others have decided to stay, at least for now. Famous singers, artists and sportsmen have enrolled in the army. Millions of Ukrainians have become volunteers, trying to help those in greatest need.
It feels like Ukrainians have become one big family where every member is trying to help, in any way they can. Those who can fight, fight. Those who can cook, cook. Those who can deliver, deliver. I heard a heart-breaking story from Kherson, the first city seized by Russian forces, where an elderly man without legs and fingers became a volunteer.
Now every town and village has checkpoints, made of sandbags, cement blocks and cut trees. Armed men - young professionals who fled Kyiv, local farmers or pensioners - check the documents of anyone entering. 
The village where I am staying has two checkpoints, manned by local men who take turns to operate them 24 hours a day. They have hunting rifles, and some carry knives or axes. They are ready to protect their small communities with everything they have. 
This sense of unity has never been so strong among Ukrainians. The country is full of activity like a beehive, producing hope for victory.

42,42,War in Ukraine: Russian invasion fuels Finnish support for Nato,"Sun, 06 Mar 2022 02:10:21 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-60626536,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-60626536?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,President Putin's devastating attack on Ukraine leaves countries in the region worried about their future.,"War in Ukraine: Russian invasion fuels Finnish support for Nato
Russia's devastating attack on Ukraine has left countries in the region concerned about the future
Russia's invasion of Ukraine has sent shivers of fear through many of its neighbours - from the Baltic states to Moldova. 
Finland ought theoretically to be safe, since it has historically been neutral and gave Stalin's Soviet army a hard time when he invaded the country in 1939.
There has never been much support here to join the Nato military alliance. But when the spokeswoman for the Russian foreign ministry recently warned Finland and Sweden explicitly that any move towards Nato could have military consequences, people in both countries were deeply shocked.
Since then, Russian warplanes have blatantly intruded into Swedish airspace.
If being neutral is not sufficient to guard against Russia, people here are saying that maybe joining Nato will give the two countries the protection they need. 
This represents a major change of mood. In Finland, particularly, relations with Russia were thought to be pretty good. 
The Ukraine invasion has changed everything.

LIVE: Latest updates from on the ground
THE BASICS: Why is Putin invading Ukraine?
SCENARIOS: Five ways the war in Ukraine might end
INNER CIRCLE: Who's in Putin's entourage, running the war? 
IN DEPTH: Full coverage of the conflict
A few days before the Russian troops moved in, Aleksi Salonen and Sampo Muhonen, a couple of geeks - their own description of themselves - were sitting in a Helsinki flat gaming. During a pause, they started talking about the growing threat from Russia, and agreed that it would be safer for Finland to apply for Nato membership.
They mentioned the idea to three friends online, and between them the five cooked up a plan to collect signatures for a petition to the Finnish parliament.  
In order to launch a debate by MPs, a proposal has to have 50,000 signatures. Within 10 days they had reached 70,000. 
They had touched a nerve in the Finnish population, and now the matter will be put to the government. The latest opinion polls indicate that a majority of people support the idea.
Finland is a cautious country, and its government is particularly so. When I asked Defence Minister Antti Kaikkonen for his views, he was careful not to give an answer. He acknowledged the situation was difficult, but said that joining Nato was something that required very careful consideration.
Perhaps the Finnish government wants to see what happens in Ukraine before it makes up its mind. Clearly the Russians won't invade another country when their hands are full with the fighting in Ukraine.
Last week, Finnish President Sauli Niinisto discussed strengthening security ties with US President Joe Biden
Viewed from Finland, there are some striking similarities between the attack on Ukraine and the invasion of Finland in 1939 - the Winter War, as it's known.  
Joseph Stalin, full of self-confidence, sent his army into Finland only to find that its resistance was far greater than his generals had assured him. The Finns staged a largely guerrilla war against an army which was huge, but whose morale had been seriously damaged by the treason trials of a year or so earlier, in which the majority of the most senior figures were purged and executed.
The Winter War dragged on for months before negotiations finally began and an agreement was reached. Russia took some territory from Finland, but the Finns kept their independence - and have done so ever since.
The invasion of Ukraine has similarly been mismanaged. The logistical side was botched from the start, with too little fuel, food and water supplied to the troops - many of whom had been assured they were only carrying out an exercise. 
Western analysts say even maps were in short supply, with tank drivers often having to stop to get directions. This was not by any means a Blitzkrieg, and the prerequisite for any modern war - the destruction of the enemy's communications - simply never happened.
None of this means that President Vladimir Putin won't win in the end. 
He has already assured France's President Macron that he will go on until he takes the whole of Ukraine. The danger is that if he cannot do it with his conventional forces, the temptation will be strong to use his tactical nuclear weapons to force Ukraine to surrender. 
Russian nuclear theory seems to regard this as an acceptable risk; Western experts are much more worried by the possibilities. There can be no certainties if that threshold is crossed.
Russia claims to have invaded Ukraine because it wanted to save the Ukrainian people from neo-fascism. What President Putin really seems to want to ensure - apart from avenging what he sees as Ukraine's treachery in breaking away from Russia - is that there is no question of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky joining Nato.
In fact, that genuinely doesn't seem to have been a possibility within the foreseeable future. 
But there is a real irony in the fact that the war in Ukraine now seems to be giving Finland - and perhaps Sweden - real cause for considering whether they should join the Western military alliance.

43,43,Identity: What does it mean to be Welsh?,"Sun, 06 Mar 2022 08:10:02 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-60590685,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-60590685?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,"Two writers on being Welsh when your appearance does not ""match an accepted aesthetic of Welshness"".","Identity: What does it mean to be Welsh?
Two writers share their experiences of being Welsh when your appearance ""does not match an accepted aesthetic of Welshness""
Rugby, rolling hills, castles, coal and choirs - these are some of the images often associated with Wales and the Welsh.
But what are the experiences of Welsh people who have plural ethnic and cultural identities?
What preconceptions might a black child face in rural Powys or a hijab-wearing Muslim face in Cardiff? 
Welshness should be seen as ""a spectrum rather than a hierarchy... a patchwork quilt"", said writer Hanan Issa.
She is one of a number of contributors to book Welsh Plural, a collection of essays ""on the future of Wales"" that offers ""imaginative, radical perspectives that take us beyond the clichés and binaries that so often shape thinking about Wales and Welshness"".  
Writer Kandace Siobhan Walker and her family moved to the Brecon Beacons when she was a child
Writer and filmmaker Kandace Siobhan Walker, 27, said when she and her family moved from east London to Brecon Beacons National Park, Powys, in 2003 they were ""poster children for multiculturalism, for globalisation"".
From the age of nine until she left for university at 18, home was a remote house at the end of a bridleway.
She said it was difficult finding anyone who knew how to work with afro-textured hair so a hairdresser from over the border in Hereford would travel to see the family at home, her mother, who remains in the family home, found a man in Bristol who could order in Jamaican ingredients, and finding somewhere that stocked her favourite Caribbean drink sarsaparilla was a regular mission. 
Kandace and her family, pictured in 2003, shortly after their move to Wales
'Why is she here?'
In her essay, Lights in the Dark: Notes towards a personal history of Wales in the 21st Century, Kandace writes about being ""tolerated nowhere, questioned everywhere"".
Asked about what experiences led her to write those words, she recalled a time when she was 14 and a woman stopped her in a supermarket carpark. 
Afro hair discrimination should be treated as racism, say MPs
Black and multi-racial business owners on the hurdles they face
BBC Wales hasn't made enough progress on diversity, says director
""She asked me what tribe I was, I was like, 'what you're talking about?',"" she said.
She said hikers were often surprised to see a young black girl in the rural Welsh hills: ""Even if I was just in my own garden, walkers would be thinking I'm another walker - and I'm like, 'I'm in a dressing gown'.
""There's that implicit idea, 'why is she here?'""
Writer Kandace Siobhan Walker says she has hope and pride in Wales and Welsh culture
'Where are you from?
She also writes about the ""everyday dispossession"" of white strangers asking 'where are you from?' - ""a classic"".
""It's a very loaded question and I think people know that,"" she explained. 
""'You come from somewhere else, maybe your family comes from somewhere else, or like your ancestors do' they know that history is fraught and so it feels often quite entitled... 'what trauma do you come from? Like, what's gone on there?'""
She said by the time she got into her 20s she started simply saying, 'I'm from here'. 
""I don't want to get into it with strangers usually.""
Kandace Siobhan Walker says white walkers would often assume she did not live in the rural Brecon Beacons
She said when a black person asks the same question ""it's almost always a completely different conversation because they're going to tell me where they're from"".
""It's more like an excitement, we're going to compare, take out our little family histories and be like 'look how kind of similar bit different they are'."" 
She said white people who ask her where she is from have usually ""decided their history is kind of ubiquitous and uninteresting that they don't need to explain themselves to me"".
Kandace, who now lives in south London, said she wrote her contribution to the book at a time when she was thinking more about ""purposely identifying as Welsh"" and ""who decides that"".
Kandace Siobhan Walker lived in Wales between the ages of nine and 18
""What happens if I start telling people I'm Welsh and just letting them argue it out for themselves,"" she said. 
She said for a long time she was ""trying to let it not matter too much where I came from, or who I came from in terms of people - but eventually I just realised it was such an integral part of my life - my dad's family are African American and my mum's family are Jamaican Canadian...
""We moved to London but then moved to Wales so we've never fitted into a specific like pattern or group in terms of eras of migration.""
She said through her writing she had realised ""how much it meant to me to have grown up in Wales and be Welsh"".
""I think Wales is just a fundamentally plural place, a place built on pluralities in its history and its culture and its language,"" she said.
""Despite kind of negative experiences I've had growing up, or even now, I always have hope and quite a lot of pride in Wales and Welsh culture.""
Writer Hanan Issa says people's perception of Welshness is too narrow
Writer Hanan Issa, 35, from Cardiff, said is was a discussion about the ""frustrations of how narrow the perception of Welshness is"" at the Hay Festival with three other Welsh writers that eventually led them to work on the book.
She said she had always had a ""plural perception of identity"". 
""I'm mixed race, I've got Welsh heritage and Iraqi heritage,"" she said. 
She said people had sometimes assumed she was not Welsh because of her appearance.
""Not so much recently, but you know I have had experiences where people will say things like 'oh your English is very good'.
""It doesn't work, this idea that you have to look Welsh.""
In her essay - Have you heard the one about the niqabi on a bus? - she recalls times people have ""faced abuse because their outward appearance doesn't align with people's perception of Welshness"".
She writes about the time her white mother, who was wearing a niqab, was abused by a man in Cardiff indoor market.
""Looming over her, he shouted in a Cockney accent, 'Why don't you go back to your own country'.
""Without missing a beat my little nan squared up to this bully saying, 'she's my daughter and she's Welsh but you are not. Why don't you do us a favour and go back to your country?'""
She concludes the anecdote: ""While it is a story of triumph, Nan's defence relied on my mum's white Welshness to emphasise her right to belong here.""
Hanan says some people have sometimes assumed she is not Welsh
Hanan said there was a ""very strange, luminous space between being seen as something foreign but having all these experiences that were very Welsh"".
So, what does it mean to be Welsh?
Hanan said an integral part of Islamic faith is ""khalifah"", meaning caretaker.
She wrote: ""Perhaps Wales and Welshness belongs to all those who care for her and the people who call her home.""

44,44,Why Indian fathers are embracing paternity leave,"Sun, 06 Mar 2022 00:37:57 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-60491095,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-60491095?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,The pandemic and changing family structures have highlighted how young parents are struggling with childcare.,"Why Indian fathers are embracing paternity leave
Twitter chief executive Parag Agrawal said last month he would take time off for his second child's birth
It really does take a village to raise a child and Rehan Khan, 35, will tell you it doesn't get easier or less chaotic with time or experience.
A marketing manager based in the southern Indian city of Bangalore, Mr Khan welcomed his third child during the lockdown in 2020.
This time, his parenting experience was markedly different. The tech company he works with had increased paternity leave from one to three weeks. His wife, a contract worker for a US-based tech company, was able to take 15 weeks of leave.
The first month was tough, Mr Khan said, as sleep patterns changed and the baby needed constant attention.
""My wife would be with the baby until 03:30 and then I would take over. Carry him around, play with him, rock him,"" he said.
But it helped that both he and his wife worked from home, his parents stayed with them to help and they were financially well off enough to move into a bigger apartment.
Paternity leave: The hidden barriers keeping men at work
Mr Khan called the experience ""blissful"" but was quick to point out that stories like his were rare and one of privilege - as few Indian companies worked around a couple's childcare needs.
""I am very lucky to have a manager who's not an Indian, and his boss is American. It makes a difference because they are much more sensitive about this,"" he said.
India's federal and most state governments allow married male employees to take a fortnight's leave at the time of, or within six months after, the birth of a child.
Himanshu Dhanda feels a month of paid leave would help fathers a lot
In comparison, Indian women working in state-run and private companies are entitled to 26 weeks of paid leave, one of the longest in the world. But there is still no nationwide policy for paternity leave.
Some private companies have begun to offer paternity leave for fathers, adoptive parents and LGBT couples. Tech companies give a decent amount of paternity leave to help them recruit and retain talent. Drinks giant Diageo allows all eligible employees a 26-week parental leave irrespective of gender or sexual orientation.
Last month India-born Twitter chief executive Parag Agrawal's announcement that he would take a few weeks off after the birth of his second child had Indians talking about paternity leave. Indian tech companies and start-ups that offered generous leaves highlighted their policies.
In India, joint families - where multiple generations form one household - have played a significant part in childcare. But this is slowly changing with more children being born in nuclear families.
Will new maternity law help keep Indian women in work?
Himanshu Dhanda, a federal government worker, said a cultural shift was visible in his current workplace where senior male colleagues called him ""lucky"" for being able to take leave for his child's birth which they said wasn't available in their time.
Mr Dhanda's father, a retired government employee, had been mocked for trying to take paternity leave three decades ago. ""He told me his colleagues said, 'It's the mother who'll feed the child. What is your work there?'"" Mr Dhanda recounted. His father was able to take just seven days.
Mr Dhanda said that a month of paid leave for fathers would help a lot. ""Especially with people like us who have no experience, it is very challenging. A lot of unexpected things happen. You are just running around figuring things out like the baby's sleep, the mother's physical and emotional health,"" he said.
Sreeparna Chattopadhyay, an associate professor of sociology at Pune's Flame University, believes India should have a statutory shared parental leave policy, similar to Sweden's, which would be completely inclusive and not limited to biological parents.
""If you don't have something enshrined in a statutory way, then there is really no obligation to carry it out, right? And [with its current policy] the state is signalling in some way that they care about the fact that parenting is a shared responsibility,"" she said.

United were completely outclassed, only forcing Ederson into one save, and could have lost by more - Phil Foden hitting the post with one of their many chances. 
Former United goalkeeper Schmeichel, who also played for City, was watching the game for BBC Radio 5 Live and said: ""I thought Rangnick should have changed things at half-time. He may have had words, but the second half was worse. At no point were United in the game apart from on the scoreline. 
""Far too many players are either not good enough, or don't care enough. Having an interim manager means he can't do much. He knows he's not going to be there, so what can he change?
""Manchester City were majestic, but they haven't had to work that hard for it and I think that will hurt United most.""

It's not a surprise that Man City are top of the league - Rangnick
Schmeichel's former United team-mates Roy Keane and Gary Neville went further on Sky Sports.
Keane said: ""United gave up and in a derby, in any game, it's unforgivable.
""I can forgive mistakes, but not running back, not trying to tackle - there are players out there who shouldn't play for Manchester United again.
""We've all lost football matches but it's the way they lost. You expect them to play with a bit of pride but that's a reflection of where the team is at the moment.
""If you can't run back and put your body on the line when you're playing for Manchester United, it's shameful.""
He also accused midfielder Fred of ""looking like he was waiting for a bus instead of going for the ball"" before De Bruyne's second.
Keane continued: ""Who's running that dressing room? These guys seem more bothered about, 'how am I looking? How's my hair looking? Are my boots nice?' You leave your ego at the door when you play for United.""
Harry Maguire (l) was given an average rating of 2.19 by BBC Sport readers
'We have a long way to go to close the gap'
The Red Devils did not have a shot in the second half and are outside the Champions League places, a point behind Arsenal having played three games more.
And Neville reserved his most forceful criticism for how United finished the game, labelling the final 25 minutes a ""disgrace"".
""After the third goal went in, City had 92% possession,"" he said. ""That's unprecedented, that's unheard of and it's unforgiveable.
""The dressing room isn't broken, but it isn't far off. You find out what it's like when the going gets tough and a lot of them went missing.""
BBC pundit Chris Sutton said United were ""embarrassed"" by their city rivals.
Rangnick has won only eight of his 18 games in interim charge, with a permanent successor for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer likely to be named this summer.
""It is a difficult game that shows we have a long way to go to close that gap,"" said Rangnick.
""Everyone knows how good they [City] are. They are one of the top teams in the world and there is a gap between the two teams.""
Liverpool are six points behind City now and ex-Reds midfielder Jamie Redknapp suggested his old side would be angry with what he saw as United's lack of fight.
""Manchester City have created a team and thought about the players to make it. United have thrown money at the team and hoped to find a team. It's not working,"" he said.
""It takes time and it takes the right culture but at the moment United are a million miles off. If I was [Liverpool manager] Jurgen Klopp watching that I'd be fuming.
""United didn't even try. There was no idea and no structure.""
'One of highest levels we have played at'

Man City 4-1 Man Utd: Pep Guardiola says his side were excellent throughout
Meanwhile, Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola said: ""The second half was one of the highest levels we have played at in years.
""I'm not from Manchester, but I know what it means to our fans to win the derby. We should have scored more goals.""
He also admitted that United had caused his team problems in the first half. 
""It was so aggressive, the mentality for Ralf,"" he said. ""Without Cristiano [Ronaldo] they can do it [press aggressively]. We struggled to make it up. The first half we had more chances on the counter attack. 
""In the second, Bernardo [Silva] was more involved, the movement from everyone was excellent and we played really good. Our decision making during the game was good and that's why we won the game.""
Mahrez, who scored twice, told the BBC: ""We totally controlled the second half. When we are like that, it is difficult to take us. We have confidence in our football, but we are taking it game by game.""

England seam bowler Ollie Robinson has been ruled out of the first Test against West Indies with a back injury.
Robinson, 28, left the field because of a back spasm on the third morning of England's warm-up against a Cricket West Indies President's XI in Antigua.
He did not return to bowl on the fourth and final day on Friday and will now miss the first Test in Antigua, which starts on Tuesday.
Saqib Mahmood has taken Robinson's spot in a 12-man England squad.
England's likely seam attack for the first Test will be Mark Wood, Chris Woakes and Craig Overton, but Lancashire's uncapped Mahmood could be chosen for the fourth bowler spot in place of Jack Leach's left-arm spin.
England's final team will be confirmed at the toss on Tuesday.
""Ollie is a talented bowler. Naturally he'll be a big miss,"" said Woakes.
""He's shown in his short Test career so far that he's certainly got the skills and the ability to do good things in the format. At the same time, it gives people opportunities.
England in the West Indies - schedule
""We're trying to win games cricket here, but it does give that chance to someone to potentially make their Test debut who's been waiting in the wings for quite a while to show what they can can do at this level.""
England dropped James Anderson and Stuart Broad, their top two leading Test wicket-takers, for the West Indies tour, with Robinson set to be a key part of the attack in their absence.
Neither Anderson, 39, nor Broad, 35, are expected to join the squad if Robinson is ruled out of the series, with Warwickshire seamer Liam Norwell, 30, the first reserve.
Full squad
Joe Root (captain), Jonny Bairstow, Zak Crawley, Ben Foakes (wicketkeeper), Dan Lawrence, Jack Leach, Alex Lees, Saqib Mahmood, Craig Overton, Ben Stokes, Chris Woakes, Mark Wood

Who could play until he's 40? And who is back to their best? Find out in Garth Crooks' latest Team of the Week.,"Garth Crooks' Team of the Week: Coutinho, De Bruyne, Havertz, Saka
Premier League leaders Manchester City responded to Liverpool's victory over West Ham by thrashing derby rivals Manchester United on Sunday.
Pep Guardiola's defending champions recorded a 4-1 home win to go six points clear at the top, after Jurgen Klopp's side continued their title challenge with a 1-0 win on Saturday.
Arsenal beat Watford 3-1 to move into fourth place while Chelsea maintained their grip on third by beating Burnley 4-0.
Newcastle eased their relegation concerns with a 2-1 win over Brighton, as did Brentford with a 3-1 win at Norwich City, but Leeds United could not improve their situation as manager Jesse Marsch's first game ended in a 1-0 defeat by Leicester City.
Elsewhere, Aston Villa recorded an emphatic 4-0 victory against Southampton, and Crystal Palace beat Wolves 2-0.
But what you want to know is: who made my Team of the Week? Check it out below and then make your own selections at the bottom of the article.
Goalkeeper - Kasper Schmeichel (Leicester City)
Kasper Schmeichel's save from Jack Harrison was decent, and the other from Daniel James was better, but the stop with his legs from Raphinha, who had the goal at his mercy with the keeper on the ground, was not only brilliant but a game-changer. 
Schmeichel's performance against a rejuvenated Leeds was crucial. Leicester's form has been erratic recently while Leeds, under new management, were in the mood to prove a point.
Sadly their finishing wasn't up to it. I do wonder what Don Revie and Billy Bremner would have said about an American managing Leeds United in the top flight, in what is rapidly becoming a relegation battle.  
Did you know? Leicester City registered back-to-back clean sheets for the first time since February 2021.
Defenders - Fabian Schar (Newcastle United), Thiago Silva (Chelsea), Joao Cancelo (Manchester City)
Fabian Schar: Last week Fabian Schar was making goals, this week he's scoring them. It was great movement and a brilliant header and the Magpies are flying. 
It's the second consecutive time that Schar has made my team of the week and if he keeps on playing like this he might make my team of the season. 
It's not that long ago Newcastle were in the bottom three and fighting for their lives. I don't know who is advising the new owners but they have got all the major decisions absolutely spot on since their arrival at St James' Park. As for Eddie Howe, he must be a candidate for manager of the season.  
Did you know? No team is on a longer unbeaten run in the Premier League than Newcastle, who are without defeat in their past eight games in the competition.
Thiago Silva: Aaron Lennon had done brilliantly to get to the byline and pull the ball back for Wout Weghorst but the Burnley centre-forward's shot was kicked off the line by Thiago Silva. 
The defender's positioning on the goalline was absolutely perfect. Not only did he save Edouard Mendy, who looked like he had been caught out of position, but he enabled Chelsea to keep a clean sheet. 
Whoever's idea it was to bring Silva to Chelsea is a genius. The man is 37 years of age and looks like he could play in the Premier League until he's 40.
Did you know? Chelsea have won their past three Premier League games, having won just three of their previous 11 in the competition prior to this run.
Joao Cancelo: The tackle on Anthony Elanga in the second half as the game was starting to get interesting was emphatic. For a defender who doesn't know a great deal about Manchester derbies, Joao Cancelo certainly let Elanga know he was in a game. 
If Aaron Wan-Bissaka was having trouble down their right side with Phil Foden, then Cancelo had Elanga in his pocket. 
Big games require big players but I was alarmed by Paul Pogba's poor contribution in this one. If ever a fixture was made for him, this was it - and he allowed it to just pass him by.  
Did you know? Manchester City completed the league double over Manchester United for the fifth time - and first since 2018-19.
Midfielders - Reece James (Chelsea), Philippe Coutinho (Aston Villa), Kevin de Bruyne (Manchester City), Riyad Mahrez (Manchester City)
Reece James: The return of Reece James to Chelsea's starting line-up was telling. Thomas Tuchel left the England international out of the starting line-up against Liverpool in the Carabao Cup final and Chelsea suffered for it. 
Goals are invaluable in any team and when you replace goalscorers with caution it can be costly. James' return on Chelsea's right-hand side for the injured Cesar Azpilicueta against Burnley paid off in a major way. 
James might not be as good in defence as the Spaniard but he gives you much more going forward. His second-half finish and assist for Kai Havertz set the tone for an excellent away win.   
Did you know? With five goals and six assists, Reece James is one of three English players to register both at least five goals and five assists in the Premier League this season - along with Jarrod Bowen and Mason Mount.
Philippe Coutinho: Villa Park is buzzing again and it's all down to Philippe Coutinho. When Steven Gerrard landed the services of the Brazilian he did say that once the player was fully fit he would play a major part in Villa's progression and that seems to be the case.
Coutinho is making players play all over the pitch. Why his move to Barcelona didn't work out is hard to fathom but I haven't seen a player have such an impact on a Villa team since Jack Grealish.
It looks like Coutinho has well and truly replaced Grealish - and at a fraction of the cost. Coutinho for Grealish looks like good business done by Villa. 
Did you know? Philippe Coutinho has been involved in six goals in four home Premier League games for Aston Villa. He has both scored and assisted in three of his last six home appearances in the competition in all.
Kevin de Bruyne: His first goal was put away with consummate ease, while his second was tucked away with the authority of a player with one hand on the Premier League title and no intention of letting go of it. 
De Bruyne led his team on to the pitch with the colours of Ukraine draped around their shoulders in an impressive show of solidarity. 
I don't know if he or his team-mates were inspired by that but they certainly played like it. De Bruyne is back to his best and with him in this mood I wouldn't bet against City winning the title if he can remain fit.    
Did you know? Kevin de Bruyne is the fourth Manchester City player to score twice against Manchester United in a home Premier League game after Niall Quinn (1993), Shaun Goater (2002) and Sergio Aguero (2013).
Riyad Mahrez: Manchester United had every reason to walk off the pitch at the end of this Manchester derby looking utterly dejected, having been on the receiving end of real mauling. The Etihad Stadium, on the other hand, was jumping due to City's sheer superiority. 
Riyad Mahrez struck two of the sweetest strikes you will ever see. City might be six points clear at the top of the table but Liverpool have a game in hand and the slightest slip would let them in. 
Liverpool don't play the quality of football City do but that won't stop them from getting their hands on the title given the opportunity.
Did you know? Only Mohamed Salah (27) has scored more goals in all competitions this season than Riyad Mahrez (21) among Premier League players.
Forwards - Ivan Toney (Brentford), Kai Havertz (Chelsea), Bukayo Saka (Arsenal)
Ivan Toney: He had a bit of a barren spell followed by injury recently but Ivan Toney came back with an impressive hat-trick against a Norwich side who have lost that little bit of fizz which Dean Smith's arrival brought to the club.
This was a massive away win for Brentford and could be a turning point in their season. I was a little concerned that the west London club could get sucked into a relegation fight but so far they have kept themselves out of the bottom three and in a place of relative safety. 
A punter recently asked me if I thought Brentford would stay up and I said I wasn't sure. I'm much more confident now.
Did you know? Ivan Toney has scored all 16 of the penalties he has taken for Brentford in all competitions. Saturday's match was the second time he has converted two spot-kicks in a single game for the club.
Kai Havertz: To say Kai Havertz has found his feet at Chelsea would be an understatement. The German striker is not only scoring goals but playing brilliantly. 
It has taken him a while to settle in but he has certainly got there, which is just as well as Stamford Bridge can be a graveyard for strikers. 
Romelu Lukaku, a centre forward who is currently out of favour and low in confidence, needs to be playing regularly to produce his best. Timo Werner is also struggling, so to have Havertz in this rich vein of form is crucial for the Blues. 
Did you know? No Chelsea player has scored more goals under Thomas Tuchel in all competitions than Kai Havertz (13), who scored twice in a Premier League game for the first time since May 2021.
Bukayo Saka: If you're a Tottenham fan it must be excruciating watching your local rivals continue to pick up points as they aim to secure a Champions League spot.
Arsenal's most recent performance against Watford was enough to win all three points but they still show signs of frailty at the back. The reason the Gunners are still flirting with a top-four place is due largely to the brilliance of Bukayo Saka. 
The England international has grown tremendously since he played in the European championships and seems to glide through games these days. If Arsenal can't provide Champions League football for the youngster then I suggest he finds it somewhere else. Talent like this shouldn't hang around.     
Did you know? Bukayo Saka has been involved in 13 goals in the Premier League this season, which is more than any other player aged under 21 (eight goals, five assists).
The Crooks of the Matter
The image of Thomas Tuchel raising his voice and glaring at a reporter in response to the barrage of questions regarding the future of Roman Abramovich at Chelsea made it clear: the news conference was having a profound effect on the manager. 
Chelsea's owner and his alleged association with Vladimir Putin had become a focal point the media was not prepared to ignore. If it was having this impact on the manager, you can be certain it was having an impact on his players. 
The situation surrounding Chelsea Football Club and its owner had become unmanageable. Shortly before their FA Cup fifth-round tie against Luton Town a statement was released confirming the club was to be sold. Tuchel answered questions about the owner's decision in his post-match interview with a great deal more composure than he did days before, as though it had somehow lanced the boil.
Nevertheless, throughout all this tension, I can't help think that the attention on Abramovich wouldn't have been half as acute had he immediately condemned Russia's invasion of Ukraine. 
The mere fact that the Chelsea owner still hasn't roundly criticised the actions taken by his president presents members of parliament with a very big stick to beat him with. What has also become abundantly clear this week is neither the club nor Abramovich could take the pain any longer - hence the statement.   
So what is the future for Chelsea? The club is a million miles away from the days under Ken Bates. Buying Chelsea is one thing but who has the disposable income to chase the sort of trophies Abramovich was chasing? 
The west London club have acquired a lifestyle they may no longer be in a position to afford. It's not the end of the world but it might take some getting used to.

48,48,Welsh Open: Joe Perry beats Judd Trump to win title,"Sun, 06 Mar 2022 21:55:52 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/snooker/60632805,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/snooker/60632805?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,Joe Perry beats Judd Trump 9-5 to win the Welsh Open title for the first time at Celtic Manor Resort in Newport.,"Welsh Open: Joe Perry beats Judd Trump to win title
Joe Perry had never gone further than the semi-final stage at the Welsh Open before 2022
World number 42 Joe Perry has won the Welsh Open for the first time, beating world number three Judd Trump 9-5 in the final in Newport. 
It is Perry's second ranking title, his last was back in 2015.
With the win Perry, who turned professional in 1992, now jumps up to 23rd in the world.
""This is the absolutely highlight of my career by a country mile,"" said the 47-year-old.
""I thought it was coming to an end but now I've had the best moment of my snooker career - to do it against a great champion like Trump is the icing on the cake.""
Perry had a difficult route to the final, beating seeds Mark Allen, Kyren Wilson, Ricky Walden and Jack Lisowski and came through three final frame deciders on his way to lift the Ray Reardon Trophy and claim the £70,000 first prize.
It was Perry's first ranking final since the 2018 European Masters and his first win on British soil in a major final.
""I can't believe it. I felt brilliant today and felt relaxed and calm, but for some reason kept missing easy balls.""
""Judd had an off day and let me off lightly today but I feel like I've played really well tonight,"" said Perry.
Level playing field
The opening session was nervy and tentative from both players, with the first ball potted in the opening frame being the cue ball. 
However, it soon developed into an exciting frame which came down to the black ball, with Cambridgeshire Perry winning it with a superb long range double shot.
The former world champion Trump took the next frame to level the match in only nine minutes but Perry took advantage of a loose safety shot from Trump to lead again at 2-1.
In the fourth frame Perry missed a red with the rest, which ultimately cost him the frame as Trump came to the table and cleared up to level again 2-2 at the first mid-session interval. 
Perry had chances to win the fifth frame with some great long pots, but Trump took advantage of an easy miss on the blue by Perry to take the lead for the first time at 3-2.
It was the former Masters finalist Perry who pinched the scrappy sixth frame with the blue to draw level, but a missed black in the seventh frame cost him the chance to regain his lead and Trump was back in front at 4-3.
An uncharacteristic missed pink proved costly for Trump in the next frame and Perry denied the former world number one the chance to lead 5-3, instead levelling it at 4-4 at the end of the afternoon session. 
Perry pulled ahead
Perry had a dream start in the first frame of the evening session, making a 108 break - the first century break of the final - and seemed to put down a marker.
There was a tense battle in the 11th frame and Trump made the most of a fluke to level it at 5-5. 
Trump missed a black off the spot on 17 points in the next frame and it was Perry who capitalised and took the lead once again, following up with a hard-won 68 break to extend his lead for the first time in the match with a two frame advantage at 7-5 at the mid-session interval. 
In the 12th frame Perry just missed a long black and Trump looked to close the gap, but he made more mistakes. Meanwhile Perry's confidence and composure grew - he potted a superb long red to the green pocket which enabled him to make the clearance, and he moved to one frame from the title.
The momentum was firmly with Perry and he made a 70 break in the next frame to seal the win.
""It was a tough game and Joe played the better of us from start to finish, and fair play to him,"" said Trump.
""He's one of the nicest guys on tour so everyone is very happy for him.
""I was digging in all day just trying to stay with him. There were a couple of chances where I missed easy balls in the middle of the match, but I gave it my all and it just wasn't to be really.
""Joe put me under pressure from the start and he is the best player over the week and thoroughly deserved to win,"" said Trump in his 34th ranking final.
Unusually for the former world champion, it has been a year since Trump last won a ranking event, the 2021 Gibraltar Open.

Fitzpatrick is competing at her second Games
Britain's Menna Fitzpatrick with guide Gary Smith and brothers Neil and Andrew Simpson have won their second medals at the Beijing Winter Paralympics.
The GB pairings finished third in their respective visually impaired super combined events.
Both pairs followed up their opening super-G runs with solid slalom displays to add to their medal tallies.

China continue domination with Para-snowboard success
Fitzpatrick and Smith, who won super-G silver on Sunday, were fifth after their opening super-G run on Monday.
But the 23-year-old, Britain's most decorated Winter Paralympian, put in the fastest slalom run of her competition to move up the leaderboard for a medal.
""We left ourselves a bit of work to do in the slalom,"" she said. ""The plan of going out there and putting down a pretty decent run paid off, so we are super, super happy.
""The confidence is really, really high - it was quite a tricky slalom set with tight turns and lots of combinations. It was tough but really good fun.""
The pair finished in two minutes 05.98 seconds with Slovakia's Henrieta Farkasova taking her second gold of the Games (2:03.39) and China's Zhu Daqing in silver (2:04.25) while Millie Knight and Brett Wild were fourth.
After their super-G gold, the Scottish brothers were also in fifth place at the halfway point of Monday's competition after an error.
The Simpson brothers will go again in Thursday's giant slalom
But in a keenly contested event, where the top five after the super-G were separated by 1.75 seconds, they also impressed in the slalom and when both fourth-placed Jakob Krako of Slovakia and halfway leader Hyacinthe Deleplace from France made errors, they secured a second medal in a time of 1:52.81.
Gold went to Italy's Giacomo Bertagnolli (1:49.80) with Austria's Johannes Aigner in silver (1:51.98).
""I think with the mistake in the first run, coming into the slalom we knew we had to charge, and we had nothing to lose going in to the second run,"" said Neil, 19.
""I skied a lot of slalom when I was younger as you have no choice growing up in Scotland and it's something I really enjoy. 
""I was so tired after the gold medal yesterday, I just had some food and went to bed so we were in the right mindset today.""
Of the other Britons, Shona Brownlee, who was fifth at halfway in the women's seated event, failed to finish her slalom run while James Whitley was disqualified in his super-G run.
Elsewhere, the GB wheelchair curlers had a mixed day, following up an easy win over Switzerland with a loss to Slovakia.
They needed just six of the scheduled eight ends of their match to beat the Swiss team 15-1 but slipped to a 7-3 defeat against Slovakia later in the day.
They are in a five-way tie for fourth place after the first four rounds of the competition.

50,50,'Man City prove a point to anyone who doubted them' - MOTD2 analysis,"Sun, 06 Mar 2022 22:30:32 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/60639745,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/60639745?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,MOTD2 pundit Danny Murphy feels Manchester City played like they had a point to prove against Manchester United and their second-half performance was an emphatic statement to anyone who doubted them.,"Man City 4-1 Man Utd: 'City prove a point to anyone who doubted them'
It looked like Manchester City felt they had a point to prove against Manchester United on Sunday and their second-half performance was an emphatic statement to anyone who doubted them.
This was a response I saw coming, too. City were always going to dip a little bit at some point this season because the standards they have set have been nothing short of amazing - it is credit to Liverpool that they are even still near the Premier League leaders after the run that Pep Guardiola's side were on until they lost to Tottenham two weeks ago.
So, after seeing City lose one game - in the last minute - to Spurs, and then scrape through against Everton with a bit of luck last weekend, it was no surprise to me to see them come out for a huge game like a Manchester derby and absolutely batter United, because that is what great teams do.
The way United collapsed at Etihad Stadium was unacceptable, and Ralf Rangnick's side deserve criticism for the way they finished the game, but you also have to recognise United were playing against a phenomenal City team that has some unbelievably talented players and also possesses an amazing work ethic too.
You cannot only play for half a game against City and United found that out, the hard way.

United start well - but finish badly
Man Utd's starting XI v Man City
I actually thought United did well for the first half-hour on Sunday.
They committed lots of men forward on the counter-attack and they even tried to win the ball back high up the pitch, which was quite impressive to watch.
It was a risky way of playing, but it was probably what United's fans wanted to see - their side having a go, and trying to be competitive in the game.
It worked - United caused City problems in that opening period, and had some decent chances.
Of course, when you take the game to City like that, their quality means you are going to give chances away yourself when they break through your lines.
As the first half wore on, City had more and more possession and were 2-1 up, but United still looked dangerous and were right in the game. It set us up for a great second half - but United just didn't turn up.

It's not a surprise that Man City are top of the league - Rangnick
One of the most disappointing things about their display after the break was their lack of concentration. It led to Riyad Mahrez scoring City's third goal, and it was the same with lots of other chances they gave away. Their players kept switching off at key times.
Even worse than that, though, was seeing their reaction after going 3-1 down. It seemed like they didn't have the desire or the fitness to get back into the game, or even have a go at City.
I don't know if that was down to complete fatigue because of who they were playing against, or if it was a demonstration of their lack of belief.
Either way, United didn't just lose the game, they capitulated. It looked like they realised they were done and, whatever the reason, had nothing more to give. Seeing that happen must be a real worry for Rangnick.
De Bruyne was a joy to watch
Man City's starting XI v Man Utd
Even before City scored their third and fourth goals, it felt like there was an inevitability about the result because of how dominant they had become.
It's hard to pick out individuals from a display like that because it was a collective effort from some wonderful players, and I loved how none of them ever stopped working.
Bernardo Silva and Rodri's work ethic in the middle of the pitch, to always get back and help their defenders, and then to also press and do all the other things you want from your midfielders, was just incredible.

Man City 4-1 Man Utd: Pep Guardiola says his side were excellent throughout
It was going forward where City were really impressive, though. I'm not surprised Guardiola praised Kevin de Bruyne afterwards, because he was at his absolute best and it was a joy to watch.
De Bruyne is like poetry in motion when he is on top of his game like that, and it is difficult to stop him however you are set up, especially when you have got the attacking players around him that City do.
Again, Silva contributed in that way too - he set up their first goal - while Jack Grealish looked full of confidence and Mahrez just came alive as the game went on. 
Phil Foden also impressed me, playing as a false nine, and demonstrated his ability to understand the game in that area of the pitch and make a real impact. 
It felt like Foden and De Bruyne were leading City's attack, and United could not cope with either of them.

'Foden sets the tempo' - how Man City 'steamrollered' Man Utd
A shock if Man Utd finish fourth
City now have 10 league games to go and we already know Liverpool are the only team that can stop them retaining their title.
We are all looking at 10 April, when Jurgen Klopp's side come to Etihad Stadium, and of course that will be a massive game between two fantastic teams who are going head to head again.
That's the big one, and I can't wait, but I just feel there will be some other twists and turns along the way as well.
Everyone expects both teams to win every other game apart from that one, when they play each other, but football is not like that, and it is going to be fascinating to see where they do drop points over the coming weeks.
As for United, well they have got much bigger problems. 
Arsenal are above them and have got three games in hand but, more importantly, United are not playing particularly well and they have got a tough run-in.
They still have Chelsea and Liverpool to play and, on this evidence, they are going to struggle against them. It would be a huge shock now for them to finish fourth and make next season's Champions League that way.

Hearings have begun in the public inquiry, external scrutinising the UK's response to, and impacts of, the coronavirus pandemic.
As the virus spread, government agencies increasingly published figures on case numbers, hospitalisations and deaths.
To follow alongside the inquiry, the BBC's data team has broken down some of these statistics into key areas from the beginning of the pandemic up to 5 May 2023, when the World Health Organisation declared an end to the virus as a ""global health emergency"", external.
How many people died?
Just under 227,000 people died in the UK with Covid-19 listed as one of the causes on their death certificate. This includes those who had not been tested for the virus prior to their death.
The most deaths reported in this way on a single day was on 19 January 2021, when 1,490 people were registered.
At this point in the pandemic, the first variant of the virus seen in the UK - initially detected in Kent - was dominant. This was subsequently named the 'Alpha' variant by the WHO.
The UK was also only a month into the first stages of its vaccine rollout, which started to reduce the risk of death and serious illness from the virus.
Another way of looking at the impact coronavirus had on the number of people dying in the UK is by counting all deaths over and above the expected number since the pandemic began, sometimes referred to ""excess deaths"", external. 
As of 5 May 2023, this was over 208,000 deaths. For most of the previous three years there were above average levels of deaths in the UK.

How inquiry is exposing deep flaws in Covid decision-making
What to do if you have Covid: Can you go to work or school?
The highest peaks in the first two years of the pandemic were during periods when many people died directly from Covid. Out of nearly 13,000 excess deaths in mid-April 2020, about 9,500 were attributed to the virus.
But a larger portion of the excess seen in the second half of 2022 were driven by other factors, including flu and pressure on the NHS. Of the 3,300 excess deaths in mid-January 2023, about 600 were from Covid.
Compared with other countries, over the three years to February 2023, the UK's death rates went up by more than 5%, which was more than France, Germany and Spain (all up between 3% and 4.5%), but by less than Italy's (up more than 6%).
The US and Eastern European countries like Poland were even harder hit, with death rates more than 10% above their pre-pandemic levels over the three years to February 2023.
How many people caught the virus?
More than 44 million people in the UK, external were estimated to have had the virus between April 2020 and February 2022, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). This is the most accurate measure available as the total number of infections across the country will never be known.
The ONS ran a regular survey through the pandemic: testing randomly chosen people in order to estimate the number of people who had the virus.
Based on the survey, the estimated peak of the pandemic, in cases if not in deaths, was in late March 2022, where at one point about 4.9 million people were thought to have the virus. However, the survey did not capture the first wave of the pandemic, with trials only beginning in England in April 2020.
Figures are still regularly published on the number of recorded coronavirus cases across the UK, from PCR and lateral flow tests. However, recorded cases are not considered to present the most accurate picture for a variety of reasons, including the availability and reach of testing.
How many people were in hospital?
Patients were admitted to hospital with coronavirus more than 1.1 million times between March 2020 and 5 May 2023 across England, Scotland and Northern Ireland.
These were people who tested positive up to two weeks before arriving at hospital, or while being treated. 
In Wales the figures were counted differently, with about 43,000 admissions of those who either had, or were suspected to have, the virus.
The number of patients in hospital with coronavirus peaked in the week to 20 January 2021, at more than 38,000 people.
When a new national lockdown was announced on 5 January 2021, across hospitals in England about one in four general admission beds were occupied by patients with coronavirus.
This period was the first time the health service had to cope with both normal winter pressures, and the additional strain from Covid, which was spreading among an unvaccinated population with little immunity.
How many people got vaccinated?
The rollout of coronavirus vaccines began in the UK on 9 December 2020, when the world's first Pfizer dose was administered to 90-year-old Margaret Keenan in Coventry.
Since then, nearly 176 million Covid vaccines have been administered in various stages up to May 2023. Starting with older and clinically vulnerable people and moving down the age groups into young adults and some children.
Eligible groups were offered two main doses as a minimum, plus a booster dose, with additional boosters for more vulnerable groups later on in the pandemic.
About 88% of people in the UK over the age of 12 (58 million) are thought to have had both a first and second dose of a vaccine, with 93% receiving a single jab.
This is based on the ONS mid-year population estimates for 2021, and vaccine data from up to 7 May in Scotland and 5 May for the other UK nations.
There is some uncertainty, especially in the proportion of people who did not receive a jab. The choice of population estimate makes a significant difference to the proportion of people thought to be vaccinated.
A small number of people (fewer than one million as of September 2022) aged 5-11 had received a first and second dose of a coronavirus jab. In addition, vaccinated people are removed from the figures after they have died, which could inflate the number considered unvaccinated.

The legal restrictions that ruled our lives for two long years are gone in England and on their way out across the UK. We've moved from being ""under the thumb"" of Covid to ""living with"" the virus. 
However, the pandemic is far from over - Covid is here for the long term and some scientists think we are relaxing too early. 
So what do we need to keep an eye out for in the months and years ahead? 
New variants
What's the issue? We've already had the original virus, then the Alpha, Delta and Omicron variants causing significant waves of Covid in the UK. It is simply inevitable that the virus will continue to mutate and create new variants in the future. 
Why is it important? New variants aren't necessarily a problem and we shouldn't panic at every new mutation. It is important to remember we have a significant wall of immunity that should continue to provide protection even against new variants. The vaccines that were developed against the first form of the virus are still saving lives from the latest variant, Omicron. However, it is possible that new variants could significantly change the behaviour of the virus to make it more deadly, spread far more quickly or bypass the protection from either vaccination or previous infection. All of these could make Covid an even greater threat than it is today. 
What can we do about it? There are two approaches: minimise mutations or react when a new variant emerges. There is a risk of mutations every time the virus makes copies of itself so the only way to reduce the risk of variants is to minimise infections at a global level. Instead, the emphasis seems to be on monitoring new variants and reacting accordingly, such as updating vaccines. 
Waning immunity
What's the issue? It has become abundantly clear that immunity wanes over time. People are catching Covid even if they have been triple-jabbed or have caught Covid before. The protection against catching the virus wanes quite quickly, but protection against getting seriously ill or dying is lasting much longer. 
Why is it important? Immunity is the only reason we have been able to relax restrictions. Two years ago our bodies were fighting the virus blind, but now our immune systems have been trained. This level of immunity is the main reason the infection is now less deadly. However, significant waning of immunity could lead to new waves of Covid and even renewed pressure on hospitals. It is possible we will have a ""honeymoon period"", external where it looks like Covid is in total retreat, only for it to bounce back once enough immunity wanes. 
What can we do about it? The amount of protection we have against the virus will need to be constantly monitored. Immediately, this will dictate who gets further vaccine doses and how often. There are already plans to give another booster this spring to the over-75s and people at high risk from the virus. There will be a wider booster campaign in anticipation of next winter, too. In the longer term there is already work under way on a next generation of Covid vaccine to see whether it can provide longer-term protection. 
Covid vaccine ‘waning immunity’: How worried should I be?
Antiviral drug resistance
What's the issue? Drugs that kill the virus are now being used to keep people out of hospital, but there is a danger that if we use them badly, the virus will evolve to render the drugs ineffective. 
Why is it important? Some scientists think this is the single most important issue in the months ahead. We are familiar with hard-to-treat superbugs, from MRSA to super-gonorrhoea, which were created by misusing antibiotics. The same process can happen with antivirals. These drugs, such as Paxlovid and molnupiravir, are currently playing a vital role in saving lives and are one reason restrictions are being eased. Even more importantly, they are the safety net in the future. If a new variant emerges that significantly bypasses our immunity, we will be dependent on antivirals to buy us time until an updated vaccine can be developed and rolled out. 
What can we do about it? The more you use antivirals the greater the risk of resistance, which means they will need to be used carefully in the people with the most to gain from them. This could lead to difficult decisions around treating a patient today and preserving them for the patients of the future. One solution is using several antivirals in combination, which greatly reduces the risk of the virus becoming resistant.  
How close to normal will our lives get?
What's the issue? Life is still far from normal and nobody knows for sure how we are all going to react to the changes in restrictions and testing. This creates huge uncertainty in the weeks and months to come. 
Why is it important? It is obvious, but Covid is spread from one person to another - the more we congregate together, the greater the opportunities for the virus. So what happens now? Will we all return to our workplace or is home-working the norm now? Will we buy tests when they used to be free? If we get ill, will we isolate or crack on as soon as we feel okay even if we may still be contagious? What will vulnerable people who used to shield do now? How long will people keep on wearing face masks in crowded places? The impact of our shifting behaviour is likely to be greater than any seasonal impact on the virus. The uncertainty means we could continue to have declining infections and people in hospital or it could swing into reverse. However, high levels of immunity mean overwhelming pressure on the NHS is highly unlikely.
What can we do about it? Very little. The decisions have now been made. Legal rules have been replaced with advice on what to do in the future. England's chief medical officer, Prof Sir Chris Whitty, says people should continue isolating if they test positive, even though there is no legal requirement to do so.
Long Covid
What's the issue? Not everyone rapidly recovers from an infection and some develop ""long Covid"". Further infections could increase the numbers with long Covid.
Why is it important? Long Covid can be utterly debilitating. Persistent fatigue is common in long Covid, along with brain fog, shortness of breath and muscle pain. More than one in 50 people in the UK say they have long Covid and more than half a million have symptoms that have already lasted more than a year. It is not clear what will happen in the future - is long Covid just a feature of this virus and will always happen, or will it fade away as our immunity improves? Studies have suggested vaccination reduces the risk of long Covid, but does not eliminate it.
What can we do about it? The number of cases of long Covid will need to be monitored. Understanding why the virus causes long Covid and what the best treatments are could speed up people's recovery.

The following groups can have an NHS Covid booster between 3 October and 20 December:
over-65s
people aged between six months and 64 years with health conditions that make them more vulnerable, including pregnant women
people living in care homes for older people
frontline NHS and social care workers, and those working in care homes for older people

Which Covid vaccines are used in the UK?
Vaccines from two companies are currently in use across the UK: Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna.
People are advised to take whichever vaccine they are offered, as both provide protection against severe illness or death.
AstraZeneca pulled its Covid vaccine worldwide because of the surplus of updated vaccines from its competitors.

You need to be aged 12 or above, and must not have had a Covid vaccine in the previous three months. You also need to talk to a health professional to check that it is suitable. 
A protein-based booster vaccine made by Novavax, which works differently to the Pfizer and Moderna jabs, is also available.
Moderna is hoping to launch a combined flu and Covid vaccine in 2025 or 2026, after the jab passed a vital part of final-stage scientific checks in June 2024.
Pfizer and BioNTech are testing a similar two-in-one mRNA vaccine against flu and Covid.
How long after having Covid can I have a jab?
If you have Covid, or think you might, the NHS recommends delaying vaccination until you feel better., external
It also advises postponing if you have a high temperature or feel otherwise unwell with any illness.

Rules around face coverings are easing across the UK, but they are still required in some settings.
Heathrow Airport and a number of airlines are relaxing their rules on masks.
But Nicola Sturgeon has said face coverings must still be worn in Scotland after all other legal requirements are lifted on 21 March. 
What is the situation in Scotland?
First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has confirmed that Scotland's rules on face coverings will remain in place until April, due to a rise in Covid cases. 
All other restrictions on businesses and services will move from legal requirement to guidance on 21 March.
The rules on masks will be reviewed again on 29 March, and are expected to be converted to guidance by 4 April.
At the moment, masks must be worn, external in most indoor public spaces including public transport, shops and gyms (although they can be temporarily removed when exercising).
They are mandatory in pubs and restaurants when not seated or dancing, as well as in the workplace in communal areas and canteens. 
They no longer have to be worn by secondary school students in the classroom - but are still required in ""indoor communal areas"" like corridors.
Under-12s are exempt.
What are the Covid rules in Scotland?
What is the situation in England?
Masks are no longer legally required in most public spaces - although they are still recommended in some situations:
face coverings remain a requirement in healthcare settings, external, such as GP surgeries, hospitals and care homes
government guidance recommends that people still wear face coverings in enclosed or private spaces where they are mixing with people they don't know
many major retailers including Tesco, Sainsburys, Lidl, Waitrose and John Lewis have asked staff and customers to keep wearing masks
face coverings are no longer mandatory on Transport for London's tubes, trains or buses, but are still ""strongly encouraged""
face coverings are no longer mandatory in Heathrow Airport's terminals, railway stations or office buildings, but are still recommended
British Airways and Virgin Atlantic have said air passengers will only have to wear masks if their destination country requires it
What are the latest changes to the UK's Covid rules?
What is the situation in Wales?
Face coverings are no longer required in classrooms and some venues such as museums and cinemas.
However, they will still need to be worn in shops, salons, hairdressers, health and social care settings and on public transport.
The Welsh government has said it intends to lift all remaining Covid regulations by the end of March. 
Masks no longer needed in classrooms and cinemas
Wales' mask and isolation laws could end in March
What is the situation in Northern Ireland?
Mask-wearing is no longer legally enforced in Northern Ireland.
However, face coverings are still recommended in certain places, such as enclosed public spaces and health and social care settings.
Northern Ireland's last Covid rules are lifted
What are the remaining Covid regulations set to go?
How much can I be fined for not wearing a mask?
In Wales, the penalty for a first offence is £60, with the fine doubling for each subsequent offence - up to a maximum of £1,920. Repeat offenders can also be prosecuted in court where fines are unlimited.
In Scotland, the police can issue a penalty notice of up to £60 for breaking the law on mask-wearing.
Why use a face covering?
Evidence suggests transmission mainly happens indoors, external, where people are close together.
Covering the nose and mouth reduces the spread of coronavirus droplets from coughs, sneezes and while speaking.
The main purpose is to protect others, although there is some evidence they offer protection to wearers.
Five ways to avoid catching coronavirus indoors
What sort of face covering is best? 
It should:
have a nose wire
have at least two or three layers of material
fit snugly over mouth, nose and chin 
Standard surgical masks are acceptable. It is also possible to buy FFP2 and FFP3 masks used by healthcare workers which can offer higher protection. However, these must be fitted correctly to work.

So you've caught Covid. What now? 
How can you look after yourself or someone else at home, and when should you get extra help?
Tell family and friends
Let people know that you have Covid. 
They might be able to help by dropping off food or other supplies, and check how you are doing.
The NHS also has volunteers who can help with things like shopping and collecting medicines. Find out more online, external or by calling 0808 196 3646 (8am to 8pm, seven days a week).
Anyone who tests positive for Covid is no longer legally required to self-isolate, although it is still recommended. 
You are also no longer legally obliged to tell your employer that you have Covid, but are still advised to stay at home and avoid contact with others for at least five full days.
What are the self-isolation rules?
How many Covid cases are there in the UK?
Why are so many people catching Covid again? 
What symptoms can you expect?
Many people will have mild or no symptoms, and will be able to safely ride out the infection at home.
The official list of Covid symptoms has been expanded in England, external - but not yet in the rest of the UK - from the original three: 
a new, continuous cough
a fever or high temperature
loss of or change to smell or taste
It now includes nine other symptoms which are also common signs of other respiratory infections:
shortness of breath
feeling tired or exhausted, lack of energy
muscle aches or pains
headache that lasts longer than usual
blocked or runny nose
sore throat, stuffy or runny nose
loss of appetite
diarrhoea
feeling sick or being sick
It's not possible to tell if you have Covid, flu or another respiratory infection based on symptoms alone, official advice says.
But spotting these symptoms can help to reduce the spread to other more vulnerable people.
If you have any of these symptoms plus a high temperature or you don't feel well enough to go to work or school, you're advised to stay at home.
What else can you do?
Get lots of rest, drink plenty of water and take paracetamol or ibuprofen to help you feel more comfortable. 
For a cough, try lying on your side or sitting upright rather than on your back. 
Sitting up, rather than lying down, is also good if you are a bit breathless. 
You could also try:
breathing slowly in through your nose and out through your mouth, with your lips together like you're gently blowing out a candle
relaxing your shoulders, so you're not hunched, and leaning forward slightly with your hands on your knees
turning down the heating a bit and letting in some fresh air
Tips for breathlessness, external
Pulse oximeters have been widely used during the pandemic
Some people find a gadget called a pulse oximeter useful. It clips on to your finger and checks the level of oxygen in your blood, external. 
This can be a useful measurement to know, a bit like tracking your temperature with a thermometer. 
Low levels of oxygen in your blood can be a sign you're getting worse.
A reading of 95 or above is normal. 
If it drops to 93 or 94 and stays like that an hour later, call 111 or your GP for advice. If it is 92 or below (on a device that is certified with a CE mark, and which you are using according to the instructions), go to A&E or call 999.
Pulse oxygen monitors work less well on darker skin, experts say
When should you get medical help?
The NHS website, external has lots of information about Covid, and you can also get advice over the phone from a pharmacist. 
Some people with Covid will need medical care, which might include staying in hospital. 
The NHS is also offering some high risk patients a pill they can take at home to help cut the risk of their infection becoming more serious.
Get advice from NHS 111 or your GP if: 
you're feeling gradually more unwell or more breathless
you have difficulty breathing when you stand up or move around
you feel very weak, achy or tired
you're shaking or shivering
you've lost your appetite
you're unable to care for yourself - for example, you're struggling to wash, dress or feed yourself
you still feel unwell after four weeks - you may have long Covid
Go to A&E immediately or call 999 if:
you're so breathless that you can't say short sentences when resting
your breathing gets suddenly worse
you cough up blood
you feel cold and sweaty, with pale or blotchy skin
you have a rash that looks like small bruises or bleeding under the skin, and does not fade when you roll a glass over it
you collapse or faint
you feel agitated, confused or very drowsy
you've stopped peeing or are peeing much less than usual
If you're worried about a baby or child, don't delay getting help. If they seem very unwell, are getting worse, or you think there's something seriously wrong, call 999.
BOOSTER: Who can get the fourth jab and how do you book it?
SYMPTOMS: Is a runny nose a cold or Covid?
TESTS: Who can still get free tests?
ISOLATION: What is the Covid isolation advice now?
COVID CASES: How many cases are there in my area?
LONG COVID: What is it and what are the symptoms?
TREATMENT: What progress is being made?

The true extent of the first outbreak in 2020 is unclear because testing was not then widely available.
Deaths are falling in many areas, however official figures may not fully reflect the true number in many countries. 
Data on excess deaths, a measure of how many more people are dying than would be expected based on the previous few years, may give a better indication of the actual numbers in many cases. 
Using this metric, researchers from the Lancet medical journal suggest that more than 18 million people may have died because of Covid up to the end of 2021. That figure is three times higher than officially recorded deaths from the disease.
Separate analysis by the World Health Organization (WHO) estimates about 15 million excess deaths due to coronavirus over a similar period.
Who has vaccinated the most?
Nearly every nation in the world is now administering vaccines and publishing rollout data, while at least 157 countries and territories have moved on to booster jabs. 
The map below, using figures collated by Our World in Data, external - a collaboration between Oxford University and an educational charity - shows the total number of doses given per 100 people, mostly first doses.
According to that data, external, more than 64% of people have been fully vaccinated on every continent apart from Africa, where the figure is about 20%.

                    This information is regularly updated but may not reflect the latest totals or vaccines administered for each location. Total doses may include booster doses in addition to those required for full vaccination. The definition of full vaccination varies by location and vaccine type and is subject to change over time. Full vaccination can refer to a person receiving all required doses of a specific vaccine or sometimes recovery from infection plus one dose of a vaccine. Definitions have not yet been updated to account for booster campaigns to control the spread of new variants. Some locations may reach vaccination rates over 100%, such as Gibraltar, due to population estimates that are lower than the number of people who have now been vaccinated in that place.

Some countries have secured more vaccine doses than their populations need, while other lower-income countries are relying on a global plan known as Covax, which is seeking to ensure everyone in the world has access to a vaccine. 
Of those countries that have moved on to booster campaigns, Chile, Uruguay and Singapore have currently vaccinated the highest proportion of people. 
How fast is vaccination progress around the world?
Where are cases still high?
Daily global cases fell after a spike in the spring but are now rising again, with the emergence of the BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants of the Omicron variant.
Studies suggest that Omicron - which quickly became dominant in numerous countries - is milder than the Delta variant, but far more contagious. The subvariants are even more contagious. 
Asia
Asia, which was the centre of the initial outbreak that spread from Wuhan in China in early 2020, shows a mixed picture.
North Korea, which admitted its first Covid infections in May of this year, has now seen 4.75 million symptomatic ""fever cases"" according to the state news agency. 
China appears to have recovered from a recent spike which earlier saw thousands of cases reported each day and millions of people placed under lockdown in large cities such as Shanghai. However, a fresh outbreak appears to be under way in eastern Anhui Province.
In Japan, after two years of closure the government reopened its borders to visitors from 98 countries and regions but with strict limitations. 
It marked the most significant moment so far in the country's slow relaxation of its Covid-19 entry restrictions.
Europe
Reported daily cases are rising in several European countries, due to the BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants. Testing is also now more limited than at previous points in the pandemic.
In the UK, the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show a 32% jump in infections last week. Hospitalisations are also increasing. 
North America
The US has recorded 87 million cases and more than a million deaths - the highest figures in the world. 
However, daily cases and death counts have now fallen to lower levels than during much of the pandemic. 
Latin America
Latin America is seeing some pockets of rising cases, though infections are at low levels among the countries which were hardest hit previously.
Mexico and Guatemala are among countries seeing a rise in June.
Brazil has been the worst-hit country in the region overall, recording more than 32 million cases and 672,000 deaths - the world's second-highest official death toll. 
In Peru, there have been over 213,000 deaths and the country has the world's highest number of deaths by population size - more than 657 deaths for every 100,000 people.
Africa
Africa has seen more than 12 million cases and 255,000 deaths - but the true extent of the pandemic across the continent is not known as testing rates are low.
According to the official figures, South Africa has been the worst-hit country with more than 4 million confirmed cases and more than 100,000 deaths. 
South Africa was the first country to identify the new Omicron variant and it led to a sharp increase in infections - the fourth wave of infections in the country.
Middle East
Several countries in the Middle East have seen severe outbreaks of the virus since the pandemic began, though levels are currently at their lowest this year.
The official death toll in Iran, the region's worst-hit country, is more than 140,000 and it has seen over seven million confirmed cases. 
Neighbouring Iraq has seen 25,000 deaths and in excess of two million confirmed cases.
In January Israel was hit by the Omicron wave seen across the world, but infections have now come down. Its vaccination rollout has been highly successful at minimising the number of hospitalisations and deaths in the country. 
Oceania
Early in the pandemic, Australia and New Zealand were widely praised for their response to Covid but both saw an increase in cases at the start of the year. 
So far, Australia has seen more than 8 million confirmed cases, with spikes in January and April. It has also recorded more than 10,000 confirmed deaths due to coronavirus.
Daily cases are rising in New Zealand following a fall. So far it recorded 1.3 million cases, but only 1,535 deaths.
In early May the country opened its borders to international visitors for the first time in two years.
How did coronavirus spread?
Covid-19 was first detected in the city of Wuhan, China, in late 2019 but the outbreak spread quickly across the globe in the first months of 2020.
It was declared a global pandemic by the WHO on 11 March 2020.
A pandemic is when an infectious disease is passing easily from person to person in many parts of the world at the same time.

About this data
The data used on this page comes from a variety of sources. It includes figures collated by Johns Hopkins University as well as national governments and health agencies.
When comparing figures from different countries it is important to bear in mind that not all governments are recording coronavirus cases and deaths in the same way. This makes like for like comparisons between countries difficult.
Other factors to consider include: different population sizes, the size of a country's elderly population or whether a particular country has a large amount of its people living in densely-populated areas. In addition, countries may be in different stages of the pandemic.
The map, table and animated bar chart in this page use a different source for the UK from that used by Johns Hopkins University. US figures do not include Puerto Rico, Guam or the US Virgin Islands. Figures for France are for the mainland only and include both suspected and confirmed cases.

Get NHS help with Covid recovery, external
Where can you get a Covid test?
Routine Covid testing is not recommended, and most people can't get free tests via the NHS. 
You may still be able to get free NHS tests, external if you:
have a health condition that makes you eligible for treatment if you test positive
work in healthcare or a hospice
You can buy a test for about £2 from High Street and online chemists, but cannot report these test results to the NHS.
Do you have to isolate after testing positive?
People are largely advised to treat Covid like any other respiratory disease. You no longer have to self-isolate after testing positive.
However, the government recommends trying to stay home for five days - or three for under-18s, as younger people tend to be infectious for a shorter period.

Those who have a high temperature or still feel unwell after five days are advised to stay home if they can until they:
feel well enough for your normal activities
no longer have a high temperature
Can you go to work with Covid?
You don't have to tell your employer you have Covid. 
However, you are asked to avoid contact with others for five days, which means you should work from home if you can, especially if you have a high temperature. 
The specific schemes offering financial support to those isolating during the pandemic have ended. 
But you may be entitled to Statutory Sick Pay, external - worth £109.40 a week.
Can children go to school with Covid?
Under-18s who test positive for Covid are advised to stay at home for three days.

Who can have a Covid jab?
In the UK, you can only have the Covid vaccine via the NHS, external if you meet certain criteria.
For most people, vaccinations are now available only as part of a seasonal rollout.  You cannot currently buy them privately. 
The 2023 autumn booster campaign is targeting:
residents in care homes for older adults
over-65s
people aged six months to 64 years in a clinical risk group
front-line health and social-care workers
12-64-year-olds who are household contacts of people with weakened immune systems
16-64-year-olds who are carers or work in care homes for older adults
pregnant women
The NHS has been contacting eligible people. 
You can no longer book a Covid jab online or by calling NHS 119, external - but you may be able to with a local NHS vaccination service or you can find a walk-in site, external.

Pfizer is also exploring options for private provision. 
Who can get another Covid jab this autumn?
How long after having Covid can you have a jab?
If you have Covid, or think you might, NHS advice is to delay vaccination until you feel better, external.
It also recommends waiting if you have a high temperature or feel otherwise unwell with any illness.
But there is no need to wait if you have recently recovered from Covid and feel well.
The vaccines do not infect people with Covid and cannot cause positive test results.

Most people in England and Scotland can no longer get free PCR or lateral flow tests (LFTs). 
A few groups are still entitled to free Covid tests, including the most vulnerable, as well as frontline NHS staff. 
Some limited free testing for the public will continue in Wales and Northern Ireland until the end of June. 
What's the guidance if I have Covid now?
How has testing changed in England?
Free LFTs are no longer generally available to members of the public.  
Most people with symptoms are no longer entitled to free PCR tests either. 
Some groups can still get free tests:
NHS staff who care for patients
hospital patients who need PCRs before treatment
care home residents
people working in high-risk settings, including care homes and prisons
hospital patients who are discharged to care homes or hospices
If you still qualify, you may be able to order LFTs online, external (if you have an NHS login), or by calling 119. 
People who are eligible for community Covid drug treatments because they're at higher risk if they catch Covid are being sent LFTs to keep at home in case they develop symptoms. 
The government says it will be able to expand the testing system again in the future if necessary, such as if a new variant of concern emerges. 
You may still need to test before or after travelling abroad. You must buy private tests, external for this - you can't use free NHS tests.

Can I buy lateral flow tests now?
Yes. High street pharmacies charge about £2 per test.
The government has a list of private test providers, external. 
However, you cannot report the result of a privately-bought LFT on the government website. 
How is testing changing in Scotland?
People with symptoms in Scotland are no longer asked to take a PCR test and self isolate - instead they are advised to stay at home, external while they are unwell or have a fever.
Testing for the general population has ended, apart from certain groups, external including health and social workers, hospital or care home visitors, hospital patients and unpaid carers.
How is testing changing in Wales?

Fully vaccinated people travelling to the UK no longer have to take any Covid tests - either before departure or on arrival. 
The prime minister has announced that he intends to remove England's remaining Covid restrictions at the end of the month.
What changes have come into force for vaccinated travellers?
Fully vaccinated travellers (two doses) and under-18s no longer need to take a test either before or after they arrive in England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. 
To qualify as vaccinated, non-UK travellers must have received their jabs in a country or territory with ""approved proof of vaccination""., external This now covers most countries in the world, with more - including China - due to join on 11 February.

What Covid rules remain across the UK?
What if I'm unvaccinated?
Unvaccinated travellers still have to show proof of a negative Covid test taken two days before departure.
They must also take a post-arrival PCR test two days after arrival. This must be booked before travelling to the UK and bought privately from a government-approved list of providers. , external
If this is positive, they need to self-isolate.
However, unvaccinated travellers no longer have to self-isolate on arrival, or take a test on day eight. 
What other rules are still in force?
All unvaccinated travellers to the UK must complete a passenger locator form, external before departure. 
How do I prove vaccinations and test results at the UK border?
Digital Covid passes showing your vaccination status can be downloaded to your phone, whether you're in England, external, Scotland, external, Wales, external or Northern Ireland, external. 
Test results can be in the form of a printed document, or an email or text on your phone. They must be in English, French or Spanish.
European Union residents can use the EU Digital Covid Certificate to show their vaccination status or test results.
Since 3 February, 12 to 15-year-olds in England have also been able to prove their vaccination status via the digital NHS pass.
Where do I need to use a Covid passport?
What about other countries' rules?
You are responsible for checking the entry requirements for any other countries you wish to visit,, external as well as the local Covid restrictions which are in force. These can change quickly.
Many UK families have cancelled half-term trips to mainland Spain and the Canary Islands because children over 12 must be double vaccinated to enter. 
Very few countries allow unrestricted access to those who have not been vaccinated.
It is thought more than 80 holiday destinations around the world still require all UK travellers to take a pre-departure PCR test before arrival.
UK-issued Covid passes can be used throughout the EU to show proof of vaccination - either digitally, or as a printed download (as long as it is dated after than 1 November 2021).

61,61,How will the vulnerable be protected from Covid? And other questions,"Tue, 22 Feb 2022 15:25:22 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-51176409,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-51176409?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,The government has announced the end of all Covid restrictions in England.,"How will the vulnerable be protected from Covid? And other questions
The government has announced the end of all legal Covid restrictions in England, and Scotland has taken similar steps.
Here are some of your questions on the changes:
Questions and answers
Testing and vaccines
Because your son is in a clinical risk group - and as long as he is over five - he should soon be offered two doses of the Pfizer vaccine. You should be contacted by your GP or specialist team to arrange this.
With regard to the dangers of mixing, the UK has also recommended that Covid vaccines are offered to all children aged 5 to 11, not just those at high clinical risk. This is likely to start in England in April. Children are generally at much lower risk of becoming seriously ill from a Covid infection, although some do still get sick and need hospital care. Over-12s can already be vaccinated, and it's hoped that extending the rollout to younger age groups will help protect even more children from the risk of catching and spreading Covid.
Schools are expected to work with and support families who have concerns about a pupil returning to the classroom. It is compulsory for school-age children to attend, even if they were previously shielding - the only exception is a small number of children whose clinician or GP has advised them not to attend. If you have concerns about this, you should talk to your doctor.
If you live in England and are not in a vulnerable group yourself, it is unlikely that you will be entitled to a free test after 1 April. From that point, lateral flow tests should be available to buy from pharmacies and other retailers.
The government says it will continue to provide free tests to the oldest age groups and those most vulnerable to Covid. We don't have the details of how this will work yet, but your mother and her care workers should still be eligible for free tests.
Care homes are responsible for their own visiting policies, but at the moment across the UK, all visitors are expected to test for Covid before arrival.  
The chief scientific adviser Patrick Vallance has warned that further variants of Covid are expected - and that they could be more severe than previous ones.
                        
Therefore, although most of the free testing system is being dismantled in England, the government insists that the UK will continue to do detailed checks and surveillance to look for resurgences of Covid and any concerning new variants which may emerge. 
For example, some people in the community will still be asked to do regular tests for Covid as part of the Office for National Statistics’ Infection Survey.
Positive test results collected this way can be analysed to identify the type of Covid people have. Throughout the pandemic, scientists have learned a great deal about how to track the virus, and the government says it will be possible to scale up such operations again in the future if necessary. 
Trials are already underway to test updated vaccines that could be a better match for the virus as it continues to change. 
The UK government also says it will also help support other countries in developing their own surveillance capabilities, because a new variant can emerge anywhere.
NHS England says patients and staff should continue to wear face masks in GP practices even though they are no longer mandatory in public places.
Face coverings also remain compulsory in healthcare settings in Scotland and Wales, and it is ""strongly advised"" that people wear them in Northern Ireland.
Your doctor will be able to advise about what tests you will need before you have an operation. 
You may need to have a Covid test, and the government has said free testing will still be available in certain settings, such as hospitals. Infection control measures will continue to help keep people safe and limit the spread of the virus.

62,62,Ukraine conflict: Oil price soars to highest level since 2008,"Mon, 07 Mar 2022 09:00:31 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-60642786,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-60642786?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,Consumers are feeling the impact of higher energy costs as fuel prices and household bills jump.,"Ukraine conflict: Petrol at fresh record as oil and gas prices soar
Petrol prices have hit another record high as oil and gas costs soar amid fears of a global economic shock from Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
Oil jumped to $139 a barrel at one point, the highest level for almost 14 years, while wholesale gas prices for next-day delivery more than doubled.
It came as the US hinted at a ban on buying Russian energy, as it looked to other countries to increase supplies.
However, European leaders rejected that idea on Monday. 
German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said Europe had ""deliberately exempted"" Russian energy from sanctions because its supply cannot be secured ""any other way"" at the moment. 
And Netherlands prime minister Mark Rutte said: ""The painful reality is we are still very much dependent on Russian gas and Russian oil and if you now force European companies to quit doing business with Russia that would have enormous ramifications around Europe including Ukraine but also around the world.
""We have to reduce our dependency. That will take time,"" he added. 
Market turmoil
UK petrol prices have hit an average of 155p a litre, the AA motoring group said.
The market turmoil is fuelling concerns that the price of many everyday items from food to petrol and heating, already rising at their fastest rate for 30 years, could be pushed higher.
Analysts have already warned that UK energy bills could reach as high as £3,000 a year due to the surge in oil and gas prices. 
Russia is the world's second top producer of crude oil after Saudi Arabia, and supplies about a third of Europe's needs. The price of Brent crude rose by more than a fifth last week amid fears of a reduction in Russian supplies.
After peaking at $139.13 a barrel early on Monday, the price of Brent crude - an international benchmark - fell back to around $125.
Ukraine war 'catastrophic for global food'
EU mulls weaponising energy in Russia crisis
The latest rise in UK petrol prices has pushed the cost to more than £7 a gallon, the AA said. Filling up a car with a 55-litre tank now costs nearly £17 more than a year ago, rising from £68.60 to £85.59.
The boss of fuel delivery firm Portland Fuel, James Spencer, told the BBC he thought fuel prices could reach £1.70-£1.75 a litre. ""Even if we can get extra [oil] supplies on to the market, nothing will happen quickly."" 
He said that, to a certain extent, individual car drivers have options to cut their use by driving less, but added that businesses that have no alternatives were really starting to feel the squeeze.
The crisis continues to affect share markets. The main stock exchanges in France and Germany sank more than 4% in early trading before paring their losses, closing 1.3% and 2% lower respectively. 
In London, the FTSE 100 dropped more than 2%, but then recovered to close 0.4% lower. Last week, the FTSE had its worse week since the start of the pandemic in March 2020.
In the US, markets ended lower with the Dow Jones and S&P 500 down 2.4% and 3% respectively. The Dow is now in a ""correction"", having fallen 10% since its last record closing level on 4 January.
The price of gold, a haven in troubled times for investors looking for security, hit $2,000 an ounce for the first time in almost 18 months.
These are massive movements in the price of commodities - the raw materials that eventually feed, warm and transport us.
The extra movements this morning arose out of talk of an embargo on Russian oil. That is very significant, because Russia is the second biggest world exporter. Anyone passing a petrol station would have seen the impact. If there was an actual embargo, the price of an average tank could head close to £100, and indeed is already there at the most expensive service stations in the UK.
But we don't need to be physically reliant on actual Russian supplies for it to feed through into the prices our suppliers pay and then pass on to us. The price for gas in international markets was already at incredible highs last week. It further increased by a third to frankly frightening levels, 10- to 15-times normal, above £6 per therm. 
If in the first half of this year these prices average £3.20, then typical dual fuel bills in October could rise to £3,000 a year or £250 a month.
On Sunday, the US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the Biden administration and its allies were discussing a ban on Russian oil supplies.
The comments came as pressure grows on the White House and other Western nations to take tougher action against Moscow over its invasion of Ukraine.
A Russian oil embargo would be a major escalation in the response to the invasion of Ukraine and would potentially have a major impact on the global economy. 
However, some European countries are reluctant given their dependence on Russian energy supplies. 
""While the US might just push through a ban on Russian oil imports, Europe can ill-afford to do the same. More worryingly, [Russian leader Vladimir] Putin, with his back to the wall, could turn off gas supplies to Europe, cutting off the continent's energy lifeline,"" said Vandana Hari at oil markets analysis firm Vanda Insights.
Mr Johnson said Europe could not simply shut down the use of oil and gas overnight, but that countries should move together quickly to look beyond Russia for its oil and gas supplies.
On Sunday, energy giant Shell defended its decision to purchase Russian crude oil despite the invasion of Ukraine.
The company said it was forced to buy oil from Russia in order to maintain timely supplies of fuel to Europe.
""To be clear, without an uninterrupted supply of crude oil to refineries, the energy industry cannot assure continued provision of essential products to people across Europe over the weeks ahead,"" a spokesperson added.
A possible ban on buying Russian oil has intensified pressure to find alternative supplies. 
The US is this week expected to press Saudi Arabia to increase crude production, and there is fresh impetus for a deal over Iran's nuclear ambitions that would lift sanctions on its oil exports.
However, progress on a deal has been hampered after Russia sought a US guarantee that the sanctions it faces over the Ukraine conflict will not affect its trade with Tehran.

63,63,One dead after Scottish trawler capsizes off Norway,"Mon, 07 Mar 2022 08:59:37 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-60645898,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-60645898?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,Seven crew members were rescued after the Peterhead-registered Njord got into difficulty in the North Sea.,"One dead after trawler which sailed from Peterhead capsizes off Norway
The Njord had sailed from Peterhead
A man has died and seven crew members have been rescued after a fishing trawler capsized off Norway.
The Njord, which left Peterhead on Saturday afternoon, got into difficulty in the North Sea, about 100 nautical miles west of Stavanger.
Rescuers found the crew on the keel of the capsized boat on Sunday afternoon. 
The Norwegian Joint Rescue Co-ordination Centre (JRCC) said three who had ingested diesel were airlifted to hospital in Bergen and one later died. 
Five others were picked up by an offshore vessel, the Olympic Challenger.
The JRCC said there was no radio contact with the stricken 24m (79ft) vessel, which was previously called Courageous when it worked out of Lerwick in Shetland.
A spokesman said they were automatically alerted by the trawler's emergency position-indicating radio beacon (EPIRB), which activated when it started taking on water. 
'Sitting on the keel'
Ståle Jamtli from the JRCC told BBC Scotland the helicopter rescue was scrambled from a nearby offshore platform.
""They were there I guess after 20-something minutes,"" he said. ""When they arrived at the wreck, they saw some people sitting on the keel of the vessel - the vessel had capsized and two people I think were in the water. 
""Five of them were picked up by a nearby vessel that came to aid. The three people that were hoisted into the helicopter, they were brought to hospital in Bergen. They all had swallowed some diesel oil. The five other guys were then picked up by another helicopter and sent ashore, but they were in fairly good shape."" 
He added: ""When you consider the circumstances, I guess they were lucky because they got a really fast recovery or help because there was an offshore helicopter that close by. 
""It probably went very fast, the capsizing, because they didn't have any rescue gear or life rescue suits on them either, so they were just in normal working clothes. They would be cold. So they were lucky that they were rescued that fast.""
A major air and sea rescue operation was launched
The Olympic Challenger's captain Sven Tore Ask received the distress message. They were five nautical miles away when they set off towards the fishing boat.
They sent out a small boat and rescued five of the crew who were in the water, before giving them warm clothes, food and drink, before the rescue helicopter arrived and transported them ashore.
Shipowner Stig Remøy said: ""The crew has done a great job, where the quick action taken has clearly saved lives.""
The UK's Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) said it received a distress alert from the EPIRB at 13:49 on Sunday in the Norwegian search and rescue region.
The Norwegian Coastguard was contacted and confirmed it had also received the alert and a helicopter had been sent. 
It is believed the boat, built in 1992, sailed from Peterhead on Saturday afternoon and is registered in North Shields.
No details about the dead man or the crew members have been released.
An FCDO (Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office) spokesperson said: ""We are supporting the family of a British man following his death in Norway. We are also supporting a British man who is hospitalised in Bergen. We remain in contact with the Norwegian authorities.""

64,64,Ukraine: Irish medical student 'blocking out dangers' in Sumy,"Mon, 07 Mar 2022 06:59:12 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-60638895,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-60638895?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,A 19-year-old Irish woman is among hundreds of international students taking cover in Sumy.,"Ukraine: Irish student makes fresh escape attempt

Racheal Diyaolu has been taking cover in her university's bunker since the Russian invasion
An Irish medical student is attempting to leave Ukraine after sheltering for days from airstrikes and shelling in the eastern town of Sumy.
Racheal Diyaolu, who is 19 and from Carlow, was among hundreds of international students in the city close to Ukraine's border with Russia.
Sumy has been under attack by Russia since its invasion started last month.
Racheal told BBC News NI she had been mentally ""blocking out"" the dangers she faced.
It is understood she left Sumy on Monday after she was picked up by two Scottish men attempting a rescue who her family had been in contact with.
Her sister, Christiana, said she had passed safely through a number of checkpoints and was staying overnight at a ""safe stopover location"" before a curfew begins.
""The relief just knowing that they're safe and sheltered,"" she told BBC Radio Ulster's Evening Extra programme.
""We're hoping for the best now.""
A previous rescue effort failed on Sunday when a minivan used by the men was targeted by ""warning shots"" from Russian forces as they tried to enter Sumy, Racheal said.
However, they managed to reach an agreed pick-up location on Monday morning.
Change of plans
On Monday night, Racheal said that the group planned to head for Moldova on Tuesday.
""Hopefully we'll be able to get to the border and find our way through, and get home soon,"" she said in a video, posted on Twitter.

Earlier, she had told RTÉ's Morning Ireland programme they hoped to travel in the direction of Poland, a journey which could take up to 20 hours.
She was not sure if they could make use of humanitarian corridors. 
""I have left behind lots of friends who are still stuck there and still looking for ways to get out, and most of my belongings as well,"" she explained.
""I'm fine, just trying to stay in high spirits and keep positive that we'll make it to Poland.""
Christiana said the Scottish men had their phones seized during the attack on Sunday before being told to turn back.
""Luckily they were able to find an alternative route into Sumy and stayed there overnight and then continued their mission this morning,"" she added.
Racheal has been studying in Ukraine since November
The Irish Department of Foreign Affairs told BBC News NI it was aware of 52 Irish citizens remaining in Ukraine.
On Sunday, UN monitors said 364 civilian deaths had been confirmed in Ukraine since the invasion began on 24 February, but the real figure was likely to be ""considerably higher"".
Ms Diyaolu arrived in the country from the Republic of Ireland for her studies last November.
Since the invasion started, she has been taking cover in her university's bunker when air raid sirens have sounded.
""Someone will come and knock on your door on all the floors to let them know that it's time to go down and take cover, bring your essentials and your documents,"" she told BBC News NI before her latest attempt to leave Sumy.
The Ukrainian deputy prime minister has said Russia is striking civilian targets in Ukraine, including hospitals, nurseries, and schools.

IN DEPTH: Full coverage of the conflict
At the beginning of the invasion, Russian tanks and troops poured into Ukraine at points along its borders including northern regions such as Sumy. 
Ms Diyaolu said it had been ""an out-of-body experience"" to know there is such danger outside.
""I've had to train my mind to block out the fact that this is incoming danger,"" she told BBC News NI.
""It does happen so frequently at this point that you kind of don't have time to be afraid any more.""
Russian forces have been heavily shelling towns outside the capital of Kyiv
The student said things had become quite difficult in Sumy, ""especially for people who are trying to get out"".
""It's been quite hard going, we've had a lot of air strike threats, we've had quite a few bombs being dropped,"" she said.
'I haven't lost hope'
The medical student said she had tried to ""hold on to hope"" that she would be able to get home.
""It's especially hard on my mother, she's just worried to death all day every day, trying to get in contact with me,"" she said.
""The best thing I can do is stay calm when I am talking to her, letting her know that I'm OK.
""I know that I'm in a scary situation and in a dangerous area, but letting her know that I'm OK, mentally and physically, and that my mind is with them at home and my mind is focused on staying safe and trying to find ways to get out.""
Ms Diyaolu's family have been calling for more help from the Irish government to bring the 19-year-old home.
Ireland's Department of Foreign Affairs said it could not comment on specific cases, but confirmed it was in contact with Irish citizens in Ukraine.
It has advised people to ""shelter in a secure place"" or, if it is safe to do so, to ""consider leaving Ukraine, depending on their location and prevailing circumstances"".

Photographer Wil Cheung said this was a one-in-a-million shot
A family photo with the Northern Lights became a ""one-in-a-million"" shot after a shooting star flew in the background.
Steve Swan, his partner Louise Redpath and their children were posing during a stargazing night in Northumberland on Saturday when the out-of-this-world event took place.
Mr Swan said it was ""ironic"" as the foursome were the only ones not to see the star when it flew overhead.
Photographer Wil Cheung said he knew he would ""never get that shot again"".
The family, from Morpeth, were at the event at the Twice Brewed Inn, near Hadrian's Wall, when Mr Cheung offered to take their picture in front of the aurora borealis display at about 21:00 GMT.
The Northern Lights could be seen at Hadrian's Wall on Saturday
Mr Swan said: ""We couldn't believe it when we saw the photo - ironically, we were the only ones in the group who didn't get to see the shooting star when it happened - but we have a pretty special photo which captured the moment forever.""
Mr Cheung, the inn's ""resident stargazer"", said: ""Getting the aurora in the background and such a beautiful shooting star travelling across the sky just at the moment the family were posing for a photo - it's amazing. I know I'll never take another shot like that again. 
""It's a real one-in-a-million stuff.""
Mr Swan, whose mother booked the stargazing session for the family as a Christmas present, said they would be getting the photo printed, framed and on the wall this week.

Petrol prices have hit another record high as oil and gas costs soar amid fears of a global economic shock from Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
Oil jumped to $139 a barrel at one point, the highest level for almost 14 years, while wholesale gas prices for next-day delivery more than doubled.
It came as the US hinted at a ban on buying Russian energy, as it looked to other countries to increase supplies.
However, European leaders rejected that idea on Monday. 
German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said Europe had ""deliberately exempted"" Russian energy from sanctions because its supply cannot be secured ""any other way"" at the moment. 
And Netherlands prime minister Mark Rutte said: ""The painful reality is we are still very much dependent on Russian gas and Russian oil and if you now force European companies to quit doing business with Russia that would have enormous ramifications around Europe including Ukraine but also around the world.
""We have to reduce our dependency. That will take time,"" he added. 
Market turmoil
UK petrol prices have hit an average of 155p a litre, the AA motoring group said.
The market turmoil is fuelling concerns that the price of many everyday items from food to petrol and heating, already rising at their fastest rate for 30 years, could be pushed higher.
Analysts have already warned that UK energy bills could reach as high as £3,000 a year due to the surge in oil and gas prices. 
Russia is the world's second top producer of crude oil after Saudi Arabia, and supplies about a third of Europe's needs. The price of Brent crude rose by more than a fifth last week amid fears of a reduction in Russian supplies.
After peaking at $139.13 a barrel early on Monday, the price of Brent crude - an international benchmark - fell back to around $125.
Ukraine war 'catastrophic for global food'
EU mulls weaponising energy in Russia crisis
The latest rise in UK petrol prices has pushed the cost to more than £7 a gallon, the AA said. Filling up a car with a 55-litre tank now costs nearly £17 more than a year ago, rising from £68.60 to £85.59.
The boss of fuel delivery firm Portland Fuel, James Spencer, told the BBC he thought fuel prices could reach £1.70-£1.75 a litre. ""Even if we can get extra [oil] supplies on to the market, nothing will happen quickly."" 
He said that, to a certain extent, individual car drivers have options to cut their use by driving less, but added that businesses that have no alternatives were really starting to feel the squeeze.
The crisis continues to affect share markets. The main stock exchanges in France and Germany sank more than 4% in early trading before paring their losses, closing 1.3% and 2% lower respectively. 
In London, the FTSE 100 dropped more than 2%, but then recovered to close 0.4% lower. Last week, the FTSE had its worse week since the start of the pandemic in March 2020.
In the US, markets ended lower with the Dow Jones and S&P 500 down 2.4% and 3% respectively. The Dow is now in a ""correction"", having fallen 10% since its last record closing level on 4 January.
The price of gold, a haven in troubled times for investors looking for security, hit $2,000 an ounce for the first time in almost 18 months.
These are massive movements in the price of commodities - the raw materials that eventually feed, warm and transport us.
The extra movements this morning arose out of talk of an embargo on Russian oil. That is very significant, because Russia is the second biggest world exporter. Anyone passing a petrol station would have seen the impact. If there was an actual embargo, the price of an average tank could head close to £100, and indeed is already there at the most expensive service stations in the UK.
But we don't need to be physically reliant on actual Russian supplies for it to feed through into the prices our suppliers pay and then pass on to us. The price for gas in international markets was already at incredible highs last week. It further increased by a third to frankly frightening levels, 10- to 15-times normal, above £6 per therm. 
If in the first half of this year these prices average £3.20, then typical dual fuel bills in October could rise to £3,000 a year or £250 a month.
On Sunday, the US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the Biden administration and its allies were discussing a ban on Russian oil supplies.
The comments came as pressure grows on the White House and other Western nations to take tougher action against Moscow over its invasion of Ukraine.
A Russian oil embargo would be a major escalation in the response to the invasion of Ukraine and would potentially have a major impact on the global economy. 
However, some European countries are reluctant given their dependence on Russian energy supplies. 
""While the US might just push through a ban on Russian oil imports, Europe can ill-afford to do the same. More worryingly, [Russian leader Vladimir] Putin, with his back to the wall, could turn off gas supplies to Europe, cutting off the continent's energy lifeline,"" said Vandana Hari at oil markets analysis firm Vanda Insights.
Mr Johnson said Europe could not simply shut down the use of oil and gas overnight, but that countries should move together quickly to look beyond Russia for its oil and gas supplies.
On Sunday, energy giant Shell defended its decision to purchase Russian crude oil despite the invasion of Ukraine.
The company said it was forced to buy oil from Russia in order to maintain timely supplies of fuel to Europe.
""To be clear, without an uninterrupted supply of crude oil to refineries, the energy industry cannot assure continued provision of essential products to people across Europe over the weeks ahead,"" a spokesperson added.
A possible ban on buying Russian oil has intensified pressure to find alternative supplies. 
The US is this week expected to press Saudi Arabia to increase crude production, and there is fresh impetus for a deal over Iran's nuclear ambitions that would lift sanctions on its oil exports.
However, progress on a deal has been hampered after Russia sought a US guarantee that the sanctions it faces over the Ukraine conflict will not affect its trade with Tehran.

Boris Johnson says no European country had done more than the UK to settle vulnerable people since 2015
Prime Minister Boris Johnson has called for a ""step-by-step"" move away from dependence on Russian oil and gas as a result of the Ukraine war.
After talks with the Canadian and Dutch PMs, Mr Johnson said nations have to work together to secure alternatives.
Canada's PM Justin Trudeau said Europe did not want to repeat its mistake of being too dependent on Russia.
But Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte warned forcing a boycott now would have ""enormous consequences"".
And in Germany, Chancellor Olaf Scholz cautioned against banning Russian oil and gas.
In a statement, he said Europe had ""deliberately exempted"" Russian energy from sanctions because its supply cannot be secured ""any other way"" at the moment.

Meanwhile, Russia warned that oil prices could surge to $300 a barrel and it might close the main gas pipeline to Germany if the West halted oil imports over the invasion of Ukraine. 
""Foregoing Russian oil will have catastrophic consequences for the world market,"" said Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak.
Mr Johnson's call came at a Downing Street news conference after he, Mr Trudeau, and Mr Rutte discussed new sanctions against Russia and aid for Ukraine.
Asked about claims that the US was in active discussions with European nations about banning imports of Russian oil, Mr Johnson said Western allies are ""moving very, very fast"" - and things which weeks ago would not have been considered are ""now very much on the table"".
He said he would set out a new energy supply strategy in the coming days, saying the UK was looking at using more of its own fossil fuels. 
But he said the UK was not abandoning its commitment to cut carbon emissions.
The UK gets less than 5% of its gas from Russia - but for EU countries the figure is about 40%.
Mr Rutte told the news conference the change would have to be ""diligent and not overnight"", combined with a faster uptake of renewable energy.
An immediate change would ""basically undermine supply chains the world over, particularly in Europe,"" he said, adding: ""It would also have an impact on Ukraine itself.""
Mr Johnson also announced a further £175m of UK support for Ukraine and Mr Trudeau said Canada would sanction 10 more Russian oligarchs and officials.
Later the prime minister joined a call with Mr Scholz, US President Joe Biden and French President Emmanuel Macron, where they said they were determined to continue raising the cost on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine.
Mr Johnson said previously unthinkable options for Western leaders were now ""very much on the table""
Western nations are facing calls to do more as Russia continues its bombardment of Ukrainian cities. 
The UK has also been criticised after it emerged that only about 50 refugees have been granted visas to enter the country as of Sunday.
During a visit to an RAF station with his fellow leaders, Mr Johnson said the UK was ""processing thousands"" and would be ""very generous"" to refugees, but would not let people in without any checks.
What sanctions are being imposed on Russia?
Will new legal powers find Putin's loot?
The government has so far announced two main schemes for people fleeing Ukraine to come to the UK - one which allows family members of people settled in the UK to join them and the other which allows organisations to sponsor a Ukrainian's entry.
Home Office sources have said they are in the early stages of exploring a scheme to provide humanitarian access to people fleeing the conflict.
But a senior government source told the BBC the focus was still on the two schemes for Ukrainian refugees that have already been announced, and the need for further action was being kept under review.
Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the Home Office was in a ""complete mess"" and the government must establish a ""simple route to sanctuary"", while Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the UK was ""not doing anywhere near enough"" to help refugees.
More than 1.5 million people have fled Ukraine since the invasion began, according to the UN refugee agency.

Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer says the Home Office is in a ""complete mess"" over how Ukrainians can get to the UK
Meanwhile, MPs are expected to vote later on the Economic Crime Bill, which aims to make it easier to sanction individuals.
In recent days, the government has announced asset freezes and travel bans on a number of oligarchs - but has faced accusations of being too slow to sanction those with links to President Putin.

The bill will set up a new register that will mean foreign owners of UK property must declare and verify their identities with Companies House. 
MPs are expected to vote through all stages of the bill in a single sitting. 
Labour said it would support the legislation, but wanted the proposed timeframe for property owners to register to be cut from six months to 28 days.

70,70,One dead after Scottish trawler capsizes off Norway,"Mon, 07 Mar 2022 09:50:30 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-60645898,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-60645898?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,Three crew members were airlifted to hospital after the Peterhead-registered Njord got into difficulty.,"One dead after trawler which sailed from Peterhead capsizes off Norway
The Njord had sailed from Peterhead
A man has died and seven crew members have been rescued after a fishing trawler capsized off Norway.
The Njord, which left Peterhead on Saturday afternoon, got into difficulty in the North Sea, about 100 nautical miles west of Stavanger.
Rescuers found the crew on the keel of the capsized boat on Sunday afternoon. 
The Norwegian Joint Rescue Co-ordination Centre (JRCC) said three who had ingested diesel were airlifted to hospital in Bergen and one later died. 
Five others were picked up by an offshore vessel, the Olympic Challenger.
The JRCC said there was no radio contact with the stricken 24m (79ft) vessel, which was previously called Courageous when it worked out of Lerwick in Shetland.
A spokesman said they were automatically alerted by the trawler's emergency position-indicating radio beacon (EPIRB), which activated when it started taking on water. 
'Sitting on the keel'
Ståle Jamtli from the JRCC told BBC Scotland the helicopter rescue was scrambled from a nearby offshore platform.
""They were there I guess after 20-something minutes,"" he said. ""When they arrived at the wreck, they saw some people sitting on the keel of the vessel - the vessel had capsized and two people I think were in the water. 
""Five of them were picked up by a nearby vessel that came to aid. The three people that were hoisted into the helicopter, they were brought to hospital in Bergen. They all had swallowed some diesel oil. The five other guys were then picked up by another helicopter and sent ashore, but they were in fairly good shape."" 
He added: ""When you consider the circumstances, I guess they were lucky because they got a really fast recovery or help because there was an offshore helicopter that close by. 
""It probably went very fast, the capsizing, because they didn't have any rescue gear or life rescue suits on them either, so they were just in normal working clothes. They would be cold. So they were lucky that they were rescued that fast.""
A major air and sea rescue operation was launched
The Olympic Challenger's captain Sven Tore Ask received the distress message. They were five nautical miles away when they set off towards the fishing boat.
They sent out a small boat and rescued five of the crew who were in the water, before giving them warm clothes, food and drink, before the rescue helicopter arrived and transported them ashore.
Shipowner Stig Remøy said: ""The crew has done a great job, where the quick action taken has clearly saved lives.""
The UK's Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) said it received a distress alert from the EPIRB at 13:49 on Sunday in the Norwegian search and rescue region.
The Norwegian Coastguard was contacted and confirmed it had also received the alert and a helicopter had been sent. 
It is believed the boat, built in 1992, sailed from Peterhead on Saturday afternoon and is registered in North Shields.
No details about the dead man or the crew members have been released.
An FCDO (Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office) spokesperson said: ""We are supporting the family of a British man following his death in Norway. We are also supporting a British man who is hospitalised in Bergen. We remain in contact with the Norwegian authorities.""

Petrol prices have hit another record high as oil and gas costs soar amid fears of a global economic shock from Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
Oil jumped to $139 a barrel at one point, the highest level for almost 14 years, while wholesale gas prices for next-day delivery more than doubled.
It came as the US hinted at a ban on buying Russian energy, as it looked to other countries to increase supplies.
However, European leaders rejected that idea on Monday. 
German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said Europe had ""deliberately exempted"" Russian energy from sanctions because its supply cannot be secured ""any other way"" at the moment. 
And Netherlands prime minister Mark Rutte said: ""The painful reality is we are still very much dependent on Russian gas and Russian oil and if you now force European companies to quit doing business with Russia that would have enormous ramifications around Europe including Ukraine but also around the world.
""We have to reduce our dependency. That will take time,"" he added. 
Market turmoil
UK petrol prices have hit an average of 155p a litre, the AA motoring group said.
The market turmoil is fuelling concerns that the price of many everyday items from food to petrol and heating, already rising at their fastest rate for 30 years, could be pushed higher.
Analysts have already warned that UK energy bills could reach as high as £3,000 a year due to the surge in oil and gas prices. 
Russia is the world's second top producer of crude oil after Saudi Arabia, and supplies about a third of Europe's needs. The price of Brent crude rose by more than a fifth last week amid fears of a reduction in Russian supplies.
After peaking at $139.13 a barrel early on Monday, the price of Brent crude - an international benchmark - fell back to around $125.
Ukraine war 'catastrophic for global food'
EU mulls weaponising energy in Russia crisis
The latest rise in UK petrol prices has pushed the cost to more than £7 a gallon, the AA said. Filling up a car with a 55-litre tank now costs nearly £17 more than a year ago, rising from £68.60 to £85.59.
The boss of fuel delivery firm Portland Fuel, James Spencer, told the BBC he thought fuel prices could reach £1.70-£1.75 a litre. ""Even if we can get extra [oil] supplies on to the market, nothing will happen quickly."" 
He said that, to a certain extent, individual car drivers have options to cut their use by driving less, but added that businesses that have no alternatives were really starting to feel the squeeze.
The crisis continues to affect share markets. The main stock exchanges in France and Germany sank more than 4% in early trading before paring their losses, closing 1.3% and 2% lower respectively. 
In London, the FTSE 100 dropped more than 2%, but then recovered to close 0.4% lower. Last week, the FTSE had its worse week since the start of the pandemic in March 2020.
In the US, markets ended lower with the Dow Jones and S&P 500 down 2.4% and 3% respectively. The Dow is now in a ""correction"", having fallen 10% since its last record closing level on 4 January.
The price of gold, a haven in troubled times for investors looking for security, hit $2,000 an ounce for the first time in almost 18 months.
These are massive movements in the price of commodities - the raw materials that eventually feed, warm and transport us.
The extra movements this morning arose out of talk of an embargo on Russian oil. That is very significant, because Russia is the second biggest world exporter. Anyone passing a petrol station would have seen the impact. If there was an actual embargo, the price of an average tank could head close to £100, and indeed is already there at the most expensive service stations in the UK.
But we don't need to be physically reliant on actual Russian supplies for it to feed through into the prices our suppliers pay and then pass on to us. The price for gas in international markets was already at incredible highs last week. It further increased by a third to frankly frightening levels, 10- to 15-times normal, above £6 per therm. 
If in the first half of this year these prices average £3.20, then typical dual fuel bills in October could rise to £3,000 a year or £250 a month.
On Sunday, the US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the Biden administration and its allies were discussing a ban on Russian oil supplies.
The comments came as pressure grows on the White House and other Western nations to take tougher action against Moscow over its invasion of Ukraine.
A Russian oil embargo would be a major escalation in the response to the invasion of Ukraine and would potentially have a major impact on the global economy. 
However, some European countries are reluctant given their dependence on Russian energy supplies. 
""While the US might just push through a ban on Russian oil imports, Europe can ill-afford to do the same. More worryingly, [Russian leader Vladimir] Putin, with his back to the wall, could turn off gas supplies to Europe, cutting off the continent's energy lifeline,"" said Vandana Hari at oil markets analysis firm Vanda Insights.
Mr Johnson said Europe could not simply shut down the use of oil and gas overnight, but that countries should move together quickly to look beyond Russia for its oil and gas supplies.
On Sunday, energy giant Shell defended its decision to purchase Russian crude oil despite the invasion of Ukraine.
The company said it was forced to buy oil from Russia in order to maintain timely supplies of fuel to Europe.
""To be clear, without an uninterrupted supply of crude oil to refineries, the energy industry cannot assure continued provision of essential products to people across Europe over the weeks ahead,"" a spokesperson added.
A possible ban on buying Russian oil has intensified pressure to find alternative supplies. 
The US is this week expected to press Saudi Arabia to increase crude production, and there is fresh impetus for a deal over Iran's nuclear ambitions that would lift sanctions on its oil exports.
However, progress on a deal has been hampered after Russia sought a US guarantee that the sanctions it faces over the Ukraine conflict will not affect its trade with Tehran.

Boris Johnson says no European country had done more than the UK to settle vulnerable people since 2015
Prime Minister Boris Johnson has called for a ""step-by-step"" move away from dependence on Russian oil and gas as a result of the Ukraine war.
After talks with the Canadian and Dutch PMs, Mr Johnson said nations have to work together to secure alternatives.
Canada's PM Justin Trudeau said Europe did not want to repeat its mistake of being too dependent on Russia.
But Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte warned forcing a boycott now would have ""enormous consequences"".
And in Germany, Chancellor Olaf Scholz cautioned against banning Russian oil and gas.
In a statement, he said Europe had ""deliberately exempted"" Russian energy from sanctions because its supply cannot be secured ""any other way"" at the moment.

Meanwhile, Russia warned that oil prices could surge to $300 a barrel and it might close the main gas pipeline to Germany if the West halted oil imports over the invasion of Ukraine. 
""Foregoing Russian oil will have catastrophic consequences for the world market,"" said Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak.
Mr Johnson's call came at a Downing Street news conference after he, Mr Trudeau, and Mr Rutte discussed new sanctions against Russia and aid for Ukraine.
Asked about claims that the US was in active discussions with European nations about banning imports of Russian oil, Mr Johnson said Western allies are ""moving very, very fast"" - and things which weeks ago would not have been considered are ""now very much on the table"".
He said he would set out a new energy supply strategy in the coming days, saying the UK was looking at using more of its own fossil fuels. 
But he said the UK was not abandoning its commitment to cut carbon emissions.
The UK gets less than 5% of its gas from Russia - but for EU countries the figure is about 40%.
Mr Rutte told the news conference the change would have to be ""diligent and not overnight"", combined with a faster uptake of renewable energy.
An immediate change would ""basically undermine supply chains the world over, particularly in Europe,"" he said, adding: ""It would also have an impact on Ukraine itself.""
Mr Johnson also announced a further £175m of UK support for Ukraine and Mr Trudeau said Canada would sanction 10 more Russian oligarchs and officials.
Later the prime minister joined a call with Mr Scholz, US President Joe Biden and French President Emmanuel Macron, where they said they were determined to continue raising the cost on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine.
Mr Johnson said previously unthinkable options for Western leaders were now ""very much on the table""
Western nations are facing calls to do more as Russia continues its bombardment of Ukrainian cities. 
The UK has also been criticised after it emerged that only about 50 refugees have been granted visas to enter the country as of Sunday.
During a visit to an RAF station with his fellow leaders, Mr Johnson said the UK was ""processing thousands"" and would be ""very generous"" to refugees, but would not let people in without any checks.
What sanctions are being imposed on Russia?
Will new legal powers find Putin's loot?
The government has so far announced two main schemes for people fleeing Ukraine to come to the UK - one which allows family members of people settled in the UK to join them and the other which allows organisations to sponsor a Ukrainian's entry.
Home Office sources have said they are in the early stages of exploring a scheme to provide humanitarian access to people fleeing the conflict.
But a senior government source told the BBC the focus was still on the two schemes for Ukrainian refugees that have already been announced, and the need for further action was being kept under review.
Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the Home Office was in a ""complete mess"" and the government must establish a ""simple route to sanctuary"", while Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the UK was ""not doing anywhere near enough"" to help refugees.
More than 1.5 million people have fled Ukraine since the invasion began, according to the UN refugee agency.

Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer says the Home Office is in a ""complete mess"" over how Ukrainians can get to the UK
Meanwhile, MPs are expected to vote later on the Economic Crime Bill, which aims to make it easier to sanction individuals.
In recent days, the government has announced asset freezes and travel bans on a number of oligarchs - but has faced accusations of being too slow to sanction those with links to President Putin.

The bill will set up a new register that will mean foreign owners of UK property must declare and verify their identities with Companies House. 
MPs are expected to vote through all stages of the bill in a single sitting. 
Labour said it would support the legislation, but wanted the proposed timeframe for property owners to register to be cut from six months to 28 days.

The Njord had sailed from Peterhead
A man has died and seven crew members have been rescued after a fishing trawler capsized off Norway.
The Njord, which left Peterhead on Saturday afternoon, got into difficulty in the North Sea, about 100 nautical miles west of Stavanger.
Rescuers found the crew on the keel of the capsized boat on Sunday afternoon. 
The Norwegian Joint Rescue Co-ordination Centre (JRCC) said three who had ingested diesel were airlifted to hospital in Bergen and one later died. 
Five others were picked up by an offshore vessel, the Olympic Challenger.
The JRCC said there was no radio contact with the stricken 24m (79ft) vessel, which was previously called Courageous when it worked out of Lerwick in Shetland.
A spokesman said they were automatically alerted by the trawler's emergency position-indicating radio beacon (EPIRB), which activated when it started taking on water. 
'Sitting on the keel'
Ståle Jamtli from the JRCC told BBC Scotland the helicopter rescue was scrambled from a nearby offshore platform.
""They were there I guess after 20-something minutes,"" he said. ""When they arrived at the wreck, they saw some people sitting on the keel of the vessel - the vessel had capsized and two people I think were in the water. 
""Five of them were picked up by a nearby vessel that came to aid. The three people that were hoisted into the helicopter, they were brought to hospital in Bergen. They all had swallowed some diesel oil. The five other guys were then picked up by another helicopter and sent ashore, but they were in fairly good shape."" 
He added: ""When you consider the circumstances, I guess they were lucky because they got a really fast recovery or help because there was an offshore helicopter that close by. 
""It probably went very fast, the capsizing, because they didn't have any rescue gear or life rescue suits on them either, so they were just in normal working clothes. They would be cold. So they were lucky that they were rescued that fast.""
A major air and sea rescue operation was launched
The Olympic Challenger's captain Sven Tore Ask received the distress message. They were five nautical miles away when they set off towards the fishing boat.
They sent out a small boat and rescued five of the crew who were in the water, before giving them warm clothes, food and drink, before the rescue helicopter arrived and transported them ashore.
Shipowner Stig Remøy said: ""The crew has done a great job, where the quick action taken has clearly saved lives.""
The UK's Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) said it received a distress alert from the EPIRB at 13:49 on Sunday in the Norwegian search and rescue region.
The Norwegian Coastguard was contacted and confirmed it had also received the alert and a helicopter had been sent. 
It is believed the boat, built in 1992, sailed from Peterhead on Saturday afternoon and is registered in North Shields.
No details about the dead man or the crew members have been released.
An FCDO (Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office) spokesperson said: ""We are supporting the family of a British man following his death in Norway. We are also supporting a British man who is hospitalised in Bergen. We remain in contact with the Norwegian authorities.""

Russian gymnast Ivan Kuliak is being investigated after wearing a national war symbol on his leotard as he stood next to a Ukrainian rival on the podium in Qatar on Saturday.
The International Gymnastics Federation (FIG) said it had opened disciplinary proceedings against Kuliak for his ""shocking behaviour"" at the Apparatus World Cup in Doha.
Kuliak earned bronze in the parallel bars final and displayed a letter 'Z' taped to his chest as he stood next to gold medal winner Illia Kovtun of Ukraine.
The letter Z has become symbolic with Russia's invasion of Ukraine and has been seen painted on the side of tanks and military vehicles, as well as being worn by pro-war politicians in Russia.
This weekend was the final opportunity for Russian and Belarusian gymnasts to compete after their countries were sanctioned by the FIG as a result of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
From Monday, Russian and Belarusian athletes, officials and judges will not be allowed to take part in FIG competitions or FIG-sanctioned competitions.

Women and children queue at Lviv station for a train to Poland. Hundred of thousands are passing through the station every day
When Svitlana Maksymenko's train pulled into the Ukrainian capital Kyiv, about halfway through her 800-mile journey from home to safety, people pushed onto every part of the carriage, she said, grasping for their own escape route west. Some abandoned their luggage. Some begged to get on. 
""They were on their knees on the platform,"" Maksymenko said. ""There was no room. There were people standing in every space, in every gangway, there were five people on every bed.""
Maksymenko's journey began in Kharkiv, an eastern city that has been heavily shelled by Russian forces, and stopped, for now, in Lviv, a picturesque western city about 50 miles from the Polish border with a grand central station that has become a waypoint for hundreds of thousands of refugees.
In almost every corner of the station concourse over the weekend, in the waiting rooms, the underpasses and all along the platforms, there were people taking shelter, sleeping, anxiously waiting, rushing for trains. There were tense moments as volunteer stewards tried to hold back the crowds of people massed at entry gates, fearful of missing their chance to escape. Women with children wept with the stress, clutching their passports and family birth certificates in one hand and their children in the other. Outside the station, there were tearful goodbyes as fighting-age men, banned from leaving Ukraine, stopped and let their families go, unsure if they would ever see them again.   
There were tense moments as stewards attempted to hold back crowds anxious to make the trains
By the time she reached Lviv, Maksymenko had been on the train with her parents-in-law and three-year-old daughter for 26 hours. Some reported longer journeys. Maksymenko was a drop in a river of people that began flowing into Lviv when Russia invaded and swelled over the past few days as Russian forces escalated their campaign of bombing against Ukrainian civilians. 
""We estimate 30,000 people arrived on Thursday, 100,000 people on Friday and at least a 100,000 more on Saturday,"" said Viktoria Khrystenko, a Lviv city council official helping to manage the influx of refugees.
""We are doing our best to cope but we have never seen anything like this,"" she said. ""We are expecting more people. It might be millions. It's a disaster. These people have nothing, just one bag because they had only three minutes to run and save their lives.""
Lviv station was heaving with people on Friday night, thinning only slightly as trains departed for Poland before filling again with new arrivals from the bombed-out cities in the north, east, and south of Ukraine. 
Outside, Kolya, 46, was standing with tears streaming down his face, watching his wife and two teenage daughters walk away from him.
""I hope they will make it safely to Europe, I want so badly to be with them,"" he said. ""This is as far as I can go.""
Ukraine has banned men aged 16-60 from leaving the country, unless they have a disability or three children under 18. They are stopped in document checks at the station or at border crossing points further west. Kolya had stood for 10 hours on the train from Kyiv to ensure his family reached Lviv safely, he said, and now he would make the same journey back to join his 19-year-old son and his brothers in the fight against Russia.  
""I will go back to Kyiv and defend my city. It is my home,"" he said. ""How, I don't know - I have asked them for a gun, but how will I protect my city from missiles with a gun?""
Poland's government began sending buses over the weekend to bring Ukraine's refugees over the border to safety.
Kolya's wife and children would press on to Poland, whose government has sent trains and buses to bring people from Ukraine into its country, sparing tens of thousands of refugees traumatic journeys to the border and long waits to cross by foot. 
By Sunday, more than 1.5 million Ukrainians had crossed into Poland, according to the UN. Hundreds of thousands more were on the move inside Ukraine.
Amid the chaos in the station at Lviv, volunteers and fellow travellers helped the very young and the very old, carrying pushchairs and suitcases up and down the stairs to the platforms, marshalling children to rooms upstairs where they could get a hot meal, and helping the elderly wherever they could.
""Physically it was very hard for me of course, people were pushing very hard,"" said Dusia Kostiuk, 91, who boarded a train in Kharkiv at 9pm on Friday, arrived in Lviv at midnight on Saturday, and spent the next 15 hours in a queue at the station to move on Poland.
""Our house was still there when we left but shelling was happening all around and we were told that terrible shelling is happening there now,"" Kostiuk said. 
""We didn't take anything with us, I took two dresses and that's it. 
""I was born and raised in Kharkiv. I didn't really travel before, I don't like to travel. I never thought I would leave my home like this."" 
Dusia Kostiuk, 91, spent 27 hours on a train from the heavily bombed city of Kharkiv to Lviv.
Many of those arriving in Lviv, like Kostiuk, stay in the station until they can board a train to Poland - some bedding down for a night or longer in any free corner. The air inside the grand waiting rooms and gangways was thick with the heat and odour of a mass of people who have been on the move for many days. 
Those who cannot move straight on to Poland head out into the city looking for temporary shelter. At a small theatre in Lviv's historic old town, 20 beds had been arranged for those who needed to spend up to three nights in the city before they can leave. 
Olha Adamenko, 32, arrived there on Sunday evening with her husband and sick two-year-old daughter. They had driven over four days from Kyiv, stopping in shelters along the way. But the shelter in the theatre was already at capacity and it was not clear whether there was going to be a bed there for her that night, the staff said. 
It was a problem many would face that night, according to Khyrstenko, the city official, who said all of the roughly 20,000 temporary beds in the city were already taken. 
At the theatre, Adam Yemchenko, a volunteer, was preparing to turn people away. ""Most people arrive later than this but people getting to us tonight won't get a bed, we will have to send them somewhere else,"" he said. 
""Some will carry straight on to the border but they face an eight hour wait there in the cold.""
Refugees rest in a shelter in a small theatre in Lviv. By early evening on Sunday the shelter was full and turning people away.
This was the choice facing Adamenko, as she sat down inside the small theatre foyer looking tired and stressed. She stopped to breastfeed her daughter, who was restless and tearful. Her husband would soon have to leave them here in Lviv and travel back to Kyiv to join the territorial defence forces. 
She asked the volunteers at the shelter how to reach the Polish border by bus and which were the best border crossings. 
""Maybe we will go tonight,"" she said. But she was worried, there were long queues at the crossing points and it was the depth of winter. 
""I heard people are queuing outside there during the day but at night locals take them into their homes, but I don't know if it is true,"" she said. ""I am worried about the baby, she is sick and tired.""
Adamenko was also starting to worry more about her husband. She thought their local defence battalion on the outskirts of Kyiv would be relatively safe, but heavy fighting surrounded it over the weekend in the districts of Bucha and Irpin. 
""Maybe that means the Russians will go through our neighbourhood next,"" she said.
A young boy leaves Ukraine on a bus bound for Poland. Thousands of children have spent hours away from home.
As night fell, Adamenko and her husband left the theatre and walked into Lviv with directions to another shelter, where if she could find a bed they would part - one on to safety abroad, one back to danger at home.
Later on Sunday night, at the station, many thousands more people were still arriving and departing. They formed queues that were as orderly as possible under the circumstances and continued to help each other. Volunteers bustled through the crowds with trays made from cardboard boxes, handing out tea and snacks in plastic cups.
At the same time, Viktoria Khrystenko, the city council official, was driving her own three children to the Polish border. They had left on Sunday morning and by early Monday morning they had been in the car nearly 24 hours through the bitterly cold night.
Eventually they crossed in to Poland and Khrystenko left her children with relatives and began the long return journey to Lviv. As she drove, she wept. 
""I'm sorry, I'm emotional because I didn't sleep at all,"" she said. ""I had a task to take my kids to a safe place across the border and I have done that, so now I need to go back to Lviv and continue to help.""
Khrystenko was born here in Lviv. She had never been more proud of its people, she said. They were ""ready to give away their last package of buckwheat or can of food"" to help others. ""We have only one Ukraine and we need to save it,"" she said.
She hung up and drove on, headed for her three-room apartment in the city, where there were 17 women and children from all over Ukraine resting after long journeys to Lviv. She had taken home as many people from the station as she could, she said.
Outside Lviv station fire barrels were lit during the night to keep the crowds warm

80,80,How many refugees have fled Ukraine and where are they going?,"Mon, 07 Mar 2022 10:04:55 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-60555472,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-60555472?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,The EU says up to four million people may try to escape the war in Ukraine.,"How many Ukrainian refugees are there and where have they gone?
At least 12 million people have fled their homes since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the United Nations (UN) says. 
More than five million have left for neighbouring countries, while seven million people are still thought to be displaced inside Ukraine itself. 
However, hundreds of thousands of refugees have returned to their home country - especially to cities like Kyiv.
Where are refugees going?
The UN says that, as of 4 July, external, more than 5.2 million refugees from Ukraine have been recorded across Europe. More than 3.5 million have applied for temporary residence in another country: 
Russia: (estimated) 1,412,425 Ukrainian refugees recorded
Poland: 1,194,642 
Moldova: 82,700
Romania: 83,321
Slovakia: 79,770
Hungary: 25,800
Belarus: 9,820 
Others have moved on to other countries, especially those who crossed into Poland, Hungary and Slovakia. These nations have open borders with other EU states, external. 
The UN says there are more than 867,000 Ukrainians in Germany, almost 382,768 in the Czech Republic and 141,562 in Italy. 
Some Ukrainians travelled to Russia from the regions of Luhansk and Donetsk, which are now mostly in the hands of pro-Russian separatist forces. 
President Vladimir Putin said his forces evacuated 140,000 civilians from Mariupol, external and insisted none of them was forced to go to Russia. However, volunteer groups, external say they have helped thousands of Ukrainians leave Russia.
What help are countries offering refugees?
The EU has granted Ukrainians the automatic right to stay and work throughout its 27 member nations for up to three years. 
Refugees are housed in reception centres if they can't stay with friends or relatives. They are given food and medical care, and information about onward travel.
They are entitled to social welfare payments and access to housing, medical treatment and schools.
Poland, one of the countries which has taken the highest number of refugees, and Moldova, which has the largest concentration of refugees by population, have asked for additional support. 
Hundreds of refugees were housed in this athletics centre in Moldova
How many people are returning to Ukraine?
The UN says that as of 21 June, there have been over 3 million ""cross-border movements"" back into Ukraine, external, but says this number does not refer to individual refugees.
Ukraine's border force had previously said people were crossing back into the country at a rate of about 30,000 a day.
Some are returning to areas of Ukraine such as the capital Kyiv, which were threatened by Russian army advances at the start of the war, but which are now considered safer. 
In May, Kyiv mayor Vitali Klitschko said the city's population was back to two-thirds of its pre-war level, external. 
Where are people fleeing inside Ukraine?
The UN's International Organisation for Migration (IOM) said in May that more than seven million people remain internally displaced, external:
27% of refugees were from the Kharkiv region
16% from Kyiv 
16% from the Donetsk region in eastern Ukraine
24% indicated their homes had been damaged or attacked in the war
The IOM estimates that more than half of the people who are internally displaced are women. Many are particularly vulnerable because they are pregnant or have small children, have a disability or are a victim of violence.
The UN is working alongside other organisations to provide cash, food and other supplies. 
The UN estimates that about eight million people are displaced inside Ukraine
What is the UK doing to help Ukrainian refugees?
The UK introduced a family visa scheme, external for Ukrainians who have an immediate or extended family member in the UK.
After the government response was criticised, it launched the Homes for Ukraine scheme to allow those without relatives in the UK to settle. 
People in the UK can nominate an individual or family to stay with them rent-free for at least six months.
Refugees who come via the scheme can live and work in the UK for up to three years, and get access to healthcare, welfare and schools.
Applications are made online, external, and both hosts and refugees are vetted. Hosts receive £350 a month.
Many families who have applied to be sponsors have complained that the system is too slow and complicated.
As of 28 June, the government had issued 142,500 Ukrainian visas, external out of 161,500 applications received, and as of 27 June, 86,600 visa holders had arrived in the UK.

Racheal Diyaolu has been taking cover in her university's bunker since the Russian invasion
An Irish medical student is attempting to leave Ukraine after sheltering for days from airstrikes and shelling in the eastern town of Sumy.
Racheal Diyaolu, who is 19 and from Carlow, was among hundreds of international students in the city close to Ukraine's border with Russia.
Sumy has been under attack by Russia since its invasion started last month.
Racheal told BBC News NI she had been mentally ""blocking out"" the dangers she faced.
It is understood she left Sumy on Monday after she was picked up by two Scottish men attempting a rescue who her family had been in contact with.
Her sister, Christiana, said she had passed safely through a number of checkpoints and was staying overnight at a ""safe stopover location"" before a curfew begins.
""The relief just knowing that they're safe and sheltered,"" she told BBC Radio Ulster's Evening Extra programme.
""We're hoping for the best now.""
A previous rescue effort failed on Sunday when a minivan used by the men was targeted by ""warning shots"" from Russian forces as they tried to enter Sumy, Racheal said.
However, they managed to reach an agreed pick-up location on Monday morning.
Change of plans
On Monday night, Racheal said that the group planned to head for Moldova on Tuesday.
""Hopefully we'll be able to get to the border and find our way through, and get home soon,"" she said in a video, posted on Twitter.

Earlier, she had told RTÉ's Morning Ireland programme they hoped to travel in the direction of Poland, a journey which could take up to 20 hours.
She was not sure if they could make use of humanitarian corridors. 
""I have left behind lots of friends who are still stuck there and still looking for ways to get out, and most of my belongings as well,"" she explained.
""I'm fine, just trying to stay in high spirits and keep positive that we'll make it to Poland.""
Christiana said the Scottish men had their phones seized during the attack on Sunday before being told to turn back.
""Luckily they were able to find an alternative route into Sumy and stayed there overnight and then continued their mission this morning,"" she added.
Racheal has been studying in Ukraine since November
The Irish Department of Foreign Affairs told BBC News NI it was aware of 52 Irish citizens remaining in Ukraine.
On Sunday, UN monitors said 364 civilian deaths had been confirmed in Ukraine since the invasion began on 24 February, but the real figure was likely to be ""considerably higher"".
Ms Diyaolu arrived in the country from the Republic of Ireland for her studies last November.
Since the invasion started, she has been taking cover in her university's bunker when air raid sirens have sounded.
""Someone will come and knock on your door on all the floors to let them know that it's time to go down and take cover, bring your essentials and your documents,"" she told BBC News NI before her latest attempt to leave Sumy.
The Ukrainian deputy prime minister has said Russia is striking civilian targets in Ukraine, including hospitals, nurseries, and schools.

IN DEPTH: Full coverage of the conflict
At the beginning of the invasion, Russian tanks and troops poured into Ukraine at points along its borders including northern regions such as Sumy. 
Ms Diyaolu said it had been ""an out-of-body experience"" to know there is such danger outside.
""I've had to train my mind to block out the fact that this is incoming danger,"" she told BBC News NI.
""It does happen so frequently at this point that you kind of don't have time to be afraid any more.""
Russian forces have been heavily shelling towns outside the capital of Kyiv
The student said things had become quite difficult in Sumy, ""especially for people who are trying to get out"".
""It's been quite hard going, we've had a lot of air strike threats, we've had quite a few bombs being dropped,"" she said.
'I haven't lost hope'
The medical student said she had tried to ""hold on to hope"" that she would be able to get home.
""It's especially hard on my mother, she's just worried to death all day every day, trying to get in contact with me,"" she said.
""The best thing I can do is stay calm when I am talking to her, letting her know that I'm OK.
""I know that I'm in a scary situation and in a dangerous area, but letting her know that I'm OK, mentally and physically, and that my mind is with them at home and my mind is focused on staying safe and trying to find ways to get out.""
Ms Diyaolu's family have been calling for more help from the Irish government to bring the 19-year-old home.
Ireland's Department of Foreign Affairs said it could not comment on specific cases, but confirmed it was in contact with Irish citizens in Ukraine.
It has advised people to ""shelter in a secure place"" or, if it is safe to do so, to ""consider leaving Ukraine, depending on their location and prevailing circumstances"".

82,82,Ukraine: India doctor stranded with a jaguar and panther,"Mon, 07 Mar 2022 04:48:02 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-60637980,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-60637980?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,"Girikumar Patil, who bought two big cats, said he will not leave home without his pets.","Ukraine: India doctor stranded with a jaguar and panther
Girikumar Patil bought a jaguar and a panther from a zoo 20 months ago
For more than a week, an Indian-born doctor in war-torn Ukraine has been holed up in a basement at home with his pet big cats - a black panther and a jaguar. 
Gidikumar Patil, who bought the two cats from the Kyiv zoo, says he will not leave home without his pets. He has lived for over six years in Severodonetsk, a small town located in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine. 
After the war began, Mr Patil, who is single, has been stepping out of his cramped basement only to buy food for his cats - the male jaguar is 20 months old and the female panther is a six-month-old cub - after the curfew ends early in the morning. (The jaguar is a rare hybrid between a male leopard and a female jaguar, he said.) 
How Ukraine's animals are being rescued in war
Weapons now a part of everyday family life
So far, Mr Patil said he had bought 23kg of sheep, turkey and chicken meat from neighbouring villages at prices four times higher than normal. 
""My big cats have been spending nights in the basement with me. There has been a lot of bombing happening around us. The cats are scared. They are eating less. I can't leave them,"" Mr Patil, 40, told the BBC. 
""This is the second war I am living through. But this is scarier.""
Mr Patil said he was earlier living in Luhansk, where Russian-backed rebels have been fighting Ukrainian troops since 2014 despite a ceasefire agreement. During the fighting in the region, his home and an Indian restaurant he opened in the area were destroyed, he said.
Ukrainian military forces walk in the small town of Severodonetsk, where Mr Patil lives
He then moved to Severodonetsk, about 100km (62 miles) away, bought a new place, began practising medicine and bought his new pets. 
""Now I am stuck in a war zone. This time I am really worried. My parents have been calling me and asking me to come home, but I can't leave the animals,"" Mr Patil said. 
Mr Patil, who hails from the southern Indian state of Andhra Pradesh, said that he spent $35,000 (£26,460) to buy the panther and the jaguar from the Kyiv zoo about 20 months ago. He said the zoo allowed private sales of animals provided the owner had enough space to keep them - Mr Patil showed the birth certificates of the animals supplied by the zoo.
Mr Patil said he arrived in Ukraine in 2007 to study medicine. Since 2014, he has been a practising orthopaedic doctor and now works in a government hospital in Severodonetsk which was shut after the war began. He said he also does private practice. 
Mr Patil says he will not return to India without his pets
In Severodonetsk, Mr Patil lives in a six-room two-storey house with a small enclosure for the animals. He said he spent most of his earnings on his pets - he also has three dogs - and tries to raise additional funds through his YouTube channels, external where he posts videos of his two big cats for some 85,000 subscribers.
""I have always been fascinated with big cats since watching my favourite southern Indian film star, Chiranjeevi, in a film with leopards,"" he said.
The son of a bank manager father and a school teacher, Mr Patil said he has always been an ""animal lover"", and kept dogs, cats and birds at home.
After high school and college, Mr Patil also dabbled in acting, doing small parts in Telugu soaps. In Ukraine, he said, he had done parts as a ""foreign"" character in half-a-dozen local films and series.
The border with Russia was barely 80km from home, Mr Patil said, but it was difficult to reach there because of Russian forces in the region. There had been intermittent power cuts and internet breakdowns in his neighbourhood, but he was able to post video messages on social media regularly.
""I am the only Indian out here, and at night I am alone in the neighbourhood. Most of my neighbours have moved to nearby villages. I am going to hold out,"" he said.

The monarch greeted Canada's Justin Trudeau with a handshake
The Queen posed in front of blue and yellow flowers, the national colours of Ukraine, as she held her first in-person meeting at Windsor Castle since falling ill with Covid.
On whether this was a symbolic show of support, a Royal source indicated it was unlikely to be accidental.
The 95-year-old monarch was pictured smiling warmly at the Canadian PM as he held her right hand in both of his.
Justin Trudeau was visiting for talks with the UK PM about the Ukraine war.
The monarch, who is also Queen of Canada, tested positive for Covid-19 on 20 February and has carried out only ""light duties"" since then, cancelling several events. 
She carried out her first virtual engagements on 1 March before Monday's face-to-face meeting.

During the audience at Windsor Castle's Oak Room, Mr Trudeau was also pictured laughing as the Queen gestured towards herself.
The Queen was not seen with the walking stick which she has been using recently.
Asked later at a Downing Street news conference about his meeting with the monarch, Mr Trudeau said: ""She was as insightful and perspicacious as ever, very interested in what is going on, asked me all sorts of questions about Canada.
""We had a really useful - for me anyway - conversation about global events, as we always do.""
As well as this gesture of support for Ukraine at the meeting, the Queen previously made a donation to the Disasters Emergency Committee appeal to help people fleeing the conflict in Ukraine.
She has two high-profile events scheduled in the coming weeks: the Commonwealth Service on 14 March and the Duke of Edinburgh's memorial service on 29 March, both at Westminster Abbey.
Last month, she reached her Platinum Jubilee after 70 years on the throne.

85,85,Ukraine conflict: Petrol at fresh record as oil and gas prices soar,"Mon, 07 Mar 2022 15:47:46 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-60642786,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-60642786?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,"Investors fear a global economic shock, with rising fuel bills causing more pain for households.","Ukraine conflict: Petrol at fresh record as oil and gas prices soar
Petrol prices have hit another record high as oil and gas costs soar amid fears of a global economic shock from Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
Oil jumped to $139 a barrel at one point, the highest level for almost 14 years, while wholesale gas prices for next-day delivery more than doubled.
It came as the US hinted at a ban on buying Russian energy, as it looked to other countries to increase supplies.
However, European leaders rejected that idea on Monday. 
German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said Europe had ""deliberately exempted"" Russian energy from sanctions because its supply cannot be secured ""any other way"" at the moment. 
And Netherlands prime minister Mark Rutte said: ""The painful reality is we are still very much dependent on Russian gas and Russian oil and if you now force European companies to quit doing business with Russia that would have enormous ramifications around Europe including Ukraine but also around the world.
""We have to reduce our dependency. That will take time,"" he added. 
Market turmoil
UK petrol prices have hit an average of 155p a litre, the AA motoring group said.
The market turmoil is fuelling concerns that the price of many everyday items from food to petrol and heating, already rising at their fastest rate for 30 years, could be pushed higher.
Analysts have already warned that UK energy bills could reach as high as £3,000 a year due to the surge in oil and gas prices. 
Russia is the world's second top producer of crude oil after Saudi Arabia, and supplies about a third of Europe's needs. The price of Brent crude rose by more than a fifth last week amid fears of a reduction in Russian supplies.
After peaking at $139.13 a barrel early on Monday, the price of Brent crude - an international benchmark - fell back to around $125.
Ukraine war 'catastrophic for global food'
EU mulls weaponising energy in Russia crisis
The latest rise in UK petrol prices has pushed the cost to more than £7 a gallon, the AA said. Filling up a car with a 55-litre tank now costs nearly £17 more than a year ago, rising from £68.60 to £85.59.
The boss of fuel delivery firm Portland Fuel, James Spencer, told the BBC he thought fuel prices could reach £1.70-£1.75 a litre. ""Even if we can get extra [oil] supplies on to the market, nothing will happen quickly."" 
He said that, to a certain extent, individual car drivers have options to cut their use by driving less, but added that businesses that have no alternatives were really starting to feel the squeeze.
The crisis continues to affect share markets. The main stock exchanges in France and Germany sank more than 4% in early trading before paring their losses, closing 1.3% and 2% lower respectively. 
In London, the FTSE 100 dropped more than 2%, but then recovered to close 0.4% lower. Last week, the FTSE had its worse week since the start of the pandemic in March 2020.
In the US, markets ended lower with the Dow Jones and S&P 500 down 2.4% and 3% respectively. The Dow is now in a ""correction"", having fallen 10% since its last record closing level on 4 January.
The price of gold, a haven in troubled times for investors looking for security, hit $2,000 an ounce for the first time in almost 18 months.
These are massive movements in the price of commodities - the raw materials that eventually feed, warm and transport us.
The extra movements this morning arose out of talk of an embargo on Russian oil. That is very significant, because Russia is the second biggest world exporter. Anyone passing a petrol station would have seen the impact. If there was an actual embargo, the price of an average tank could head close to £100, and indeed is already there at the most expensive service stations in the UK.
But we don't need to be physically reliant on actual Russian supplies for it to feed through into the prices our suppliers pay and then pass on to us. The price for gas in international markets was already at incredible highs last week. It further increased by a third to frankly frightening levels, 10- to 15-times normal, above £6 per therm. 
If in the first half of this year these prices average £3.20, then typical dual fuel bills in October could rise to £3,000 a year or £250 a month.
On Sunday, the US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the Biden administration and its allies were discussing a ban on Russian oil supplies.
The comments came as pressure grows on the White House and other Western nations to take tougher action against Moscow over its invasion of Ukraine.
A Russian oil embargo would be a major escalation in the response to the invasion of Ukraine and would potentially have a major impact on the global economy. 
However, some European countries are reluctant given their dependence on Russian energy supplies. 
""While the US might just push through a ban on Russian oil imports, Europe can ill-afford to do the same. More worryingly, [Russian leader Vladimir] Putin, with his back to the wall, could turn off gas supplies to Europe, cutting off the continent's energy lifeline,"" said Vandana Hari at oil markets analysis firm Vanda Insights.
Mr Johnson said Europe could not simply shut down the use of oil and gas overnight, but that countries should move together quickly to look beyond Russia for its oil and gas supplies.
On Sunday, energy giant Shell defended its decision to purchase Russian crude oil despite the invasion of Ukraine.
The company said it was forced to buy oil from Russia in order to maintain timely supplies of fuel to Europe.
""To be clear, without an uninterrupted supply of crude oil to refineries, the energy industry cannot assure continued provision of essential products to people across Europe over the weeks ahead,"" a spokesperson added.
A possible ban on buying Russian oil has intensified pressure to find alternative supplies. 
The US is this week expected to press Saudi Arabia to increase crude production, and there is fresh impetus for a deal over Iran's nuclear ambitions that would lift sanctions on its oil exports.
However, progress on a deal has been hampered after Russia sought a US guarantee that the sanctions it faces over the Ukraine conflict will not affect its trade with Tehran.

""It was certainly a start and I have been quite busy ever since,"" she said. ""You get your lulls in work and that makes you all the more grateful when the next job comes along and all the more determined to give it your best.""

Ed Sheeran gave evidence at the High Court on Monday
Ed Sheeran has told the High Court he does not ""borrow"" ideas from unknown songwriters without credit.
The singer-songwriter has been accused by two other songwriters of copying parts of his 2017 hit Shape Of You.
Sami Chokri and Ross O'Donoghue's barrister suggested Sheeran treated lesser-known songwriters differently from famous ones.
Sheeran denied this, telling the court he had cleared parts of songs with ""lots"" of unknown artists.
Shape of You was number one for 14 weeks in the UK in 2017, becoming the best-selling song of the year around the world.

Chokri and O'Donoghue claim the song's ""Oh I"" hook is ""strikingly similar"" to part of their track Oh Why, which was released by Chokri under the name Sami Switch in 2015.

On Friday, their barrister Andrew Sutcliffe QC claimed Sheeran ""borrows ideas and throws them into his songs, sometimes he will acknowledge it but sometimes he won't"".
But Sheeran denied the claim that he is a ""magpie"" who lifts other people's work without acknowledgment, pointing out that he has often shared credit with lesser-known artists, including Shivers and Visiting Hours, and a song that sampled an ""unknown composer's"" work from Buffy The Vampire Slayer.
""All those examples are not famous artists that we've cleared songs with and that's what I have to say on that,"" he told the court.

Sheeran created Shape of You with co-writers Steve Mac - real name Steven McCutcheon - and Snow Patrol's Johnny McDaid, both of whom were also in court.
After its release, Sheeran added the team behind TLC's 1999 single No Scrubs to the song's writing credits after some commentators pointed out similarities.
On Monday, Mr Sutcliffe told the star: ""The evidence is overwhelming that at the time of writing Shape of You, your songwriting process involved collecting ideas.""
Sheeran replied: ""You say it's overwhelming, I don't agree with that.""
'Completely fair'
In written evidence, the singer said the contested element of Shape of You was ""very short"", and the relevant parts of both songs were ""entirely commonplace"".
He said: ""Even so, if I had heard Oh Why at the time and had referenced it, I would have taken steps to clear it.""
He added: ""I have always tried to be completely fair in crediting anyone who makes any contribution to any song I write.
""I do refer to other works on occasion when I write, as do many songwriters. If there is a reference to another work, I notify my team so that steps can be taken to obtain clearance.
""I have been as scrupulous as I possibly can and have even given credits to people who I believe may have been no more than a mere influence for a songwriting element. This is because I want to treat other songwriters fairly.""
Dressed in a sharp black suit, Ed Sheeran is firm, determined and just a little bit irritated on the stand as lawyers for Chokri and O'Donoghue deconstruct his songwriting process, looking for hints that he might take inspiration from outside sources.
Sheeran testifies that he mostly works in collaboration with other writers, and that it's often hard to identify who has written each individual part of a song once it's finished.
Referencing his Shape of You co-writer Johnny McDaid, he says: ""My and Johnny's writing partnership is very much like a game of tennis. He'll say something and I'll say something back. We're quite quick when we go back and forth.""
Asked repeatedly whether he is responsible for the chorus to his 2015 song Photograph, Sheeran replies tersely: ""I honestly couldn't tell you. I don't know. We wrote the song together."" It's a phrase he returns to several times throughout the morning's questioning.
Photograph is relevant because it was the subject of a separate copyright claim from Martin Harrington and Thomas Leonard, who wrote Matt Cardle's 2011 single Amazing. The duo were eventually given a share of the song's royalties and a £4m lump sum in an out-of-court settlement.
Sheeran says he settled the claim because it was a ""nuisance"" and ""more trouble than it was worth"". Asked why he would pay out such a ""substantial"" sum instead of taking the case to court, he says he did so on the advice of his lawyers.
Mr Sutcliffe said Sheeran had known about Chokri before Shape Of You was written because the grime artist had tweeted Sheeran directly, and the singer had given a shout out to Sami Switch on stage in 2011. But Sheeran replied: ""This isn't stuff that's true.""
Chokri had also appeared on YouTube channel SBTV at around the same time as Sheeran, who described its founder Jamal Edwards as his ""best friend"".
But he said the music entrepreneur, who died last month, didn't share songs like Oh Why with him. Instead, the pair would ""talk about football, talk about his mum, talk about theatre"", he said.
Sheeran was also asked about his role as a talent-spotter for his own label Gingerbread Man Records. He denied being aware of Oh Why, saying he had just signed Jamie Lawson to the label and ""wasn't looking for anyone else"" to work with.
The musician told the court he quit social media in 2015, adding that for ""the whole of 2016"" he was ""off"" social media and was using a ""flip phone from Tesco"".
In May 2018, Sheeran and his co-writers issued proceedings asking the High Court to declare they had not infringed Chokri and O'Donoghue's copyright.
The pair then issued a counter claim for copyright infringement. The trial is expected to continue for about three weeks.

The chart-topping rapper had denied assault by beating
Grime artist Dizzee Rascal has been found guilty of assaulting his former partner.
The rapper, whose real name is Dylan Kwabena Mills, attacked Cassandra Jones at a property in Streatham, south London, in June 2021.
The 37-year-old, of Sevenoaks, Kent, ""barged"" his way into the house, put his forehead against Ms Jones' and ""pushed her to the ground"".
The couple had two children before they split up in February 2021.
At Wimbledon Magistrates' Court on Monday, the musician - whose chart-topping singles have included Bonkers and Dance Wiv Me - had denied assault by beating.
The court heard Mills ""barged"" his way into the property on 8 June, with his son under his arms before ""screaming and shouting"" and banging his own head on the fridge three times.
He then approached Ms Jones, ""put his forehead against hers and pushed her around the room"" and then ""pushed her to the ground"", the court heard.
He had accused her of causing injuries to his arm.
The grime artist was made an MBE for services to music in the Queen's Birthday Honours in 2020
The court heard how Ms Jones began filming him but he took her phone from her and then took the phone from her mother, Dawn Kirk, who was there.
The shouting became so loud it alerted two neighbours and police were called.
When they arrived, Mills said ""I'm the aggressor"", but later gave a prepared statement in a police interview, denying the allegations and claimed he had been assaulted by Ms Jones, the court heard.
Delivering her verdict, District Judge Polly Gledhill said Mills had lost his temper in an argument over child contact and finances.
She added he was ""abusive and aggressive"" and ""assaulted her as outlined by the Crown"".
Following the verdict, Mills took a camera from a Press Association photographer outside the court and threw it into a road, smashing it.
A Press Association photographer said Mills smashed his camera outside court
Photographer, James Manning, said: ""He came out of the court, I was taking his picture, just standing still on the corner.
""He then pushed my camera into my face, which then caused it to fall to the floor, at which point he then picked it up and then threw it across the road. It smashed into a lot of pieces.
""He was angry, he came straight out of the door, didn't say anything, didn't say anything until the point at which he pushed my camera.
""I think he said something like 'get away' or 'get out of my face' or something along those lines.""
Det Con Hannah Barton said she wanted to ""praise the woman who Mills assaulted - she has shown immense strength throughout this investigation"".
""No woman should be subjected to violence of any form and I would urge anyone who finds themselves in this position to trust police - we will investigate and you will be provided with the support you need to help you through,"" she added.
Mills released his debut album, Boy In Da Corner, in 2003, and is due to release his seventh album later this year.
In 2020, he was made an MBE for services to music in the Queen's Birthday Honours.
He will be sentenced at Croydon Magistrates' Court on 8 April.

Boris Johnson says no European country had done more than the UK to settle vulnerable people since 2015
Prime Minister Boris Johnson has called for a ""step-by-step"" move away from dependence on Russian oil and gas as a result of the Ukraine war.
After talks with the Canadian and Dutch PMs, Mr Johnson said nations have to work together to secure alternatives.
Canada's PM Justin Trudeau said Europe did not want to repeat its mistake of being too dependent on Russia.
But Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte warned forcing a boycott now would have ""enormous consequences"".
And in Germany, Chancellor Olaf Scholz cautioned against banning Russian oil and gas.
In a statement, he said Europe had ""deliberately exempted"" Russian energy from sanctions because its supply cannot be secured ""any other way"" at the moment.

Meanwhile, Russia warned that oil prices could surge to $300 a barrel and it might close the main gas pipeline to Germany if the West halted oil imports over the invasion of Ukraine. 
""Foregoing Russian oil will have catastrophic consequences for the world market,"" said Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak.
Mr Johnson's call came at a Downing Street news conference after he, Mr Trudeau, and Mr Rutte discussed new sanctions against Russia and aid for Ukraine.
Asked about claims that the US was in active discussions with European nations about banning imports of Russian oil, Mr Johnson said Western allies are ""moving very, very fast"" - and things which weeks ago would not have been considered are ""now very much on the table"".
He said he would set out a new energy supply strategy in the coming days, saying the UK was looking at using more of its own fossil fuels. 
But he said the UK was not abandoning its commitment to cut carbon emissions.
The UK gets less than 5% of its gas from Russia - but for EU countries the figure is about 40%.
Mr Rutte told the news conference the change would have to be ""diligent and not overnight"", combined with a faster uptake of renewable energy.
An immediate change would ""basically undermine supply chains the world over, particularly in Europe,"" he said, adding: ""It would also have an impact on Ukraine itself.""
Mr Johnson also announced a further £175m of UK support for Ukraine and Mr Trudeau said Canada would sanction 10 more Russian oligarchs and officials.
Later the prime minister joined a call with Mr Scholz, US President Joe Biden and French President Emmanuel Macron, where they said they were determined to continue raising the cost on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine.
Mr Johnson said previously unthinkable options for Western leaders were now ""very much on the table""
Western nations are facing calls to do more as Russia continues its bombardment of Ukrainian cities. 
The UK has also been criticised after it emerged that only about 50 refugees have been granted visas to enter the country as of Sunday.
During a visit to an RAF station with his fellow leaders, Mr Johnson said the UK was ""processing thousands"" and would be ""very generous"" to refugees, but would not let people in without any checks.
What sanctions are being imposed on Russia?
Will new legal powers find Putin's loot?
The government has so far announced two main schemes for people fleeing Ukraine to come to the UK - one which allows family members of people settled in the UK to join them and the other which allows organisations to sponsor a Ukrainian's entry.
Home Office sources have said they are in the early stages of exploring a scheme to provide humanitarian access to people fleeing the conflict.
But a senior government source told the BBC the focus was still on the two schemes for Ukrainian refugees that have already been announced, and the need for further action was being kept under review.
Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the Home Office was in a ""complete mess"" and the government must establish a ""simple route to sanctuary"", while Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the UK was ""not doing anywhere near enough"" to help refugees.
More than 1.5 million people have fled Ukraine since the invasion began, according to the UN refugee agency.

Meanwhile, MPs are expected to vote later on the Economic Crime Bill, which aims to make it easier to sanction individuals.
In recent days, the government has announced asset freezes and travel bans on a number of oligarchs - but has faced accusations of being too slow to sanction those with links to President Putin.

90,90,One dead after trawler which sailed from Peterhead capsizes off Norway,"Mon, 07 Mar 2022 15:26:57 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-60645898,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-60645898?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,Three crew were flown to hospital after being found on the keel of the boat which sailed from Peterhead.,"One dead after trawler which sailed from Peterhead capsizes off Norway
The Njord had sailed from Peterhead
A man has died and seven crew members have been rescued after a fishing trawler capsized off Norway.
The Njord, which left Peterhead on Saturday afternoon, got into difficulty in the North Sea, about 100 nautical miles west of Stavanger.
Rescuers found the crew on the keel of the capsized boat on Sunday afternoon. 
The Norwegian Joint Rescue Co-ordination Centre (JRCC) said three who had ingested diesel were airlifted to hospital in Bergen and one later died. 
Five others were picked up by an offshore vessel, the Olympic Challenger.
The JRCC said there was no radio contact with the stricken 24m (79ft) vessel, which was previously called Courageous when it worked out of Lerwick in Shetland.
A spokesman said they were automatically alerted by the trawler's emergency position-indicating radio beacon (EPIRB), which activated when it started taking on water. 
'Sitting on the keel'
Ståle Jamtli from the JRCC told BBC Scotland the helicopter rescue was scrambled from a nearby offshore platform.
""They were there I guess after 20-something minutes,"" he said. ""When they arrived at the wreck, they saw some people sitting on the keel of the vessel - the vessel had capsized and two people I think were in the water. 
""Five of them were picked up by a nearby vessel that came to aid. The three people that were hoisted into the helicopter, they were brought to hospital in Bergen. They all had swallowed some diesel oil. The five other guys were then picked up by another helicopter and sent ashore, but they were in fairly good shape."" 
He added: ""When you consider the circumstances, I guess they were lucky because they got a really fast recovery or help because there was an offshore helicopter that close by. 
""It probably went very fast, the capsizing, because they didn't have any rescue gear or life rescue suits on them either, so they were just in normal working clothes. They would be cold. So they were lucky that they were rescued that fast.""
A major air and sea rescue operation was launched
The Olympic Challenger's captain Sven Tore Ask received the distress message. They were five nautical miles away when they set off towards the fishing boat.
They sent out a small boat and rescued five of the crew who were in the water, before giving them warm clothes, food and drink, before the rescue helicopter arrived and transported them ashore.
Shipowner Stig Remøy said: ""The crew has done a great job, where the quick action taken has clearly saved lives.""
The UK's Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) said it received a distress alert from the EPIRB at 13:49 on Sunday in the Norwegian search and rescue region.
The Norwegian Coastguard was contacted and confirmed it had also received the alert and a helicopter had been sent. 
It is believed the boat, built in 1992, sailed from Peterhead on Saturday afternoon and is registered in North Shields.
No details about the dead man or the crew members have been released.
An FCDO (Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office) spokesperson said: ""We are supporting the family of a British man following his death in Norway. We are also supporting a British man who is hospitalised in Bergen. We remain in contact with the Norwegian authorities.""

92,92,Scans reveal how Covid may change the brain,"Mon, 07 Mar 2022 16:00:06 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-60591487,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-60591487?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,"Even after a mild infection, the overall size of the brain had shrunk, researchers found.","Scans reveal how Covid may change the brain
Catching Covid may cause changes to the brain, a study suggests.
Scientists found significant differences in MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scans before and after infection.
Even after a mild infection, the overall size of the brain had shrunk slightly, with less grey matter in the parts related to smell and memory.
The researchers do not know whether the changes are permanent but stressed the brain could heal.
The study, external is published in the journal Nature.
Lead author Prof Gwenaelle Douaud, from the Wellcome Centre for Integrative Neuroimaging, at the University of Oxford, said: ""We were looking at essentially mild infection, so to see that we could really see some differences in their brain and how much their brain had changed compared with those who had not been infected was quite a surprise.""
The UK Biobank project has followed the health of 500,000 people for about 15 years and has a database of scans recorded before the pandemic so provided a unique opportunity to study the long-term health impacts of the virus. 
The scientists rescanned:
401 participants 4.5 months, on average, after their infection, 96% of whom had had mild Covid 
384 participants who had not had Covid
They found:
The overall brain size in infected participants had shrunk between 0.2 and 2%
There were losses in grey matter in the olfactory areas, linked to smell, and regions linked to memory
Those who had recently recovered from Covid found it a bit harder to perform complex mental tasks
But the researchers do not know whether the changes are reversible or truly matter for health and wellbeing.
""We need to bear in mind that the brain is really plastic - by that we mean it can heal itself - so there is a really good chance that, over time, the harmful effects of infection will ease,"" Prof Douaud said.
The most significant loss of grey matter was in the olfactory areas - but it is unclear whether the virus directly attacks this region or cells simply die off through lack of use after people with Covid lose their sense of smell.
It is also unclear whether all variants of the virus cause this damage. 
The scans were performed when the original virus and alpha variant were prevalent and loss of smell and taste a primary symptom. 
But the number of people infected with the more recent Omicron variant reporting this symptom has fallen dramatically.
'Your mind is what is being exercised'
Paula Totaro lost her sense of smell when she caught Covid, in March 2020.
""When it was gone, it was like living in a bubble or a vacuum - I found it really isolating,"" she told BBC News.
But after contacting the charity AbScent, external, which supports people who have lost their ability to smell and taste, she began smell training.
""What smell training does - particularly if you do it twice a day, regularly, religiously - is it forces you to take the smell, allow it to go back into your nose and then to think about what it is that you're smelling,"" she said.
""And that connection between what's in the external world and what goes into your brain and your mind is what is being exercised.""
Ms Totaro has now recovered most of her sense of smell - although she still has trouble identifying what different smells are.
""It's a mix of joy that the sense has come back but still a little bit of anxiety that I'm not quite there yet,"" she said.
UK Biobank chief scientist Prof Naomi Allen said: ""It opens up all sorts of questions that other researchers can follow up about the effect of coronavirus infection on cognitive function, on brain fog and on other areas of the brain - and to really focus research on how best to mitigate that.""
Prof David Werring, from the University College London Institute of Neurology, said other health-related behaviour could have contributed to the changes seen. 
""The changes in cognitive function were also subtle and of unclear relevance to day-to-day function,"" he said.
""And these changes are not necessarily seen in every infected individual and may not be relevant for more recent strains.""

Corrie Mckeague went missing after a night out in September 2016
An airman who vanished following a night out developed a ""significant binge-drinking problem"" after a friend died on a railway line when he was a teenager, an inquest heard.
Corrie Mckeague, from Dunfermline, was 23 when he vanished in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, on 24 September 2016.
Police believe he died after climbing into a waste bin after a night out.
The inquest, due to last four weeks, is being held at Suffolk Coroner's Court in Ipswich.
The last confirmed sighting of Mr Mckeague was at 03:25 BST, when CCTV cameras recorded him walking into an area in central Bury St Edmunds known as the ""horseshoe"", behind Greggs and Superdrug, where industrial waste bins were stored.
A £2m police investigation was carried out into his disappearance, including a trawl of a landfill site at Milton, near Cambridge. His body has never been found.
Mr Mckeague was last seen on CCTV after leaving a nightclub
In a statement read out at the inquest, Martin Mckeague described his son as a ""happy child"". 
However, Mr Mckeague said there were ""major events"" that shaped his life including the separation of his parents when he was 10 years old and the discovery of his friend's body on a railway line when he was 15.  
""I believe Corrie developed a significant binge-drinking problem,"" Mr Mckeague said.
A landfill site at Milton, near Cambridge, was extensively searched as part of the investigation
He said the death of his son's friend ""was a terrible shock for a 15-year-old boy to suffer, and one I don't think he ever truly got over"".
Martin Mckeague continued: ""I don't believe Corrie was ever suicidal.
""This has been a heart-breaking tragedy.""
Nicola Urquhart, second from right, pictured with her two other sons Darroch, left, and Makeyan, is at the inquest in Ipswich
Mr Mckeague's mother Nicola Urquhart agreed the friend's death had a ""huge impact"" on her son. 
In a statement read to the inquest, she said Corrie, who had started to train as a hairdresser and then as a PE teacher before joining the RAF, had been prescribed antidepressants in the past.
But, she said, he was ""back to his usual happy self"" by 2015.
Ms Urquhart said her son ""regularly lost his phone or wallet on nights out"" but ""was never aggressive with or without alcohol"".
""There was nothing to suggest Corrie had any problems or concerns around the time of his disappearance,"" she said.
Ms Urquhart said added: ""Despite what's in the press, as far as I'm aware Corrie had never slept in a bin nor had he ever climbed into a bin to sleep.""
Posters were distributed in the search of Mr Mckeague when he went missing
Suffolk's senior coroner Nigel Parsley said Mr Mckeague, who had served in the RAF for three years, drank a ""significant amount of alcohol during the evening"" of 23 September.
He said Mr Mckeague was asked to leave Flex nightclub and ""was seen on a number of occasions on CCTV"".
Mr Parsley said police investigations and searches failed to locate him and there had been no contact with family and no financial transactions that could be linked to him.
He said over the coming weeks, jurors would hear evidence about Mr Mckeague's movements, his contact with any witnesses and ""hypotheses and possible scenarios relating to Corrie's disappearance"".

Women and children queue at Lviv station for a train to Poland. Hundred of thousands are passing through the station every day
When Svitlana Maksymenko's train pulled into the Ukrainian capital Kyiv, about halfway through her 800-mile journey from home to safety, people pushed onto every part of the carriage, she said, grasping for their own escape route west. Some abandoned their luggage. Some begged to get on. 
""They were on their knees on the platform,"" Maksymenko said. ""There was no room. There were people standing in every space, in every gangway, there were five people on every bed.""
Maksymenko's journey began in Kharkiv, an eastern city that has been heavily shelled by Russian forces, and stopped, for now, in Lviv, a picturesque western city about 50 miles from the Polish border with a grand central station that has become a waypoint for hundreds of thousands of refugees.
In almost every corner of the station concourse over the weekend, in the waiting rooms, the underpasses and all along the platforms, there were people taking shelter, sleeping, anxiously waiting, rushing for trains. There were tense moments as volunteer stewards tried to hold back the crowds of people massed at entry gates, fearful of missing their chance to escape. Women with children wept with the stress, clutching their passports and family birth certificates in one hand and their children in the other. Outside the station, there were tearful goodbyes as fighting-age men, banned from leaving Ukraine, stopped and let their families go, unsure if they would ever see them again.   
There were tense moments as stewards attempted to hold back crowds anxious to make the trains
By the time she reached Lviv, Maksymenko had been on the train with her parents-in-law and three-year-old daughter for 26 hours. Some reported longer journeys. Maksymenko was a drop in a river of people that began flowing into Lviv when Russia invaded and swelled over the past few days as Russian forces escalated their campaign of bombing against Ukrainian civilians. 
""We estimate 30,000 people arrived on Thursday, 100,000 people on Friday and at least a 100,000 more on Saturday,"" said Viktoria Khrystenko, a Lviv city council official helping to manage the influx of refugees.
""We are doing our best to cope but we have never seen anything like this,"" she said. ""We are expecting more people. It might be millions. It's a disaster. These people have nothing, just one bag because they had only three minutes to run and save their lives.""
Lviv station was heaving with people on Friday night, thinning only slightly as trains departed for Poland before filling again with new arrivals from the bombed-out cities in the north, east, and south of Ukraine. 
Outside, Kolya, 46, was standing with tears streaming down his face, watching his wife and two teenage daughters walk away from him.
""I hope they will make it safely to Europe, I want so badly to be with them,"" he said. ""This is as far as I can go.""
Ukraine has banned men aged 16-60 from leaving the country, unless they have a disability or three children under 18. They are stopped in document checks at the station or at border crossing points further west. Kolya had stood for 10 hours on the train from Kyiv to ensure his family reached Lviv safely, he said, and now he would make the same journey back to join his 19-year-old son and his brothers in the fight against Russia.  
""I will go back to Kyiv and defend my city. It is my home,"" he said. ""How, I don't know - I have asked them for a gun, but how will I protect my city from missiles with a gun?""
Poland's government began sending buses over the weekend to bring Ukraine's refugees over the border to safety.
Kolya's wife and children would press on to Poland, whose government has sent trains and buses to bring people from Ukraine into its country, sparing tens of thousands of refugees traumatic journeys to the border and long waits to cross by foot. 
By Sunday, more than 1.5 million Ukrainians had crossed into Poland, according to the UN. Hundreds of thousands more were on the move inside Ukraine.
Amid the chaos in the station at Lviv, volunteers and fellow travellers helped the very young and the very old, carrying pushchairs and suitcases up and down the stairs to the platforms, marshalling children to rooms upstairs where they could get a hot meal, and helping the elderly wherever they could.
""Physically it was very hard for me of course, people were pushing very hard,"" said Dusia Kostiuk, 91, who boarded a train in Kharkiv at 9pm on Friday, arrived in Lviv at midnight on Saturday, and spent the next 15 hours in a queue at the station to move on Poland.
""Our house was still there when we left but shelling was happening all around and we were told that terrible shelling is happening there now,"" Kostiuk said. 
""We didn't take anything with us, I took two dresses and that's it. 
""I was born and raised in Kharkiv. I didn't really travel before, I don't like to travel. I never thought I would leave my home like this."" 
Dusia Kostiuk, 91, spent 27 hours on a train from the heavily bombed city of Kharkiv to Lviv.
Many of those arriving in Lviv, like Kostiuk, stay in the station until they can board a train to Poland - some bedding down for a night or longer in any free corner. The air inside the grand waiting rooms and gangways was thick with the heat and odour of a mass of people who have been on the move for many days. 
Those who cannot move straight on to Poland head out into the city looking for temporary shelter. At a small theatre in Lviv's historic old town, 20 beds had been arranged for those who needed to spend up to three nights in the city before they can leave. 
Olha Adamenko, 32, arrived there on Sunday evening with her husband and sick two-year-old daughter. They had driven over four days from Kyiv, stopping in shelters along the way. But the shelter in the theatre was already at capacity and it was not clear whether there was going to be a bed there for her that night, the staff said. 
It was a problem many would face that night, according to Khyrstenko, the city official, who said all of the roughly 20,000 temporary beds in the city were already taken. 
At the theatre, Adam Yemchenko, a volunteer, was preparing to turn people away. ""Most people arrive later than this but people getting to us tonight won't get a bed, we will have to send them somewhere else,"" he said. 
""Some will carry straight on to the border but they face an eight hour wait there in the cold.""
Refugees rest in a shelter in a small theatre in Lviv. By early evening on Sunday the shelter was full and turning people away.
This was the choice facing Adamenko, as she sat down inside the small theatre foyer looking tired and stressed. She stopped to breastfeed her daughter, who was restless and tearful. Her husband would soon have to leave them here in Lviv and travel back to Kyiv to join the territorial defence forces. 
She asked the volunteers at the shelter how to reach the Polish border by bus and which were the best border crossings. 
""Maybe we will go tonight,"" she said. But she was worried, there were long queues at the crossing points and it was the depth of winter. 
""I heard people are queuing outside there during the day but at night locals take them into their homes, but I don't know if it is true,"" she said. ""I am worried about the baby, she is sick and tired.""
Adamenko was also starting to worry more about her husband. She thought their local defence battalion on the outskirts of Kyiv would be relatively safe, but heavy fighting surrounded it over the weekend in the districts of Bucha and Irpin. 
""Maybe that means the Russians will go through our neighbourhood next,"" she said.
A young boy leaves Ukraine on a bus bound for Poland. Thousands of children have spent hours away from home.
As night fell, Adamenko and her husband left the theatre and walked into Lviv with directions to another shelter, where if she could find a bed they would part - one on to safety abroad, one back to danger at home.
Later on Sunday night, at the station, many thousands more people were still arriving and departing. They formed queues that were as orderly as possible under the circumstances and continued to help each other. Volunteers bustled through the crowds with trays made from cardboard boxes, handing out tea and snacks in plastic cups.
At the same time, Viktoria Khrystenko, the city council official, was driving her own three children to the Polish border. They had left on Sunday morning and by early Monday morning they had been in the car nearly 24 hours through the bitterly cold night.
Eventually they crossed in to Poland and Khrystenko left her children with relatives and began the long return journey to Lviv. As she drove, she wept. 
""I'm sorry, I'm emotional because I didn't sleep at all,"" she said. ""I had a task to take my kids to a safe place across the border and I have done that, so now I need to go back to Lviv and continue to help.""
Khrystenko was born here in Lviv. She had never been more proud of its people, she said. They were ""ready to give away their last package of buckwheat or can of food"" to help others. ""We have only one Ukraine and we need to save it,"" she said.
She hung up and drove on, headed for her three-room apartment in the city, where there were 17 women and children from all over Ukraine resting after long journeys to Lviv. She had taken home as many people from the station as she could, she said.
Outside Lviv station fire barrels were lit during the night to keep the crowds warm

Fighting has raged in Ukraine since Russia launched a full-scale invasion in February 2022. Russian forces have made small gains in recent months but now Ukrainian forces have staged a counter-offensive into Russia.
Here is a recap of recent significant events and the situation in Ukraine. 
Ukraine sends units into Russia
Ukrainian troops launched a surprise attack across the border in early August, advancing up to 18 miles (30km) into the Russian region of Kursk.
Almost 200,000 people were evacuated from areas along the border by the Russian government and President Vladimir Putin condemned the Ukrainian offensive as a ""major provocation"".
After two weeks, Ukraine's top commander claimed to control more than 1,200 sq km of Russian territory and 93 villages. The regions of Kursk and Belgorod have both declared a state of emergency.
The counter-offensive is seen partly as an attempt to force Russia to redeploy units from the east and relieve pressure on the beleaguered Ukrainian defences there, and partly as a bid to improve Ukraine's chances of a peace settlement.
Russian incursion north of Kharkiv
At the beginning of May 2024, Russian forces crossed the international border to the north of Ukraine's second-biggest city, Kharkiv. Several villages were seized and thousands of civilians fled.
Russia's main offensive has long focused on the eastern Donetsk region, but this was one of the most significant ground assaults since the start of the war and further stretched Ukraine's front-line defences.
The Russian push took place at the end of a four-month period when the US was not supplying weapons to Ukraine, due to a stalemate in the US Congress.  
The issue was finally resolved at the end of April, when the US passed a $61bn aid package to provide missiles, artillery and air-defence systems to the Ukrainian military.
Ukrainian forces eventually held firm and even though the city of Kharkiv has come under repeated attack from glide bombs fired by Russian warplanes, it remains beyond the range of Russian artillery.
Russia grinds forward in the east
The incursion north of Kharkiv was some distance from the main front line in the east where Russia has continued its offensive operations and been edging forwards since October 2023.
Eastern Ukraine has been contested territory since 2014, when Russian-backed fighters seized large swathes of the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions. 
Russia's biggest advantage is manpower and it has shown a willingness to throw soldiers at Ukrainian positions to gain a few metres at a time. 
About 1,200 Russian soldiers were being killed or wounded every day in May and June, the highest rate since the beginning of the war, according to Western officials.
In recent days, Russian troops have made some significant gains to the north-west of Donetsk and claim to have captured the small town of Niu-York.
In response, Ukraine has ordered the evacuation of the city of Pokrovsk, with a local military official telling residents that Russian forces were ""rapidly approaching"". 
The Russian advance towards Pokrovsk is the most notable change in control of the front line near Donetsk for several months. 
The last major change came when Ukraine withdrew its troops from Avdiivka, just north of Donetsk, back in February after months of fighting. 
Almost all of Avdiivka's pre-war population of more than 30,000 people have left and the town itself is almost completely destroyed.
To the north, areas around Bakhmut have remained a flashpoint and have endured some of the heaviest fighting of the war. 
Although Ukraine gained some ground around Chasiv Yar, which is situated on high ground some 10km west of Bakhmut, Russian forces have since made further advances in the area. 
Two and a half years of fighting
Russia's invasion began with dozens of missile strikes on cities all over Ukraine before dawn on 24 February 2022.
Russian ground troops moved in quickly and within a few weeks were in control of large areas of Ukraine and had advanced to the suburbs of Kyiv.
Russian forces were bombarding Kharkiv, and they had taken territory in the east and south as far as Kherson, and surrounded the port city of Mariupol.
But they hit very strong Ukrainian resistance almost everywhere and faced serious logistical problems with poorly motivated Russian troops suffering shortages of food, water and ammunition.
Ukrainian forces were also quick to deploy Western supplied arms such as the Nlaw anti-tank system, which proved highly effective against the Russian advance.
By October 2022, the picture had changed dramatically and having failed to take Kyiv, Russia withdrew completely from the north. The following month, Ukrainian forces recaptured the southern city of Kherson.
Since then, the battle has mostly been in the east of Ukraine with Russian forces slowly gaining ground over many months, while losing at least 50,000 troops - and probably many more.

96,96,How many refugees have fled Ukraine and where are they going?,"Mon, 07 Mar 2022 15:04:02 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-60555472,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-60555472?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,The UN says four million people may try to escape the war in Ukraine.,"How many Ukrainian refugees are there and where have they gone?
At least 12 million people have fled their homes since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the United Nations (UN) says. 
More than five million have left for neighbouring countries, while seven million people are still thought to be displaced inside Ukraine itself. 
However, hundreds of thousands of refugees have returned to their home country - especially to cities like Kyiv.
Where are refugees going?
The UN says that, as of 4 July, external, more than 5.2 million refugees from Ukraine have been recorded across Europe. More than 3.5 million have applied for temporary residence in another country: 
Russia: (estimated) 1,412,425 Ukrainian refugees recorded
Poland: 1,194,642 
Moldova: 82,700
Romania: 83,321
Slovakia: 79,770
Hungary: 25,800
Belarus: 9,820 
Others have moved on to other countries, especially those who crossed into Poland, Hungary and Slovakia. These nations have open borders with other EU states, external. 
The UN says there are more than 867,000 Ukrainians in Germany, almost 382,768 in the Czech Republic and 141,562 in Italy. 
Some Ukrainians travelled to Russia from the regions of Luhansk and Donetsk, which are now mostly in the hands of pro-Russian separatist forces. 
President Vladimir Putin said his forces evacuated 140,000 civilians from Mariupol, external and insisted none of them was forced to go to Russia. However, volunteer groups, external say they have helped thousands of Ukrainians leave Russia.
What help are countries offering refugees?
The EU has granted Ukrainians the automatic right to stay and work throughout its 27 member nations for up to three years. 
Refugees are housed in reception centres if they can't stay with friends or relatives. They are given food and medical care, and information about onward travel.
They are entitled to social welfare payments and access to housing, medical treatment and schools.
Poland, one of the countries which has taken the highest number of refugees, and Moldova, which has the largest concentration of refugees by population, have asked for additional support. 
Hundreds of refugees were housed in this athletics centre in Moldova
How many people are returning to Ukraine?
The UN says that as of 21 June, there have been over 3 million ""cross-border movements"" back into Ukraine, external, but says this number does not refer to individual refugees.
Ukraine's border force had previously said people were crossing back into the country at a rate of about 30,000 a day.
Some are returning to areas of Ukraine such as the capital Kyiv, which were threatened by Russian army advances at the start of the war, but which are now considered safer. 
In May, Kyiv mayor Vitali Klitschko said the city's population was back to two-thirds of its pre-war level, external. 
Where are people fleeing inside Ukraine?
The UN's International Organisation for Migration (IOM) said in May that more than seven million people remain internally displaced, external:
27% of refugees were from the Kharkiv region
16% from Kyiv 
16% from the Donetsk region in eastern Ukraine
24% indicated their homes had been damaged or attacked in the war
The IOM estimates that more than half of the people who are internally displaced are women. Many are particularly vulnerable because they are pregnant or have small children, have a disability or are a victim of violence.
The UN is working alongside other organisations to provide cash, food and other supplies. 
The UN estimates that about eight million people are displaced inside Ukraine
What is the UK doing to help Ukrainian refugees?
The UK introduced a family visa scheme, external for Ukrainians who have an immediate or extended family member in the UK.
After the government response was criticised, it launched the Homes for Ukraine scheme to allow those without relatives in the UK to settle. 
People in the UK can nominate an individual or family to stay with them rent-free for at least six months.
Refugees who come via the scheme can live and work in the UK for up to three years, and get access to healthcare, welfare and schools.
Applications are made online, external, and both hosts and refugees are vetted. Hosts receive £350 a month.
Many families who have applied to be sponsors have complained that the system is too slow and complicated.
As of 28 June, the government had issued 142,500 Ukrainian visas, external out of 161,500 applications received, and as of 27 June, 86,600 visa holders had arrived in the UK.

97,97,Five ways the Ukraine war could push up prices,"Mon, 07 Mar 2022 12:22:42 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-60509453,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-60509453?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,Prices for everyday items could go up at a time when the cost of living is already rising.,"Five ways the Ukraine war could push up prices
Severe sanctions on Russia aim to isolate the country and create a deep recession there, but the economic fallout will also be felt by people around the world.
The sharp rise in the prices of things from oil and metals to wheat is expected to push up the cost of many everyday items from food to petrol and heating.
1. It might cost (even) more to heat your home
Russia is the world's largest natural gas exporter, which is vital for heating homes
People in the UK and Europe are already paying high prices for energy and fuel.
The Russia-Ukraine conflict has so far driven these even higher and caused the price of oil to jump to level in almost 14 years, while wholesale gas prices have more than doubled. 
If gas prices stay at that level, energy analysts have warned that household fuel bills in the UK could reach as much as £3,000 a year, while average UK petrol prices have repeatedly hit record highs, with the latest price at 155p and diesel at 161p. 
Russia is the second-biggest exporter of crude oil, and the world's largest natural gas exporter, which is vital to heating homes, powering planes and filling cars with fuel.
The UK gets only 6% of its crude oil and 5% of its gas from Russia, but the EU sources nearly half of its gas from the country.
If one country reliant on Russian supplies receives less gas, they have to replace it, impacting the supplies of gas for other countries - that's why British energy prices and bills are still affected in a similar way to European ones.
There are fears President Vladimir Putin might ""weaponise"" Russia's natural resources by reducing supplies of gas to Europe in response to sanctions. Politicians in Germany are calling for a ""national gas reserve"" to be created to protect consumers from price shocks.
Meanwhile, the US is discussing a potential ban on buying Russian energy which has also fuelled price rises.
Plane fuel is also linked to the price of crude oil and Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary has warned tickets for this summer will be higher than 2019, partly because of the rise in the price of oil.
2. Your food shop could cost more
Tinned goods could rise further if aluminium prices remain high
UK food producers don't import many items from Russia or Ukraine, but prices here may still rise because of an increase in associated costs, such as tinned cans and packaging and transport.
Meanwhile, the cost of everyday food items might rise in places like Turkey and North Africa, which rely on wheat and corn from Ukraine and Russia.
Both countries, once dubbed ""the breadbasket of Europe"", export about a quarter of the world's wheat and half of its sunflower products, like seeds and oil. Ukraine also sells a lot of corn globally.
Analysts have warned that war could impact the production of grains and even double global wheat prices.
More than 40% of Ukraine's wheat and corn exports went to the Middle East or Africa last year - and disruptions to supply could affect availability in these areas.
The UK, by contrast, typically produces more than 90% of the wheat consumed in the country. But farmers here might find themselves paying more for fertiliser, which is one of Russia's biggest exports.
3. Your mortgage repayments may rise
Homeowners in the UK would see mortgage repayments rise if the Bank of England's base rate went up
Inflation, which measures how fast the cost of living rises over time, hit 7.5% in January in the US - the highest level seen there since February 1982 - and rose by 5.5% in the UK. 
But one economist has warned it could rise close to 10% in major Western economies if the cost of energy and food is pushed up by dwindling supplies cause by the Russian-Ukraine conflict.
Such a figure might encourage the Bank of England and the US Federal Reserve to increase interest rates. The idea is that when borrowing is more expensive, people will have less money to spend. As a result, they will buy fewer things, and prices will stop rising as fast.
But in the UK, for example, about 2.2 million homeowners with mortgages linked to the Bank of England's base rate would see repayments go up, putting further pressure on household budgets that are already being squeezed by the cost of living.
4. Your pension might fluctuate - but don't panic
Widespread falls in share prices, such as those triggered on Thursday, are likely to be bad news for pension savers
Russian stocks crashed by as much as 45% in the wake of the Ukraine invasion with trading subsequently suspended, with banks and oil companies among the worst affected. 
It also led to steep falls on stock markets elsewhere around the world: in Europe the UK's FTSE 100 index has fallen over 6% since Russia crossed into Ukraine while Germany's Dax index is nearly 10% lower.
Many people's reaction to stock market changes is that they are not directly affected, because they don't invest money in stocks and shares. But there are millions of people with a pension whose savings are invested in the stock market.
If widespread falls in share prices are sustained then it's likely to be bad news for pension savers because the value of their savings pot is influenced by the performance of investments.
Some investors or savers might look to protect their money or assets by moving them to traditional ""safe havens"", like gold, especially as the markets are likely to see more volatility as the crisis develops.
But pension savings, like any investments, are usually a long-term bet and advisers say it's important not to panic about short-term movements up or down.
5. DIY and cars could cost more
Canned goods may become more expensive if metal price rises persist, the LME chief executive said
As a leading commodities exporter, Russia is one of the world's largest suppliers of metals used in everything from aluminium cans, to copper wires, to car components, such as nickel, which is used in lithium-iron batteries, and palladium, which is used in catalytic converters.
Everyday goods - which may seem far removed from the conflict - may rise as a result of it.
""When you buy your drinks can made of aluminium, or when you make renovations to your house and you need copper for your wiring, all of those prices do go into the overall inflationary pressure,"" the boss of the London Metals Exchange has warned.
If Vladimir Putin decided to cut off supplies of these metals in retaliation to sanctions, existing supply problems could worsen, with car firms having to find alternative sources.
Russia is also home to manufacturing hubs for brands like Stellantis, Volkswagen and Toyota. Some production has already been paused at Russian car plants, while shipping and delivery companies halting activity to and from the country is likely to impact the availability of new cars.

Racheal Diyaolu has been taking cover in her university's bunker since the Russian invasion
An Irish medical student is attempting to leave Ukraine after sheltering for days from airstrikes and shelling in the eastern town of Sumy.
Racheal Diyaolu, who is 19 and from Carlow, was among hundreds of international students in the city close to Ukraine's border with Russia.
Sumy has been under attack by Russia since its invasion started last month.
Racheal told BBC News NI she had been mentally ""blocking out"" the dangers she faced.
It is understood she left Sumy on Monday after she was picked up by two Scottish men attempting a rescue who her family had been in contact with.
Her sister, Christiana, said she had passed safely through a number of checkpoints and was staying overnight at a ""safe stopover location"" before a curfew begins.
""The relief just knowing that they're safe and sheltered,"" she told BBC Radio Ulster's Evening Extra programme.
""We're hoping for the best now.""
A previous rescue effort failed on Sunday when a minivan used by the men was targeted by ""warning shots"" from Russian forces as they tried to enter Sumy, Racheal said.
However, they managed to reach an agreed pick-up location on Monday morning.
Change of plans
On Monday night, Racheal said that the group planned to head for Moldova on Tuesday.
""Hopefully we'll be able to get to the border and find our way through, and get home soon,"" she said in a video, posted on Twitter.

Earlier, she had told RTÉ's Morning Ireland programme they hoped to travel in the direction of Poland, a journey which could take up to 20 hours.
She was not sure if they could make use of humanitarian corridors. 
""I have left behind lots of friends who are still stuck there and still looking for ways to get out, and most of my belongings as well,"" she explained.
""I'm fine, just trying to stay in high spirits and keep positive that we'll make it to Poland.""
Christiana said the Scottish men had their phones seized during the attack on Sunday before being told to turn back.
""Luckily they were able to find an alternative route into Sumy and stayed there overnight and then continued their mission this morning,"" she added.
Racheal has been studying in Ukraine since November
The Irish Department of Foreign Affairs told BBC News NI it was aware of 52 Irish citizens remaining in Ukraine.
On Sunday, UN monitors said 364 civilian deaths had been confirmed in Ukraine since the invasion began on 24 February, but the real figure was likely to be ""considerably higher"".
Ms Diyaolu arrived in the country from the Republic of Ireland for her studies last November.
Since the invasion started, she has been taking cover in her university's bunker when air raid sirens have sounded.
""Someone will come and knock on your door on all the floors to let them know that it's time to go down and take cover, bring your essentials and your documents,"" she told BBC News NI before her latest attempt to leave Sumy.
The Ukrainian deputy prime minister has said Russia is striking civilian targets in Ukraine, including hospitals, nurseries, and schools.

IN DEPTH: Full coverage of the conflict
At the beginning of the invasion, Russian tanks and troops poured into Ukraine at points along its borders including northern regions such as Sumy. 
Ms Diyaolu said it had been ""an out-of-body experience"" to know there is such danger outside.
""I've had to train my mind to block out the fact that this is incoming danger,"" she told BBC News NI.
""It does happen so frequently at this point that you kind of don't have time to be afraid any more.""
Russian forces have been heavily shelling towns outside the capital of Kyiv
The student said things had become quite difficult in Sumy, ""especially for people who are trying to get out"".
""It's been quite hard going, we've had a lot of air strike threats, we've had quite a few bombs being dropped,"" she said.
'I haven't lost hope'
The medical student said she had tried to ""hold on to hope"" that she would be able to get home.
""It's especially hard on my mother, she's just worried to death all day every day, trying to get in contact with me,"" she said.
""The best thing I can do is stay calm when I am talking to her, letting her know that I'm OK.
""I know that I'm in a scary situation and in a dangerous area, but letting her know that I'm OK, mentally and physically, and that my mind is with them at home and my mind is focused on staying safe and trying to find ways to get out.""
Ms Diyaolu's family have been calling for more help from the Irish government to bring the 19-year-old home.
Ireland's Department of Foreign Affairs said it could not comment on specific cases, but confirmed it was in contact with Irish citizens in Ukraine.
It has advised people to ""shelter in a secure place"" or, if it is safe to do so, to ""consider leaving Ukraine, depending on their location and prevailing circumstances"".

99,99,Economic Crime Bill: What is it and will it find Putin's loot?,"Thu, 03 Mar 2022 17:17:00 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-60579997,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-60579997?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,"Will the Economic Crime Bill really tackle Putin's money - or is it too little, too late?","Economic Crime Act: What is it and will it find Putin's loot?
MPs have backed legislation to stop Vladimir Putin's allies from laundering money and hiding wealth in the UK. 
The Economic Crime Act became law in March after being rushed through Parliament. 
What is the UK's problem with Russian money?
The UK is thought to be awash with Russian cash and other money looted from the former Soviet Union. 
That cash is buried in vast amounts of property - from office blocks to mega mansions - and the true owners are hidden in a web of secretive shell companies. These are organisations that only exist on paper and are registered in offshore tax havens. 
The Economic Crime Act is meant to help end that -  having been promised since 2016. It was shelved earlier in 202,  amid much criticism - including from the fraud minister, Lord Agnew, who quit. Now, the invasion of Ukraine has prompted a government U-turn. Only part of the original plan has made it into law because there's not enough Parliamentary time to deal with all proposals.
The legislation: 
creates a register of overseas ownership of UK land and property - with punishments for withholding details
overhauls Unexplained Wealth Orders 
makes it easier to prosecute anyone involved in sanctions-busting
Why will the foreign ownership register matter? 
If an individual owns a property, investigators and the public can find out who they are. 
The police will often seize property belonging to British drug bosses because it's easy to identify, and will have been bought with their criminal wealth.
But discovering who owns property becomes more difficult if it is registered to an overseas company whose ultimate beneficiaries are hidden from view. 
And that means it's harder to uncover money stolen from abroad as it's laundered through the British property market. 
How does this hamper investigations?
Let's take the case of the first successful Unexplained Wealth Order (UWO). That's a legal tool that allows the National Crime Agency (NCA) to go to court to seize a property if there's no apparent legitimate source of the wealth behind the purchase.
Zamira Hajiyeva: Denied wrongdoing
UWOs are designed to take on incredibly rich people believed to have been associated with international corruption, organised criminals and their helpers.
The first target was Zamira Hajiyeva, the wife of an Azerbaijan banker. Her husband was jailed for embezzling millions from the state - Mrs Hajiyeva herself denies wrongdoing.
Woman who spent £16m in Harrods revealed
How to spend £16m in Harrods
She was living in a £15m home near Harrods, where she spent millions over a decade. 
The Land Registry showed the owner wasn't her, but a mystery company in the British Virgin Islands (BVI), a tax haven. 
The Land Registry record showing who owned the home Zamira Hajiyeva lived in (some information redacted by the BBC for privacy law reasons)
It was only with the help of BVI investigators that the NCA could legally link Mrs Hajiyeva to the home and force her to explain in court how she could afford it.
So how will the new register work? 
When a lawyer typically registers ownership of land and property, they will have to declare in public records who ultimately benefits from it. That means corrupt politicians hiding wealth in British mansions, office blocks and luxury apartments, may at long last, become visible.  
The registry will apply to any property bought in the last 20 years, or since 2014 in Scotland. 
If the person registering the property fails to identify the beneficiary, the property will be, in effect, frozen - the owner won't be able lease it, sell it or raise a mortgage. 
Dirty money campaigners are delighted, but still have concerns. One fear is that it may be too difficult to prosecute lawyers or company agents who fail to reveal beneficiaries - because a court would have to be sure they had acted knowingly or recklessly. 
Another concern is that the package has too many loopholes to ensure that ultimate beneficial owners become known. For instance, if someone uses a front company, registered in Panama, to legally own property on their behalf - and there's no shareholder who owns more than a quarter of that company, then the register won't reveal their identity. 
""For the sufficiently determined owner of a UK property who wants to remain anonymous, we think the Act leaves loopholes,"" says George Crozier, spokesman for the Chartered Institute of Taxation.  
Dr Susan Hawley of Spotlight on Corruption, an expert campaign group on dirty money, warns the law won't ""unpack the Russian doll'.
Others predict that suspects - such as people who may be holding property for President Putin - could spirit wealth out of the country before the law is in force. The government abandoned its original proposal to give overseas entities 18 months to comply with the disclosure rules, by changing the deadline to six months. Labour had proposed 28 days - but that was defeated. 
""I imagine that a lot of people in Kensington [one of London's most expensive areas] will be sticking property on Rightmove,"" says Helena Wood, a financial crime expert at the Rusi think tank. 
""Practically speaking, these measures were never going to deal with [current] dodgy Russian assets. But they will mean it will be less likely that someone will want to hide money in the UK.""
What about the Unexplained Wealth Order (UWO) proposals?  
UWOs, created in 2017, are trumpeted by ministers as an incredibly powerful weapon - but they have in fact only been used against four targets. 
High Court: NCA has to allocate huge legal resources to fighting money laundering cases
That's because the NCA lost one of its test cases in 2020, which not only exposed flaws in the power, but left the taxpayer with a near £1m legal bill.
When the Intelligence and Security Committee investigated Russia's role in the UK, external, Lynne Owens, the then head of the NCA, bluntly admitted that using UWOs to pursue the richest and most powerful targets carried huge financial risks. 
And so critics of the government say the agency hasn't the financial clout or legal powers to make UWOs workable.
The Economic Crime Bill would permit investigators to target people who manage properties within complicated offshore arrangements, even if they're not the actual beneficiary. That will immediately widen the number of available targets. They'll also be given far more legal time to draw up a copper-bottomed case for court. 
But most importantly, the NCA will be protected against crippling legal costs, providing they acted reasonable and properly.
Helena Wood at Rusi says the government could do more to financially protect the NCA across all its asset recovery powers - and failing to do so defeats the whole point of Parliament creating laws to investigate super-rich suspects.
Dr Susan Hawley says the government must seize the opportunity. 
""The NCA needs one big properly-funded anti-corruption unit - from looking at professional ""enablers"", like accountants and lawyers, through to people involved in busting sanctions,"" she says. 
""Without a significant boost in resources none of these measures are going to work.""

Tomas Francis (L) reels after colliding with Owen Watkin (R) while they attempt to tackle Charlie Ewels
Guinness Six Nations: Wales v France
Venue: Principality Stadium, Cardiff Date: Friday, 11 March Kick-off: 20:00 GMT
Coverage: Watch live on BBC One, BBC iPlayer and online from 19:30 GMT; listen on BBC Radio 5 Live, BBC Radio Wales and BBC Radio Cymru; text commentary on BBC Sport website and app.
The decision to declare Wales prop Tomas Francis fit to face France in the Six Nations in Cardiff on Friday has been described as a ""grave mistake"".
Francis, Owen Watkin and Josh Adams have passed concussion protocols after suffering head blows in Wales' defeat by England on 26 February.
Professor John Fairclough says selection would put Francis at ""unnecessary risk of serious harm"".
Wales defence coach Gethin Jenkins expected the trio to train on Monday.
""All three have gone through their concussion protocols and return to play, and all three are expected to be training today and be fit for Friday's game,"" said Jenkins.
""We always worry when they have to go through protocols. It's quite a stringent process. 
""We've lost people in the past due to that, and it's unfortunate. It is a good boost that we have all got three available.""
'Francis should not play against France'
Cardiff wing Adams was the victim of a late high tackle from England replacement Joe Marchant which went unpunished, but the incident involving Watkin and Francis caused greater controversy.
The pair sustained head injuries in the 20th minute at Twickenham when they collided while trying to tackle England lock Charlie Ewels.
Both left the field for head injuries assessments (HIA) and passed the tests to return.
Owen Watkin suffered a cut head during the clash of heads with Tomas Francis
The handling of the incident was criticised as a ""clear and flagrant breach"" of head injury assessment protocol by Progressive Rugby, a lobby group on player protection.
The claims were made in an open letter by Professor Bill Ribbans and Professor Fairclough, who used to work with the Welsh Rugby Union. 
Francis struggled back to his feet and leant on the post after the incident before being seen by the Welsh medics.
The letter claimed that ""there were 12 Criteria 1 signs and symptoms with six possibly observed on video and the remaining five identified during the on-field assessment"".
The two doctors claim ""the typical observation on video are confirmed loss of consciousness, suspected loss of consciousness, convulsion, tonic posturing, balance disturbance/ataxia and clearly dazed"".
In a separate article, external, Prof Fairclough has again urged Wales not to pick Francis against France.
""Like any Welsh fan I want to see Tomas Francis in the Welsh team, because he's a terrific player and would be key against a very good French side,"" said Prof Fairclough.
""But I have carefully reviewed the footage numerous times, and in my expert view, it is beyond any doubt Tomas had suffered a brain injury.
""As someone who has taken an oath to protect life, I can't, in all good conscience, fail to highlight I think him playing the next game puts him at unnecessary risk of serious harm, whether that be now or in the future.
""The HIA protocols undertaken during the England game were shown to be not fit for purpose. 
""They were unable to recognise the fact he had clearly sustained criteria 1 signs of on-field concussion. 
""The serious features displayed by Francis should outweigh the results of any subsequent assessment indicating he is sufficiently recovered in time to return for the French game. 
""Wales may claim that he has been 'passed fit'. For me that would be a grave mistake.""

'The nitty gritty wins you games, not attack' says Wales defence coach Jenkins
Jenkins says that incident at Twickenham was being still investigated by the Six Nations.
""I don't think the review has been finished yet,"" said Jenkins.
""We will wait to see what comes of that. I personally didn't see it live. I was more concerned about the poor defence that happened. I saw it after. 
""The people in charge and the medical people will have gone through all that, and I am sure the review will see what comes of it.""
When asked whether Francis should have played on at Twickenham or play against France with the review ongoing, Jenkins replied: ""The HIA process has been in place for a long time now, and players and staff, we all abide by it. 
""We've got to back what has happened there, and if anything else comes out of it, it comes out of it. 
""The player has passed all the protocols, done his graduated return to play, ticked off all his contact boxes, and he is available for selection.""
Navidi back in business
Jenkins welcomed the return of Cardiff flanker Josh Navidi who has been called into the squad after recovering from a long-term shoulder injury.
Navidi, 31, played 80 minutes in his first game in almost five months on Friday in Cardiff's United Rugby Championship away defeat against Ulster on Friday.
""It's pleasing for us to see him come through the game for Cardiff and he's done it before, coming back on the back of not many games,"" added Jenkins.
""He's a bit ring rusty, but we have confidence his physicality will come back pretty quickly. He'll be looking forward to seeing what selection is.""

Sir Vivian Richards is in reflective mood. 
""As the days go by you may not look your age but certainly you do feel it,"" he says.
He is 70, but certainly doesn't look it. The death of legendary Australia leg-spinner Shane Warne, a man he describes as 'joyous', has moved him deeply.
But Richards has other reasons to reflect.  
The impact of his batting went far beyond the runs he scored - 15,261, including 35 centuries, across 308 Tests and one-day internationals for West Indies. That's only a statistical estimation of greatness.
Richards knows the way he played cricket, his poise and courage, was hugely influential, especially for black people.
""As a young man growing up, I was always reading about the struggles in America, the Black Panthers,"" he says.
""I was conscious in that way, it was a message being sent. These were defenders of your race because of some of the stuff which was going on.
""I was pretty strong about that. Maybe that's why some folks would look at me sometimes and say, 'Wow, what an arrogant guy' in the way he walked out and stuff like that.
""It isn't arrogance. I just believe in human beings and that's the most important thing.""
We meet in the north of Antigua, not far from where Richards grew up and only 15 minutes from the stadium which carries his name.
England in West Indies 2022
During the three-Test series between West Indies and England, that starts at the Sir Vivian Richards Cricket Stadium on Tuesday, the two sides will play for the new Richards-Botham Trophy.
His friendship with former England all-rounder and captain Lord Botham began in 1974 when they were team-mates at Somerset. 
""He's a guy who I've spent a great amount of time with in my life, sharing dressing rooms and being in opposition also,"" says Richards of Lord Botham.
""Having the trophy with someone who you hold dear to your heart and you consider a friend - that is pretty good news in my opinion.""
Sir Viv Richards and Lord Botham unveiled the new trophy named after them, which replaces the Wisden Trophy, in Antigua
Later, when they meet at the stadium, Richards and Botham embrace, banter and giggle together as if they were back in the flat they shared as young cricketers in Taunton.
Both men produced heroic displays for their countries over the years although, as Botham readily admits, West Indies utterly dominated England during his Test career.
Test cricket back then was, without doubt, the format that mattered. Yet some of Richards' Test innings, like the 110 from 58 balls in Antigua in 1986, which featured one-handed sixes, practically invented T20 batting. 
He smiles and explains: ""Sometimes you become a little bit bored with just the general stuff and you try to be creative.
""This is what my game was always about, being as creative as possible, giving the best I can, believing in the talent you have.
""That is of paramount importance, for any young individual. If you have it, flaunt it.""
There's an easy laughter which follows this answer as Richards fondly enjoys the memories.
But his understanding and passion for history is far deeper. Antigua was a British colony which used African slave labour on its plantations.
When we discuss the legacy of the British Empire it is not enough to simply stop at cricket.
""We, as a people, have given this world a lot,"" adds Richards.
""And the generations who come through whatever period of colonialism, and who were responsible for that, should tell their generations and kids. Let them know exactly how some obviously gained their wealth.
""We played a huge part without being paid. So, we hear nowadays about reparations for slavery and that to me is a good call.""
At 70, Richards has a perspective far beyond cricket but then, he always did.
I wish him happy birthday and he accepts by extending his appreciation.
""Let me take this opportunity to thank all the individuals around the world who would have admired the way I've done things,"" says Richards. ""Even the haters, I do appreciate you all.
""Thank you so much, for my 70th.""

Russian gymnast Ivan Kuliak is being investigated after wearing a national war symbol on his leotard as he stood next to a Ukrainian rival on the podium in Qatar on Saturday.
The International Gymnastics Federation (FIG) said it had opened disciplinary proceedings against Kuliak for his ""shocking behaviour"" at the Apparatus World Cup in Doha.
Kuliak earned bronze in the parallel bars final and displayed a letter 'Z' taped to his chest as he stood next to gold medal winner Illia Kovtun of Ukraine.
The letter Z has become symbolic with Russia's invasion of Ukraine and has been seen painted on the side of tanks and military vehicles, as well as being worn by pro-war politicians in Russia.
This weekend was the final opportunity for Russian and Belarusian gymnasts to compete after their countries were sanctioned by the FIG as a result of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
From Monday, Russian and Belarusian athletes, officials and judges will not be allowed to take part in FIG competitions or FIG-sanctioned competitions.

Residents of Irpin are fleeing the Russian assault on their city, which is half an hour's drive from Kyiv
They came on foot, in an endless stream - trying to outpace the Russian shells laying waste to their hometown. There were families with children in strollers clutching stuffed toys, young mothers with babes in arms, and the elderly moving as fast as their years would allow. Most were silent. Some were weeping. At the edge of Irpin there was urgency, panic, and anguish. It felt like we were witnessing the death of a city. 
""Everything is bombed,"" said Valentina, as she rushed past us, fleeing her home and her life with just a single bag over her shoulder. ""There are no lights,"" she said, ""there's been no electricity, no gas, and no internet for two to three days. People are sitting in the basements and kids are sick there.""
Russian forces are already inside the city. 
""Part of Irpin was captured by Russian invaders but part of the city is fighting and not surrendering,"" said the mayor, Oleksandr Markushyn, in a video he posted on social media. 
Those trying to flee are still being targeted, as the mayor himself saw yesterday. ""The Russian invaders fired on our local civilians,"" he said. ""A family died. This shell, this mine hit, and in front of my eyes two children and two adults died.""
It seems clear that the Russian strategy is to terrorise the residents of Irpin into submission and empty the city - a tactic Moscow has used elsewhere from Grozny to Aleppo. The residents who remain have endured days and nights of relentless bombardment. We could hear the assault during an earlier visit on Saturday. The soundtrack was the same today, except maybe louder. And this time we could also hear grad rocket fire, and occasional gunshots.

Jeremy Bowen was on the frontline in Irpin, as residents came under Russian fire while trying to flee.
""Tell everyone to close the skies, urgently, we need it,"" said Andrei as he dashed past - with his pet poodle - pleading for a no-fly zone. ""Close the skies - please. It's hell, it's really hell. The Russian soldiers are bombing civilian houses. The Russians are not fighting the army. They are fighting anyone.""
He knew it was time to go when the Russians arrived on his street. ""We saw the armoured vehicles near our house. They passed by. Then the tank stopped and blew up a house near me. So, I think we are lucky, we are all really lucky that we are here.""
Andrei says Russian tanks blew up a house close to his
The 36-year-old is - or was - an events manager. 'I make the people laugh, with shows, concerts. But I think I have no work now in Ukraine,"" he said. Then he joined the crowds heading for minibuses that are screeching to and from the edge of the city, ferrying people, and pets, to the railway station in Kyiv - a lifeline for those trying to escape to western Ukraine.
Getting out of Irpin means picking your way over a mass of rubble, and jagged boulders and metal bars that now litter the bed of the Irpin river. This is the remains of a bridge blown up by Ukrainian forces to block - or at least slow - Russian armour reaching the capital. Planks of wood are balanced precariously on the wreckage. One elderly man almost tumbled from a plank into the water. Then he summoned his courage and shuffled forward. Nearby a woman lay flat on the ground on the riverbank - conscious but immobile. We were told she had fallen. No one knew how to try to move her.
Ukrainian forces blew up the bridge themselves, hoping to slow the Russian advance
As we filmed a gunshot rang out. A Ukrainian soldier took a screaming young boy by the hand and ran with him to cover. Two others grabbed a buggy. Another helped a woman on a crutch, who was breathless with exertion.  
A blackened building was still smouldering, neatly framed by the golden onion domes of the church directly behind (which appeared to be intact). This was an image of Ukraine, past and present, of war and peace. 
The golden domes of a church rise just behind a damaged building
The country's future is painful to imagine, but it's already being sketched out in cities under bombardment from Kharkiv to Mariupol, where cold, frightened civilians cower in basements, or try to run for their lives.
And what we witnessed in Irpin could be a chronicle of the capital foretold. Kyiv lies straight down the road, about half an hour's drive away - a distance of 26km or 16 miles. That's why Irpin matters so much to both sides.
There's no doubting the fighting spirit here, and the determination to resist. But military experts say a broken bridge won't be enough to stop the Russians, and there is no doubt that they have Kyiv in their sights.

Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle said: ""Every parliamentarian wants to hear directly from the president, who will be speaking to us live from Ukraine, so this is an important opportunity for the House.
""Thanks again to our incredible staff for working at pace to make this historic address possible.""
His counterpart in the House of Lords, Lord McFall of Alcluith, said: ""Today we are not members of the House of Lords or Commons, we are parliamentarians, united in solidarity with Ukraine.""

""There will be no quiet place on Earth for you, except for the grave,"" the president said.
On Monday evening, Mr Johnson spoke with US President Joe Biden, French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, with the four leaders agreeing to maintain pressure on Russia to isolate Mr Putin diplomatically and economically. 
""The prime minister stressed that our goal must be ensuring Putin's failure in this act of aggression against Ukraine,"" said a No 10 spokeswoman.

The monarch greeted Canada's Justin Trudeau with a handshake
The Queen posed in front of blue and yellow flowers, the national colours of Ukraine, as she held her first in-person meeting at Windsor Castle since falling ill with Covid.
On whether this was a symbolic show of support, a Royal source indicated it was unlikely to be accidental.
The 95-year-old monarch was pictured smiling warmly at the Canadian PM as he held her right hand in both of his.
Justin Trudeau was visiting for talks with the UK PM about the Ukraine war.
The monarch, who is also Queen of Canada, tested positive for Covid-19 on 20 February and has carried out only ""light duties"" since then, cancelling several events. 
She carried out her first virtual engagements on 1 March before Monday's face-to-face meeting.

During the audience at Windsor Castle's Oak Room, Mr Trudeau was also pictured laughing as the Queen gestured towards herself.
The Queen was not seen with the walking stick which she has been using recently.
Asked later at a Downing Street news conference about his meeting with the monarch, Mr Trudeau said: ""She was as insightful and perspicacious as ever, very interested in what is going on, asked me all sorts of questions about Canada.
""We had a really useful - for me anyway - conversation about global events, as we always do.""
As well as this gesture of support for Ukraine at the meeting, the Queen previously made a donation to the Disasters Emergency Committee appeal to help people fleeing the conflict in Ukraine.
She has two high-profile events scheduled in the coming weeks: the Commonwealth Service on 14 March and the Duke of Edinburgh's memorial service on 29 March, both at Westminster Abbey.
Last month, she reached her Platinum Jubilee after 70 years on the throne.

109,109,Ukraine conflict: Petrol at fresh record as oil and gas prices soar,"Mon, 07 Mar 2022 16:48:24 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-60642786,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-60642786?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,"Investors fear a global economic shock, with rising fuel bills causing more pain for households.","Ukraine conflict: Petrol at fresh record as oil and gas prices soar
Petrol prices have hit another record high as oil and gas costs soar amid fears of a global economic shock from Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
Oil jumped to $139 a barrel at one point, the highest level for almost 14 years, while wholesale gas prices for next-day delivery more than doubled.
It came as the US hinted at a ban on buying Russian energy, as it looked to other countries to increase supplies.
However, European leaders rejected that idea on Monday. 
German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said Europe had ""deliberately exempted"" Russian energy from sanctions because its supply cannot be secured ""any other way"" at the moment. 
And Netherlands prime minister Mark Rutte said: ""The painful reality is we are still very much dependent on Russian gas and Russian oil and if you now force European companies to quit doing business with Russia that would have enormous ramifications around Europe including Ukraine but also around the world.
""We have to reduce our dependency. That will take time,"" he added. 
Market turmoil
UK petrol prices have hit an average of 155p a litre, the AA motoring group said.
The market turmoil is fuelling concerns that the price of many everyday items from food to petrol and heating, already rising at their fastest rate for 30 years, could be pushed higher.
Analysts have already warned that UK energy bills could reach as high as £3,000 a year due to the surge in oil and gas prices. 
Russia is the world's second top producer of crude oil after Saudi Arabia, and supplies about a third of Europe's needs. The price of Brent crude rose by more than a fifth last week amid fears of a reduction in Russian supplies.
After peaking at $139.13 a barrel early on Monday, the price of Brent crude - an international benchmark - fell back to around $125.
Ukraine war 'catastrophic for global food'
EU mulls weaponising energy in Russia crisis
The latest rise in UK petrol prices has pushed the cost to more than £7 a gallon, the AA said. Filling up a car with a 55-litre tank now costs nearly £17 more than a year ago, rising from £68.60 to £85.59.
The boss of fuel delivery firm Portland Fuel, James Spencer, told the BBC he thought fuel prices could reach £1.70-£1.75 a litre. ""Even if we can get extra [oil] supplies on to the market, nothing will happen quickly."" 
He said that, to a certain extent, individual car drivers have options to cut their use by driving less, but added that businesses that have no alternatives were really starting to feel the squeeze.
The crisis continues to affect share markets. The main stock exchanges in France and Germany sank more than 4% in early trading before paring their losses, closing 1.3% and 2% lower respectively. 
In London, the FTSE 100 dropped more than 2%, but then recovered to close 0.4% lower. Last week, the FTSE had its worse week since the start of the pandemic in March 2020.
In the US, markets ended lower with the Dow Jones and S&P 500 down 2.4% and 3% respectively. The Dow is now in a ""correction"", having fallen 10% since its last record closing level on 4 January.
The price of gold, a haven in troubled times for investors looking for security, hit $2,000 an ounce for the first time in almost 18 months.
These are massive movements in the price of commodities - the raw materials that eventually feed, warm and transport us.
The extra movements this morning arose out of talk of an embargo on Russian oil. That is very significant, because Russia is the second biggest world exporter. Anyone passing a petrol station would have seen the impact. If there was an actual embargo, the price of an average tank could head close to £100, and indeed is already there at the most expensive service stations in the UK.
But we don't need to be physically reliant on actual Russian supplies for it to feed through into the prices our suppliers pay and then pass on to us. The price for gas in international markets was already at incredible highs last week. It further increased by a third to frankly frightening levels, 10- to 15-times normal, above £6 per therm. 
If in the first half of this year these prices average £3.20, then typical dual fuel bills in October could rise to £3,000 a year or £250 a month.
On Sunday, the US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the Biden administration and its allies were discussing a ban on Russian oil supplies.
The comments came as pressure grows on the White House and other Western nations to take tougher action against Moscow over its invasion of Ukraine.
A Russian oil embargo would be a major escalation in the response to the invasion of Ukraine and would potentially have a major impact on the global economy. 
However, some European countries are reluctant given their dependence on Russian energy supplies. 
""While the US might just push through a ban on Russian oil imports, Europe can ill-afford to do the same. More worryingly, [Russian leader Vladimir] Putin, with his back to the wall, could turn off gas supplies to Europe, cutting off the continent's energy lifeline,"" said Vandana Hari at oil markets analysis firm Vanda Insights.
Mr Johnson said Europe could not simply shut down the use of oil and gas overnight, but that countries should move together quickly to look beyond Russia for its oil and gas supplies.
On Sunday, energy giant Shell defended its decision to purchase Russian crude oil despite the invasion of Ukraine.
The company said it was forced to buy oil from Russia in order to maintain timely supplies of fuel to Europe.
""To be clear, without an uninterrupted supply of crude oil to refineries, the energy industry cannot assure continued provision of essential products to people across Europe over the weeks ahead,"" a spokesperson added.
A possible ban on buying Russian oil has intensified pressure to find alternative supplies. 
The US is this week expected to press Saudi Arabia to increase crude production, and there is fresh impetus for a deal over Iran's nuclear ambitions that would lift sanctions on its oil exports.
However, progress on a deal has been hampered after Russia sought a US guarantee that the sanctions it faces over the Ukraine conflict will not affect its trade with Tehran.

Watch: Boris Johnson says the UK ""has always been very generous"" to those fleeing war
Boris Johnson has promised to be ""very generous"" towards Ukrainian refugees, amid criticism over the number who have been granted visas.
The Home Office says 300 visas have been issued since Russia invaded Ukraine - up from 50 on Sunday.
The figure comes amid confusion over whether access will be widened beyond the current schemes.
Labour says the situation regarding refugees is a ""mess"" and that clearer rules are urgently needed.
The two UK schemes announced so far require Ukrainians either to have family in the UK, or have a designated UK sponsor for their application. Only the family scheme is in operation so far.
Where have Ukraine's 1.7 million refugees gone?
What is the UK doing for Ukrainian refugees?
Ukraine refugees can stay in UK for three years
Home Secretary Priti Patel told the Sun, external she was examining ""legal options"" to grant humanitarian access to people ""without ties to the UK"".
But the prime minister did not confirm whether a third route would be set up when questioned on Monday, saying only that the UK would have a ""very generous and open approach"" to refugees.
However, Boris Johnson said the UK would not ""abandon controls altogether"" on those wanting to come to the country, adding it was ""sensible"" to ""have some basic ability to check who is coming in and who isn't"".
More than 1.7 million people have fled Ukraine since Russia invaded, according to the United Nations.
Most are in neighbouring countries, with the Polish border agency saying on Monday that more than one million people have now crossed into Poland.
Foreign Office Minister James Cleverly said Ukrainian refugees preferred to stay in the region - and the UK was providing humanitarian support to those in neighbouring countries.
The UK has steadily increased its visa offer to refugees.
This includes widening the range of family members that allow Ukrainians with relatives in the UK to apply for visas and creating a the second route allowing UK-based organisations to sponsor applications - with details to be set out this week.
But the government has faced criticism that its offer of help is less generous than the EU's.
The UK had been warning about a possible Russian invasion of Ukraine for many weeks. 
The likelihood of a refugee crisis was known. 
And yet there is a sense of Whitehall scrambling to refit its new immigration and asylum policy to the reality of refugees fleeing war in Europe. 
In contrast to the EU's policy, Ukrainians wanting to come to the UK need a visa - obtained either through existing family links or a sponsor. 
But Home Secretary Priti Patel told the Sun newspaper she was considering a new route for refugees to come to the UK. 
Cue a day of confusion as ministers insisted that wasn't the case. 
The problem could be the ambiguity of Ms Patel's words. 
Or it reveals confusion within Whitehall about what should be done as the exodus from Ukraine continues and public concern grows.
The Home Office said 8,900 applications had been submitted for visas via the Ukraine Family Scheme, with 300 issued so far.
It added that it had ""surged"" staff in nearby countries to process cases as quickly as possible.
But Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the  government should be offering a ""simple route to sanctuary"" for people in danger.
""The Home Office is in a complete mess about this. They keep changing the rules,"" he said. 
""The government now talking about a third route is something that we've been talking about now for days.""
The government is also facing pressure over the situation in Calais, where there now are more than 500 Ukrainians hoping to get to the UK.

The chart-topping rapper had denied assault by beating
Grime artist Dizzee Rascal has been found guilty of assaulting his former partner.
The rapper, whose real name is Dylan Kwabena Mills, attacked Cassandra Jones at a property in Streatham, south London, in June 2021.
The 37-year-old, of Sevenoaks, Kent, ""barged"" his way into the house, put his forehead against Ms Jones' and ""pushed her to the ground"".
The couple had two children before they split up in February 2021.
At Wimbledon Magistrates' Court on Monday, the musician - whose chart-topping singles have included Bonkers and Dance Wiv Me - had denied assault by beating.
The court heard Mills ""barged"" his way into the property on 8 June, with his son under his arms before ""screaming and shouting"" and banging his own head on the fridge three times.
He then approached Ms Jones, ""put his forehead against hers and pushed her around the room"" and then ""pushed her to the ground"", the court heard.
He had accused her of causing injuries to his arm.
The grime artist was made an MBE for services to music in the Queen's Birthday Honours in 2020
The court heard how Ms Jones began filming him but he took her phone from her and then took the phone from her mother, Dawn Kirk, who was there.
The shouting became so loud it alerted two neighbours and police were called.
When they arrived, Mills said ""I'm the aggressor"", but later gave a prepared statement in a police interview, denying the allegations and claimed he had been assaulted by Ms Jones, the court heard.
Delivering her verdict, District Judge Polly Gledhill said Mills had lost his temper in an argument over child contact and finances.
She added he was ""abusive and aggressive"" and ""assaulted her as outlined by the Crown"".
Following the verdict, Mills took a camera from a Press Association photographer outside the court and threw it into a road, smashing it.
A Press Association photographer said Mills smashed his camera outside court
Photographer, James Manning, said: ""He came out of the court, I was taking his picture, just standing still on the corner.
""He then pushed my camera into my face, which then caused it to fall to the floor, at which point he then picked it up and then threw it across the road. It smashed into a lot of pieces.
""He was angry, he came straight out of the door, didn't say anything, didn't say anything until the point at which he pushed my camera.
""I think he said something like 'get away' or 'get out of my face' or something along those lines.""
Det Con Hannah Barton said she wanted to ""praise the woman who Mills assaulted - she has shown immense strength throughout this investigation"".
""No woman should be subjected to violence of any form and I would urge anyone who finds themselves in this position to trust police - we will investigate and you will be provided with the support you need to help you through,"" she added.
Mills released his debut album, Boy In Da Corner, in 2003, and is due to release his seventh album later this year.
In 2020, he was made an MBE for services to music in the Queen's Birthday Honours.
He will be sentenced at Croydon Magistrates' Court on 8 April.

Ed Sheeran gave evidence at the High Court on Monday
Ed Sheeran has told the High Court he does not ""borrow"" ideas from unknown songwriters without credit.
The singer-songwriter has been accused by two other songwriters of copying parts of his 2017 hit Shape Of You.
Sami Chokri and Ross O'Donoghue's barrister suggested Sheeran treated lesser-known songwriters differently from famous ones.
Sheeran denied this, telling the court he had cleared parts of songs with ""lots"" of unknown artists.
Shape of You was number one for 14 weeks in the UK in 2017, becoming the best-selling song of the year around the world.

Chokri and O'Donoghue claim the song's ""Oh I"" hook is ""strikingly similar"" to part of their track Oh Why, which was released by Chokri under the name Sami Switch in 2015.

On Friday, their barrister Andrew Sutcliffe QC claimed Sheeran ""borrows ideas and throws them into his songs, sometimes he will acknowledge it but sometimes he won't"".
But Sheeran denied the claim that he is a ""magpie"" who lifts other people's work without acknowledgment, pointing out that he has often shared credit with lesser-known artists, including Shivers and Visiting Hours, and a song that sampled an ""unknown composer's"" work from Buffy The Vampire Slayer.
""All those examples are not famous artists that we've cleared songs with and that's what I have to say on that,"" he told the court.
Sami Chokri performs under the name Sami Switch
Sheeran created Shape of You with co-writers Steve Mac - real name Steven McCutcheon - and Snow Patrol's Johnny McDaid, both of whom were also in court.
After its release, Sheeran added the team behind TLC's 1999 single No Scrubs to the song's writing credits after some commentators pointed out similarities.
On Monday, Mr Sutcliffe told the star: ""The evidence is overwhelming that at the time of writing Shape of You, your songwriting process involved collecting ideas.""
Sheeran replied: ""You say it's overwhelming, I don't agree with that.""
'Completely fair'
In written evidence, the singer said the contested element of Shape of You was ""very short"", and the relevant parts of both songs were ""entirely commonplace"".
He said: ""Even so, if I had heard Oh Why at the time and had referenced it, I would have taken steps to clear it.""
He added: ""I have always tried to be completely fair in crediting anyone who makes any contribution to any song I write.
""I do refer to other works on occasion when I write, as do many songwriters. If there is a reference to another work, I notify my team so that steps can be taken to obtain clearance.
""I have been as scrupulous as I possibly can and have even given credits to people who I believe may have been no more than a mere influence for a songwriting element. This is because I want to treat other songwriters fairly.""
Dressed in a sharp black suit, Ed Sheeran is firm, determined and just a little bit irritated on the stand as lawyers for Chokri and O'Donoghue deconstruct his songwriting process, looking for hints that he might take inspiration from outside sources.
Sheeran testifies that he mostly works in collaboration with other writers, and that it's often hard to identify who has written each individual part of a song once it's finished.
Referencing his Shape of You co-writer Johnny McDaid, he says: ""My and Johnny's writing partnership is very much like a game of tennis. He'll say something and I'll say something back. We're quite quick when we go back and forth.""
Asked repeatedly whether he is responsible for the chorus to his 2015 song Photograph, Sheeran replies tersely: ""I honestly couldn't tell you. I don't know. We wrote the song together."" It's a phrase he returns to several times throughout the morning's questioning.
Photograph is relevant because it was the subject of a separate copyright claim from Martin Harrington and Thomas Leonard, who wrote Matt Cardle's 2011 single Amazing. The duo were eventually given a share of the song's royalties and a £4m lump sum in an out-of-court settlement.
Sheeran says he settled the claim because it was a ""nuisance"" and ""more trouble than it was worth"". Asked why he would pay out such a ""substantial"" sum instead of taking the case to court, he says he did so on the advice of his lawyers.
Mr Sutcliffe said Sheeran had known about Chokri before Shape Of You was written because the grime artist had tweeted Sheeran directly, and the singer had given a shout out to Sami Switch on stage in 2011. But Sheeran replied: ""This isn't stuff that's true.""
Chokri had also appeared on YouTube channel SBTV at around the same time as Sheeran, who described its founder Jamal Edwards as his ""best friend"".
But he said the music entrepreneur, who died last month, didn't share songs like Oh Why with him. Instead, the pair would ""talk about football, talk about his mum, talk about theatre"", he said.
Sheeran was also asked about his role as a talent-spotter for his own label Gingerbread Man Records. He denied being aware of Oh Why, saying he had just signed Jamie Lawson to the label and ""wasn't looking for anyone else"" to work with.
The musician told the court he quit social media in 2015, adding that for ""the whole of 2016"" he was ""off"" social media and was using a ""flip phone from Tesco"".
In May 2018, Sheeran and his co-writers issued proceedings asking the High Court to declare they had not infringed Chokri and O'Donoghue's copyright.
The pair then issued a counter claim for copyright infringement. The trial is expected to continue for about three weeks.

Pressure is growing on Western food and drink giants to pull out of Russia due to the invasion of Ukraine.
McDonald's and Coca-Cola have been criticised on social media for failing to speak out about the attacks and continuing to operate in the country.
Well-known firms including Netflix and Levi's have already suspended sales or stopped providing services in Russia.
McDonald's and Coca-Cola have not responded to the BBC's request for comment.
#BoycottMcDonalds and #BoycottCocaCola were trending on Twitter on Monday and over the weekend respectively.
Dragon's Den investor Deborah Meaden also spoke out on social media against the fizzy drinks company, urging people to stop drinking its products.

The criticism comes amid calls for other well-known Western firms such as KFC, Pepsi, Starbucks and Burger King to close their outlets and stop sales in Russia.
However, most firms have stayed silent on the issue with Pepsi, Starbucks and Burger King also declining to respond to the BBC's requests for comment.
Fast food chain KFC did not respond initially but its owner Yum Brands, which also owns Pizza Hut, has since announced that it has suspended future investments in Russia.
Yum Brands is the world's second-biggest restaurant chain, and there are about 1,000 KFC outlets and 50 Pizza Hut restaurants in Russia. The company was not pulling out entirely, but Yum said that it would ""redirect all profits from operations in Russia to humanitarian efforts"". It is also donating $1m (£762,000) to the Red Cross.
Big presence
Many of the firms the BBC has contacted have a large number of stores in the country.
In recently-published information on its website, external, McDonald's said that it has 847 stores in Russia. The company also owns the majority of these outlets, whereas across the rest of the world most are typically operated by franchisees.
Both McDonald's and Pepsi, who have had a presence in Russia for decades, have also been singled out by the boss of New York state's pension fund.
The oldest Russian McDonald's branch, off Pushkin Square in central Moscow, opened in 1990.
Thomas DiNapoli, comptroller of the New York state common retirement fund, wrote letters to the companies, according to Reuters reports, urging them to review their businesses in Russia because they face ""significant and growing legal, compliance, operational, human rights and personnel, and reputational risks"".
Often, franchise owners will be able to take the decision as to whether or not to shut chains down, depending on terms of agreements they might have with big food chains like KFC or Starbucks.
In a recent statement, Kevin Johnson, the boss of Starbucks, described attacks on Ukraine as ""unprovoked"" and ""unjust"".
But most of its sites in Russia remain open, according to its website. Most of these franchises are run by the Kuwait-based Alshaya Group.
Kathleen Brooks, director at Minerva Analysis, said McDonald's and Coca-Cola were ""very complicated businesses"", which would not make it easy to make a decision to leave Russia quickly.
She told the BBC's Today programme that Coca-Cola had an ""incredibly complicated structure"" with bottling plants in Russia.
""I don't think it's as simple as saying can you just pull out of Russia,"" she said. ""These are complicated businesses and there's a lot to consider, but right now the reputation risk could really hit their share prices so they may have no choice going forward.""
'Ethical compass'
But Dr Ian Peters, director of the Institute for Business Ethics, told BBC News: ""This is not a time to sit on the fence. 
""The world is likely to judge companies by what they do in such circumstances, and ethical judgement will be as important as complying with any government-led regulations and sanctions.""
He said that most firms would have what they refer to as an ""ethical compass"" they use to make big decisions.
""We would advise firms in such circumstances always to look at the bigger picture and seek to do the right thing, putting the wider interest above short-term profit,"" he added.
He cited important ethical dilemmas that might come up for companies when considering to suspend operations in Russia too: What duty of care do these companies hold to employees on the ground? Is it fair to deprive Russian citizens of basic goods?
Professor of business ethics at Henley Business School, Kleio Akrivou, suggested that these types of decisions might be more difficult to reach for food companies than, say, consulting firms.
""When it comes to sanctions which deprive the Russian population of its basic goods and dignity, firms may need to approach the situation more thoughtfully, with an appeal to practical reason.""
She said now is the time for fast food giants to balance how real people are affected by such moves, alongside any reputational risk.

Boris Johnson says no European country had done more than the UK to settle vulnerable people since 2015
Prime Minister Boris Johnson has called for a ""step-by-step"" move away from dependence on Russian oil and gas as a result of the Ukraine war.
After talks with the Canadian and Dutch PMs, Mr Johnson said nations have to work together to secure alternatives.
Canada's PM Justin Trudeau said Europe did not want to repeat its mistake of being too dependent on Russia.
But Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte warned forcing a boycott now would have ""enormous consequences"".
And in Germany, Chancellor Olaf Scholz cautioned against banning Russian oil and gas.
In a statement, he said Europe had ""deliberately exempted"" Russian energy from sanctions because its supply cannot be secured ""any other way"" at the moment.

Meanwhile, Russia warned that oil prices could surge to $300 a barrel and it might close the main gas pipeline to Germany if the West halted oil imports over the invasion of Ukraine. 
""Foregoing Russian oil will have catastrophic consequences for the world market,"" said Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak.
Mr Johnson's call came at a Downing Street news conference after he, Mr Trudeau, and Mr Rutte discussed new sanctions against Russia and aid for Ukraine.
Asked about claims that the US was in active discussions with European nations about banning imports of Russian oil, Mr Johnson said Western allies are ""moving very, very fast"" - and things which weeks ago would not have been considered are ""now very much on the table"".
He said he would set out a new energy supply strategy in the coming days, saying the UK was looking at using more of its own fossil fuels. 
But he said the UK was not abandoning its commitment to cut carbon emissions.
The UK gets less than 5% of its gas from Russia - but for EU countries the figure is about 40%.
Mr Rutte told the news conference the change would have to be ""diligent and not overnight"", combined with a faster uptake of renewable energy.
An immediate change would ""basically undermine supply chains the world over, particularly in Europe,"" he said, adding: ""It would also have an impact on Ukraine itself.""
Mr Johnson also announced a further £175m of UK support for Ukraine and Mr Trudeau said Canada would sanction 10 more Russian oligarchs and officials.
Later the prime minister joined a call with Mr Scholz, US President Joe Biden and French President Emmanuel Macron, where they said they were determined to continue raising the cost on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine.
Mr Johnson said previously unthinkable options for Western leaders were now ""very much on the table""
Western nations are facing calls to do more as Russia continues its bombardment of Ukrainian cities. 
The UK has also been criticised after it emerged that only about 50 refugees have been granted visas to enter the country as of Sunday.
During a visit to an RAF station with his fellow leaders, Mr Johnson said the UK was ""processing thousands"" and would be ""very generous"" to refugees, but would not let people in without any checks.
What sanctions are being imposed on Russia?
Will new legal powers find Putin's loot?
The government has so far announced two main schemes for people fleeing Ukraine to come to the UK - one which allows family members of people settled in the UK to join them and the other which allows organisations to sponsor a Ukrainian's entry.
Home Office sources have said they are in the early stages of exploring a scheme to provide humanitarian access to people fleeing the conflict.
But a senior government source told the BBC the focus was still on the two schemes for Ukrainian refugees that have already been announced, and the need for further action was being kept under review.
Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the Home Office was in a ""complete mess"" and the government must establish a ""simple route to sanctuary"", while Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the UK was ""not doing anywhere near enough"" to help refugees.
More than 1.5 million people have fled Ukraine since the invasion began, according to the UN refugee agency.

Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer says the Home Office is in a ""complete mess"" over how Ukrainians can get to the UK
Meanwhile, MPs are expected to vote later on the Economic Crime Bill, which aims to make it easier to sanction individuals.
In recent days, the government has announced asset freezes and travel bans on a number of oligarchs - but has faced accusations of being too slow to sanction those with links to President Putin.

The bill will set up a new register that will mean foreign owners of UK property must declare and verify their identities with Companies House. 
MPs are expected to vote through all stages of the bill in a single sitting. 
Labour said it would support the legislation, but wanted the proposed timeframe for property owners to register to be cut from six months to 28 days.

Jeremy Bowen was on the frontline in Irpin as residents came under Russian fire while trying to flee
On day 12 of the invasion, there was no let-up in the Russian shelling of major population centres, despite a proposal from Moscow to create safe escape routes.
Mariupol, Volnovakha, Sumy and Kharkiv spent another day under fierce attack, which prevented the evacuation of civilians, said Ukraine's foreign ministry.
Russia said earlier that humanitarian corridors would allow people to leave some of the threatened areas. 
But Ukraine branded the proposal ""immoral"" after it emerged many of the routes would only take civilians to Russia or its ally, Belarus.
It urged all countries to put pressure on Moscow for a ceasefire. 
The mayor of Irpin, a beleaguered town on the north-western outskirts of Kyiv, said 1,000 people had been taken to safety. He said Ukrainian forces had repelled Russian attacks and they had pulled back. 
Residents of Irpin have been fleeing the Russian assault on their city, which is half an hour's drive from the capital.
You can read Orla Guerin's account of their struggle here.
The Ukrainians said other towns in the area, including Bucha and Hostomel, were in Russian hands and the situation was critical. 
Rescue workers say at least 13 people were killed when an air strike hit an industrial bakery west of the capital, Kyiv. 
Angry Zelensky vows to punish Russian atrocities
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said everyone who commits atrocities against Ukraine's civilians will be punished.
He said Ukrainians would not forgive or forget and accused invading Russian troops of deliberate murder.
""There will be no quiet place on Earth for you. Except for the grave,"" the president said.
Ukrainian officials say Russia is striking civilian targets around the country, including hospitals, nurseries and schools.
But Russia denies targeting civilians, saying it is carrying out a ""special military operation"" against Ukrainian ""nationalists"" and ""neo-Nazis"".
Meanwhile, delegations from Russia and Ukraine have held a third round of talks in Belarus with little progress. 
Contacts between the two sides have so far come to nothing, with Russia insisting it will only stop the invasion if Ukraine meets all its demands. 
Chernobyl workers' 12-day ordeal under Russian guard

More than 100 workers at Ukraine's Chernobyl nuclear power plant - the site of the world's worst nuclear disaster in 1986 - have been stuck there for more than 12 days, unable to leave after Russian forces seized the plant on the first day of the invasion.
Another 200 Ukrainian guards, who'd been in charge of security at the time of the assault, also remain trapped.
Workers continue to go about their duties and the atmosphere is said to be calm, but the BBC has been told that the conditions inside are difficult, with food and medicine limited.
'I never thought I would leave my home like this'
Dusia Kostiuk, 91, travelled from Kharkiv to Lviv on her way to Poland
Despite the fierce fighting, huge numbers of Ukrainians are on the move.
The western city of Lviv has reached the limit of its capacity to help refugees displaced by the Russian invasion, its mayor, Andriy Sadoviy, said on Monday.
Hundreds of thousands of displaced people have flowed into Lviv since the invasion began, putting a huge strain on the city's resources.
Among them was 91-year-old Dusia Kostiuk, who spent 27 hours on a train from the heavily bombed city of Kharkiv.
""Our house was still there when we left but shelling was happening all around and we were told that terrible shelling is happening there now,"" she told the BBC's Joel Gunter.
""We didn't take anything with us, I took two dresses and that's it. 
""I was born and raised in Kharkiv. I didn't really travel before, I don't like to travel. I never thought I would leave my home like this.""

Oil price highest for more than a decade
On the global financial markets, the impact of the war is still being felt.
Oil and gas costs have been soaring amid fears of a global economic shock from Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
Oil jumped to $139 (£106) a barrel at one point on Monday, the highest level for almost 14 years, while wholesale gas prices for next-day delivery more than doubled.
The price surge came as the US hinted at a ban on buying Russian energy, with other countries urged to increase supplies.
However, not all EU countries are ready to enforce such a ban.
Big powers Germany and Italy - far more reliant on Russian energy than most - feel more threatened by the prospect of skyrocketing energy prices that would surely follow any sanctions on Russian oil or gas imports, as the BBC's Katya Adler reports.

In Russia, the ""Z"" is fast becoming seen as a staunchly pro-war symbol of President Putin's invasion of Ukraine. It has been sported by politicians, seen on the sides of cars, vans and advertising hoardings - as well as daubed on bus shelters. It has even been used by Serbs at pro-Russian demonstration in Belgrade. Photographs have been widely shared on social media.
It has become a social media conversation, says Aglaya Snetkova, a lecturer in international politics at the School of Slavonic and Eastern European Studies at UCL. ""In many ways, this shows the extent to which Russia is, or has been, very much part of the global world.""
While zed in the Russian Cyrillic alphabet is written differently - and looks like a 3 - most Russians recognise Latin letters. Emily Ferris - Russia and Eurasia research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) - says the ""Z"" is a powerful and easily recognisable symbol.
""Often with propaganda the simplest things catch on the quickest,"" she says. ""It looks rather intimidating and quite stark. From an aesthetic perspective, it's a very powerful symbol.""
It has taken less than a fortnight for the ""Z"" to spread among those supportive of President Putin's invasion.
In the central Russian city of Kazan, about 60 children and staff at a hospice were photographed outside in the snow forming a giant ""Z"" in front of their building.
Several theories have circulated as to what the ""Z"" symbol actually means. It first caught attention on social media after Russian tanks with ""Zs"" on the side were spotted en route to Ukraine.
Initially, it was thought that the ""Z"" was in fact a number ""2"" - representing the 22 February (22/02/2022). That was the day Russia ratified an agreement on ""friendship, cooperation and mutual assistance"" with the self-proclaimed breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine - Donetsk and Luhansk.
But it is now believed the symbol is simply a way for Russia's military to identify its own forces. 
Last week, viewers to a news programme on Russia's state-controlled Channel One were told that a ""Z"" was a common marking on Russian military equipment. The Orthodox Christian pro-Putin website Tsargrad told readers the simple marking could ""avoid friendly fire"" and couldn't be ""mixed up with anything else"".
Russian special forces veteran Sergey Kuvykin told the Russian magazine website, Life, that different symbols signified different military units. ""Symbols like these are used - a 'Z' in a square, a 'Z' in a circle, a 'Z' with a star or simply 'Z' on its own."" He said the markings helped make sure that troops, who might not be in contact with other comrades, were where they should be. 
Russian warplanes fly too quickly to see the daubed white markings, says US Air Force Lt Col Tyson Wetzel - a senior Air Force fellow with The Atlantic Council think tank. But, in an interview with the Task and Purpose, external website, he agrees the ""Zs"" are a ""de-confliction measure to help prevent fratricide"" - friendly fire from Russian attack helicopters or artillery.
The spread of ""Z"" in Russia has not only been because of social media spontaneity - cautions Aglaya Snetkov from UCL. 
""It has also been pushed by the regime."" 
One Russian politician, Maria Butina, shared a video of how to write the ""Z"" insignia on a business jacket - she explains - ""so you can go into work and show it to everyone without shouting about it.""
But Ms Snetkov says the symbol shouldn't be seen as fascist. ""There are lots of memes transforming the 'Z' into a swastika, but that's done by people who want to push back against the regime.""
And there are other symbols appearing, too. 
The letter ""V"" for instance - also not in the Cyrillic alphabet - appears in posts on the official Instagram account, external of the Russian department of defence, alongside images of ""Zs"". 
There are written captions. ""Za PatsanoV"" reads one, meaning ""for the lads"" - while another says ""Sila V pravde"", which translates into English as ""strength in truth"".
One theory is that the two Latin letters might stand for ""vostok"", meaning east, and ""zapad"", meaning west. But on social media, external, it has also been suggested that the Ukrainian military believes the ""Z"" refers to Russia's ""Eastern Forces"" - and the ""V"" to the ""Naval infantry"".

119,119,Ukraine war: Chernobyl workers' 12-day ordeal under Russian guard,"Mon, 07 Mar 2022 19:40:11 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-60638949,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-60638949?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,"The nuclear power plant was seized on day one of Russia's invasion, and workers have not left since.","Ukraine war: Chernobyl workers' 12-day ordeal under Russian guard
Russian troops have surrounded the perimeter of the plant
More than 100 workers at Ukraine's Chernobyl nuclear power plant - the site of the world's worst nuclear disaster in 1986 - have been stuck there for more than 12 days, unable to leave after Russian forces seized the plant on the first day of the invasion. 
Another 200 Ukrainian guards, who'd been in charge of security at the time of the assault, also remain trapped. 
Workers continue to go about their duties and the atmosphere is said to be calm, but the BBC has been told that the conditions inside are difficult, with food and medicine limited. 
There are also growing concerns that stress could be impacting their ability to safely carry out their duties at the nuclear site. 
'Complicated and tense situation'
Russian soldiers are now inside the 32km (19 mile) Chernobyl exclusion zone and have surrounded the perimeter of the plant. 
Russia says it has secured the site jointly with the Ukrainian national guard, but Ukraine disputes this and says Russian troops have full control. 
The relative of one of the workers stuck at the plant - who we are not naming for safety reasons - told the BBC that the Russian side was willing to let them swap shifts, but that they could not guarantee their safety on the journey home, nor of workers travelling to take their place. 
The train between Slavutych and Chernobyl travels briefly through Belarus, a major Russia ally. 
Although no longer a working power station, Chernobyl  was never fully abandoned and still requires constant management. In fact, after reactor number four exploded 36 years ago, its other reactors continued to operate for a few years, and a whole town - Slavutych - was built to house workers who were evacuated after the accident.
These days, around 2,400 people still work at the site: scientists, technicians, cooks, medics and other support staff, plus members of the national guard. 
In normal times, workers would board a train from Slavutych at the start of their shift, and return home afterwards. But for the employees who were there when the Russians invaded, everything suddenly changed - they were forced to live on site. 
""The situation is complicated and tense,"" Yuri Fomichev, Mayor of Slavutych, told the BBC. ""It is difficult for them morally, psychologically and physically.""
The workers do have some food on site, but because they don't know how long they will be there for, they are limiting themselves to one meal a day (prepared by cooks who are also stuck), and the food is said to be basic - mainly bread and porridge. 
Conditions are tough for the Ukrainian workers and national guard members at the power station
On Sunday, Russian personnel offered a delivery of food, but the Ukrainian workers turned it down, saying it was a propaganda stunt.
The facilities are not set up for sleeping, so temporary dormitories have been created, with some sleeping on camp beds and tables, others on the floor. 
In order to get some down-time, the workers have split themselves into shifts, with one group working while another rests. 
For the employees' families in nearby Slavutych, it is a difficult time. 
""Some of the workers require medication which is limited at the plant, and that adds extra worries for the relatives,"" said Mr Fomichev. 
""We have to tell them that there is currently no safe way of getting the workers out of there.""
Is the Chernobyl site at risk? 
With workers feeling the physical and psychological effects of nearly two weeks stuck at work on a decommissioned nuclear power plant, there are fears that the stress could be impacting their ability to safely carry out their duties. 
""Under these conditions, the workers' concentration gets worse and worse, and that is a threat to safety,"" said Mayor Fomichev. 
""It may not be a working power plant, but it still requires a lot of attention to make sure all systems are working normally,"" he added. 
The director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Rafael Grossi, has repeatedly stressed the need for staff to be able to rest in order to carry out their jobs safely, and in an interview with the BBC he said he had been in touch with the Russian side to communicate that message. 
But nuclear experts say that because this is not an active nuclear power plant, the danger to public health is limited. 
""It's not good that people aren't changing shift and that people are working with Russian soldiers around them, but I don't see a big danger,"" said James Smith, Professor of environmental science at the University of Portsmouth, who has been studying Chernobyl for many years and has been to the site many times. 
""The last reactor shut down in the year 2000, so the spent nuclear fuel... is not significantly heat-generating any more,"" he said, explaining that this makes it extremely unlikely that a major release of radioactivity could occur. 
Radiation levels did spike in the region when the power station was seized, due to heavy military equipment disturbing the contaminated dust around the site. However, Professor Smith said they did not rise to concerning levels. 
Exhaustion and desperation
The risk of a major nuclear catastrophe may be low, but for the workers stuck inside and their families the emotional cost is very real. 
""All the staff are super exhausted and desperate. They doubt that anyone cares about them. Right now they don't see anyone doing anything to rescue them,"" the relative of one employee said. 
In a BBC interview, she appealed to the IAEA to intervene so the current workers could safely leave, with another group taking over. 
IAEA chief Rafael Grossi said he was in contact with the Ukrainian and Russian sides in an attempt to manage safety both at Chernobyl, and at Ukraine's active nuclear power plants, where experts say the consequences of open conflict could be more serious. 
However, nothing definitive has been agreed.

""No-one can help us in Calais.""","Ukrainians on way to UK hit paperwork dead-end in Calais
The Raminishvili family are stuck in Calais
Misha Raminishvili was close to despair, his daughter in tears, as the news came through. His wife Maria had a vacant look in her eyes that spoke of a nightmare journey still without a final destination. 
""No visa for at least another week,"" he said, simply. ""No-one can help us in Calais."" 
I met Misha, with his Ukrainian wife Maria and two children, at a hostel in the French port which is accommodating 137 Ukrainian refugees.  
Misha has a house in Hornchurch, east London, but lives between there and Kyiv.
He and his son, Misha Jr, have UK passports. But his wife Maria, and daughter Gabrielle, do not - and therefore need visas to enter the UK, which require biometric checks.
Misha has been stuck in Calais for five days, unable to get his family across the Channel, in what would be the last leg of a journey that began on 24 February.
At the start of that journey, Maria walked 45 miles to Ukraine's border with Romania before Misha reached her.
""I feel left out,"" Misha told me in Calais. ""Who else is going to help me if not my own government?""
Misha Raminishvili and his son can enter the UK, but his wife and daughter can not
More than 500 Ukrainian refugees are currently in Calais, hoping to get to the UK.  
Among them are families with small children and babies, as well as elderly women who have fled the war and crossed a continent.  
Many tell of having attempted to reach Britain, only to have been turned back by Border Force officials because they didn't have the right paperwork.
Despite Home Secretary Priti Patel saying she had ""surged a Home Office team"" to help people on the ground in Calais - and denying that anyone had been turned back at the border - there is frustration and despair among those trying to navigate the bureaucracy.
A Home Office presence at a local administrative building disappeared this morning, a sign at the hostel advising people to go to Brussels or Paris to apply for a visa.  
Desperate refugees returned from the building to say they didn't know what to do - or where to go.
Eventually, Misha spoke to a Border Force official who advised him to head across town to the old port building.  
He has a car and was able to drive there. But when he arrived, the Home Office representation amounted to three men at a table in a deserted departure hall with bags of ready salted crisps and chocolate bars. 
When Misha asked them how he could get home to England with his family, he was told he could have an appointment in Paris on 15 March.
""Another week stuck here,"" Misha lamented. ""I have never claimed a benefit in my life and the first time I ask my government for their help, this is how they treat me. I am gutted.""

IN DEPTH: Full coverage of the conflict
The Home Office had promised refugees arriving in Calais there would be support available to help them complete the final leg of their long journeys.
However, a Home Office statement today announced: ""There is no visa application centre in Calais and people should not travel there. 
""Anyone wishing to make an application under the Ukraine Family Scheme should apply online and then to travel to their nearest visa application centre. 
""The only visa application centre in France is in Paris.""  
A charity worker from Care4Calais has become the focal point for many of the refugees in the hostel, but she too is frustrated by the lack of information and support from the UK authorities.  
The prime minister has said the UK government will be ""very, very generous"" in its approach to helping Ukrainian refugees come to the UK, but in Calais people fleeing the war and looking for sanctuary in Britain spoke of a different attitude from those at the border.

121,121,How many refugees have fled Ukraine and where are they going?,"Mon, 07 Mar 2022 17:22:16 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-60555472,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-60555472?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,The UN says four million people may try to escape the war in Ukraine.,"How many Ukrainian refugees are there and where have they gone?
At least 12 million people have fled their homes since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the United Nations (UN) says. 
More than five million have left for neighbouring countries, while seven million people are still thought to be displaced inside Ukraine itself. 
However, hundreds of thousands of refugees have returned to their home country - especially to cities like Kyiv.
Where are refugees going?
The UN says that, as of 4 July, external, more than 5.2 million refugees from Ukraine have been recorded across Europe. More than 3.5 million have applied for temporary residence in another country: 
Russia: (estimated) 1,412,425 Ukrainian refugees recorded
Poland: 1,194,642 
Moldova: 82,700
Romania: 83,321
Slovakia: 79,770
Hungary: 25,800
Belarus: 9,820 
Others have moved on to other countries, especially those who crossed into Poland, Hungary and Slovakia. These nations have open borders with other EU states, external. 
The UN says there are more than 867,000 Ukrainians in Germany, almost 382,768 in the Czech Republic and 141,562 in Italy. 
Some Ukrainians travelled to Russia from the regions of Luhansk and Donetsk, which are now mostly in the hands of pro-Russian separatist forces. 
President Vladimir Putin said his forces evacuated 140,000 civilians from Mariupol, external and insisted none of them was forced to go to Russia. However, volunteer groups, external say they have helped thousands of Ukrainians leave Russia.
What help are countries offering refugees?
The EU has granted Ukrainians the automatic right to stay and work throughout its 27 member nations for up to three years. 
Refugees are housed in reception centres if they can't stay with friends or relatives. They are given food and medical care, and information about onward travel.
They are entitled to social welfare payments and access to housing, medical treatment and schools.
Poland, one of the countries which has taken the highest number of refugees, and Moldova, which has the largest concentration of refugees by population, have asked for additional support. 
Hundreds of refugees were housed in this athletics centre in Moldova
How many people are returning to Ukraine?
The UN says that as of 21 June, there have been over 3 million ""cross-border movements"" back into Ukraine, external, but says this number does not refer to individual refugees.
Ukraine's border force had previously said people were crossing back into the country at a rate of about 30,000 a day.
Some are returning to areas of Ukraine such as the capital Kyiv, which were threatened by Russian army advances at the start of the war, but which are now considered safer. 
In May, Kyiv mayor Vitali Klitschko said the city's population was back to two-thirds of its pre-war level, external. 
Where are people fleeing inside Ukraine?
The UN's International Organisation for Migration (IOM) said in May that more than seven million people remain internally displaced, external:
27% of refugees were from the Kharkiv region
16% from Kyiv 
16% from the Donetsk region in eastern Ukraine
24% indicated their homes had been damaged or attacked in the war
The IOM estimates that more than half of the people who are internally displaced are women. Many are particularly vulnerable because they are pregnant or have small children, have a disability or are a victim of violence.
The UN is working alongside other organisations to provide cash, food and other supplies. 
The UN estimates that about eight million people are displaced inside Ukraine
What is the UK doing to help Ukrainian refugees?
The UK introduced a family visa scheme, external for Ukrainians who have an immediate or extended family member in the UK.
After the government response was criticised, it launched the Homes for Ukraine scheme to allow those without relatives in the UK to settle. 
People in the UK can nominate an individual or family to stay with them rent-free for at least six months.
Refugees who come via the scheme can live and work in the UK for up to three years, and get access to healthcare, welfare and schools.
Applications are made online, external, and both hosts and refugees are vetted. Hosts receive £350 a month.
Many families who have applied to be sponsors have complained that the system is too slow and complicated.
As of 28 June, the government had issued 142,500 Ukrainian visas, external out of 161,500 applications received, and as of 27 June, 86,600 visa holders had arrived in the UK.

Volodymyr Zelensky became the unlikely president of Ukraine in April 2019
A man with no political experience becoming the president of a country with a population of millions. 
If the political rise of Ukraine's president Volodymyr Zelensky sounds like the plot of a TV show - that's because it is.
Before taking Ukraine's top political job, President Zelensky was the star of Servant of the People - a comedy series which started in 2015, following a teacher who becomes president after a video of him ranting about politics goes viral.
It was broadcast in the UK for the first time on Sunday night on Channel 4, with 100,000 people tuning in to get the (fictional) backstory of the Mr Zelensky, according to official viewing figures.
One viewer told Radio 1 Newsbeat that watching the show made her ""admire him more,"" than she already did.
As president of Ukraine, President Zelensky has faced the invasion of Russian forces since his country was invaded in late February.

He has been praised by many for his handling of the war, delivering rallying cries to his citizens to ""drive this evil out"" and remaining in the capital city of Kyiv during attacks by the forces of Russia's President Putin.
World events are very likely to have been the leading factor in the decision by Channel 4 to broadcast the show now.

The name of the show - Servant of the People - is what Zelensky later decided to name his real political party when he ran for president in 2019.
Broadcasters in countries around the world are now racing to buy the rights to show it. 
Melanie Daffin was one of the thousands who watched along as Servant of the People aired in the UK on Sunday night. 
Melanie said she will be watching all episodes of Servant of the People
""I'd seen clips of the show on TikTok so I was quite excited to see Channel 4 had got the rights to it,"" the 22-year-old told Radio 1 Newsbeat.
""It's very weird watching him be this funny guy when what we're seeing now is him being this serious leader. 
'World leaders could take note'
""It makes me admire him more, going from one side of the spectrum to another - being a comedian to being someone who is admired on the world stage for his patriotism and his resilience. 
""He's proved to be an incredible leader, and one many world leaders could take notes from. He is serving the people of his country well.""
Melanie believes ""even though it is a comedy"" it doesn't ""take away from what he is doing now"". 
Although only three episodes were broadcast on Channel 4 on Sunday, Melanie has plans to watch the others - all 48 of them.
""I will definitely be watching it. As long as I can access it, I will be watching it.""

Racheal Diyaolu has been taking cover in her university's bunker since the Russian invasion
An Irish medical student is attempting to leave Ukraine after sheltering for days from airstrikes and shelling in the eastern town of Sumy.
Racheal Diyaolu, who is 19 and from Carlow, was among hundreds of international students in the city close to Ukraine's border with Russia.
Sumy has been under attack by Russia since its invasion started last month.
Racheal told BBC News NI she had been mentally ""blocking out"" the dangers she faced.
It is understood she left Sumy on Monday after she was picked up by two Scottish men attempting a rescue who her family had been in contact with.
Her sister, Christiana, said she had passed safely through a number of checkpoints and was staying overnight at a ""safe stopover location"" before a curfew begins.
""The relief just knowing that they're safe and sheltered,"" she told BBC Radio Ulster's Evening Extra programme.
""We're hoping for the best now.""
A previous rescue effort failed on Sunday when a minivan used by the men was targeted by ""warning shots"" from Russian forces as they tried to enter Sumy, Racheal said.
However, they managed to reach an agreed pick-up location on Monday morning.
Change of plans
On Monday night, Racheal said that the group planned to head for Moldova on Tuesday.
""Hopefully we'll be able to get to the border and find our way through, and get home soon,"" she said in a video, posted on Twitter.

Earlier, she had told RTÉ's Morning Ireland programme they hoped to travel in the direction of Poland, a journey which could take up to 20 hours.
She was not sure if they could make use of humanitarian corridors. 
""I have left behind lots of friends who are still stuck there and still looking for ways to get out, and most of my belongings as well,"" she explained.
""I'm fine, just trying to stay in high spirits and keep positive that we'll make it to Poland.""
Christiana said the Scottish men had their phones seized during the attack on Sunday before being told to turn back.
""Luckily they were able to find an alternative route into Sumy and stayed there overnight and then continued their mission this morning,"" she added.
Racheal has been studying in Ukraine since November
The Irish Department of Foreign Affairs told BBC News NI it was aware of 52 Irish citizens remaining in Ukraine.
On Sunday, UN monitors said 364 civilian deaths had been confirmed in Ukraine since the invasion began on 24 February, but the real figure was likely to be ""considerably higher"".
Ms Diyaolu arrived in the country from the Republic of Ireland for her studies last November.
Since the invasion started, she has been taking cover in her university's bunker when air raid sirens have sounded.
""Someone will come and knock on your door on all the floors to let them know that it's time to go down and take cover, bring your essentials and your documents,"" she told BBC News NI before her latest attempt to leave Sumy.
The Ukrainian deputy prime minister has said Russia is striking civilian targets in Ukraine, including hospitals, nurseries, and schools.

IN DEPTH: Full coverage of the conflict
At the beginning of the invasion, Russian tanks and troops poured into Ukraine at points along its borders including northern regions such as Sumy. 
Ms Diyaolu said it had been ""an out-of-body experience"" to know there is such danger outside.
""I've had to train my mind to block out the fact that this is incoming danger,"" she told BBC News NI.
""It does happen so frequently at this point that you kind of don't have time to be afraid any more.""
Russian forces have been heavily shelling towns outside the capital of Kyiv
The student said things had become quite difficult in Sumy, ""especially for people who are trying to get out"".
""It's been quite hard going, we've had a lot of air strike threats, we've had quite a few bombs being dropped,"" she said.
'I haven't lost hope'
The medical student said she had tried to ""hold on to hope"" that she would be able to get home.
""It's especially hard on my mother, she's just worried to death all day every day, trying to get in contact with me,"" she said.
""The best thing I can do is stay calm when I am talking to her, letting her know that I'm OK.
""I know that I'm in a scary situation and in a dangerous area, but letting her know that I'm OK, mentally and physically, and that my mind is with them at home and my mind is focused on staying safe and trying to find ways to get out.""
Ms Diyaolu's family have been calling for more help from the Irish government to bring the 19-year-old home.
Ireland's Department of Foreign Affairs said it could not comment on specific cases, but confirmed it was in contact with Irish citizens in Ukraine.
It has advised people to ""shelter in a secure place"" or, if it is safe to do so, to ""consider leaving Ukraine, depending on their location and prevailing circumstances"".

In a separate interview with 5 Live Breakfast's Rick Edwards and Rachel Burden, Red Bull's Christian Horner speaks about the FIA decision to remove Michael Masi as F1 race director
Red Bull team principal Christian Horner has accused rivals Mercedes of ""bullying"" behaviour resulting in the exit of race director Michael Masi.
Horner has questioned the FIA's removal of Masi in the wake of the controversy over last year's title decider.
""Was it right to fire him based on pressure that was placed on him from a rival team? That for me was wrong,"" Horner said.
""That's tantamount to bullying. It's passively aggressive.""
Horner's remarks, made in an exclusive interview with BBC Sport, are a reference to Mercedes, whose driver Lewis Hamilton refused to commit to coming back to Formula 1 this season until he had seen the results of the FIA's inquiry into the race in Abu Dhabi. 
Mercedes have declined to comment.
Hamilton was beaten to the drivers' title by Red Bull's Max Verstappen after a safety-car period late in the season's final race in Abu Dhabi.
Masi has been offered a new role at the FIA - the sport's governing body - and replaced as race director by two people who will alternate in the job, with a new support structure put in place to lessen the pressure on the role.
In a wide-ranging interview, Horner also discussed:
His views on what happened in Abu Dhabi
His driver Verstappen's controversial driving tactics
Verstappen's new six-year contract with Red Bull
His decision to oppose an increase in the number of 'sprint' events
On Masi, Horner added: ""Yes, Michael did make mistakes and it was frustrating, but you have to look at the role that he was in and the tools that he had at his disposal. 
""You can't just place the blame on Michael. It's unfair to do that.""
Horner has drawn some criticism from within F1 for talking about the need to be concerned for Masi's mental health, given the amount of blame he and Red Bull levelled at officials in the course of 2021.
But he said he had spoken out because he felt it was unacceptable the way Masi had been treated, both by fans threatening him on social media, and by the FIA, which Horner believes did not give its race director enough support.
""We were on the receiving end of many of Michael's errors,"" Horner said. ""But he is in a high-pressure role in a high-pressure sport.
""But what it is unforgivable is the trolling, the abuse online, the death threats that he and his family had. That absolutely cannot be condoned in any way.
""That has nothing to do with the sport. It's just out-and-out bullying and I would not accept that in any way within our organisation. 
""That's why I spoke up for Michael because I felt that he had not had any support. He had not had any backing. That he'd been hung out to dry and that there was this concerted campaign that was very passive-aggressively focused against him. 
""I will always stand up for someone who is being bullied. Bullying is not acceptable.""
On Abu Dhabi
Many senior figures within F1 accept that Masi failed to administer the rules correctly in Abu Dhabi in two different ways during a late safety-car period - in only letting some, rather than all, of the lapped cars out of the way of the leaders, and in the timing of the restart.
Hamilton had dominated the race and was on course to win an eighth world title. But the sequence of events at the end left him a sitting duck on old tyres, and on the single racing lap after the restart, Verstappen passed the Mercedes to win his first world title. 
The FIA has effectively acknowledged mistakes were made, in both the decisions it has taken, and in remarks by executive director of single-seaters Peter Bayer on the race.
But Horner said: ""I don't believe the rules were not followed correctly. I think that they were applied perhaps differently to how they had been before by not allowing every single car to unlap.""
He added that ""if [the stewards] felt the rules were not applied correctly, they wouldn't have declared the result"" following Mercedes' post-race appeal.
On Red Bull's behaviour in Abu Dhabi
Max Verstappen won the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix to clinch the F1 title
Red Bull have been criticised for the way they pressured Masi in Abu Dhabi. 
As Masi deliberated on what to do, Horner told him: ""You only need one racing lap."" 
Red Bull sporting director Jonathan Wheatley also pressured Masi, who then echoed Wheatley's choice of words back to Mercedes F1 boss Toto Wolff when the Austrian complained about the way the race had been handled.
But Horner said he believed Red Bull had applied less pressure on Masi than Mercedes had in the race.
""You've got to report the facts,"" Horner said. ""Who was the first to call Michael? It wasn't me. I'm only responding to the pressure being applied on him that I can hear in my ear from a rival team. It's my job as the principal of the team that I represent to defend it.
""I think it was probably less than the pressure that our rivals were pushing on to not have a safety car. Or to back-track a lap. Or not to have a virtual safety car, or for the virtual safety car to go into a full safety car.""
And he said Masi's decision to let only some lapped cars through had made no difference to the result.
""Looking at that incident, it wasn't a big crash and the driver was not injured,"" Horner said. ""The car was near an exit [in the barriers] and it always looked the likelihood that would be cleared up, and there would have been no problem releasing all seven cars rather than just five. 
""If they'd have released all seven them, would you have had a problem with it?
""It would make no difference to the outcome of the championship if they'd got all seven out of the way. The only mistake you could argue he made was not releasing the back two cars, that he could've done easily, but it had no material effect on the race.""
On not ending races behind safety car
Horner is one of several figures in F1 to admit that Masi was trying to follow guidance directing him to do his best to avoid races ending under a safety-car period.
In concert with the success of the fly-on-the-wall Netflix documentary series Drive To Survive, this has led to accusations that the sport has allowed entertainment to take priority over sporting integrity.
Horner said: ""It would have been the worst possible finish to what had been a magnificent season. When you look at the intensity of it, for it to end under a safety car after a lame accident would have been shocking.""
When it was pointed out to him that the FIA had said the image of F1 had been ""tarnished"" by the controversy, Horner said: ""Yeah, but the production director of Netflix was not sitting next to Michael Masi when he was making that decision.""
And asked whether the sport had allowed itself to lose sight of its priorities, Horner said: ""F1 is still a sport, but sport is an entertainment. And one could also argue that there have been more people talking about Formula 1 in the past two and a half months when, traditionally, it would have been in hibernation. 
""The viewing figures have never been bigger. Every promoter is sold out. Silverstone are trying to accommodate more seats and grandstand places. There's never been more competition to host a Grand Prix. So, um, is it all that bad?""
On Verstappen's aggressive driving

Verstappen drove an outstanding season in 2021, and it is widely acknowledged that he and Hamilton staged one of the all-time great title battles.
But the Dutchman's aggressive racing tactics have drawn criticism, particularly his tendency to force rivals off the track in wheel-to-wheel battles.
Has Horner ever sat Verstappen down and advised him that he should consider driving less aggressively?
""We talk about any incident,"" Horner said, ""but it's always going to be between me and him. 
""Max is a forceful driver. He's an aggressive driver. And that driving style is why he was voted the most popular driver in Formula 1 [in a survey of motorsport fans, external conducted by the sport]. You just know he is going to give 110%.""
Does Horner want him to carry on the way he is driving?
""Absolutely.""
In all the moves in question? 
""Well, no, you're always going to learn, aren't you? And I think the way he drove last year, he showed tremendous maturity - and let's not forget the others make mistakes. 
""There are other drivers that make aggressive actions as well, you know. But, yeah, Max is an aggressive driver. That's his DNA; that's who he is. Yes, he will always be close to the limit and he will only learn from his experiences. I've got no doubt about that.""
On Verstappen's new contract
Verstappen last week signed a contract extension with Red Bull that commits him to the team until 2028.
Horner said negotiations were ""straightforward"" and that the deal ""shows real intent from both sides"".
Verstappen's decision shows great faith in Red Bull in the context of the withdrawal of their engine partner Honda at the end of last season; with no insight into how the power units will compare this year, following the beginning of an engine development freeze; and with a new engine formula due for 2026.
Horner said: ""It shows the confidence he has in us. Seeing the commitment and the investment of the group and the activities going within the group, I think that it made an awful lot of sense. There's pressure on us to deliver. But that's normal in this business.""
On Red Bull blocking sprint races
Last year, F1 staged three 'sprint' events, which used a short race on Saturday in place of qualifying to set the grid for the main grand prix.
The sport had wanted to double the number this year, and presented data to the teams that showed the sprints increased audiences and revenue.
But Red Bull were one of the big teams who blocked moves to increase the number of sprints. 
Arguing that the budget cap was being reduced by $5m this year, and that more races meant more costs, they demanded more money than a simple pro-rata increase of the compensation payments that were made last year.
In the end, a compromise was reached to hold only three sprint events.
""Financially it makes zero sense to agree to any sprint races,"" Horner said, ""but in the interests of the sport, we conceded to agree to three. We're not even being permitted the increase of inflation. 
""When you're seeing gas and electricity bills, the amount of inflation that is going on at the moment... when the budget cap was set, it was set at a limit in the midst of the coronavirus crisis that in many respects is irrelevant to what's going on in the modern world. So that is why it was limited to three races.""

126,126,Man Utd players want manager clarity amid uncertainty,"Mon, 07 Mar 2022 19:56:22 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/60651899,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/60651899?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,Manchester United's players are becoming increasingly concerned at the managerial void at Old Trafford as their season continues to unravel.,"Manchester United: Players increasingly concerned by managerial uncertainty
Manchester United are one point behind fourth-placed Arsenal, having played three games more
Manchester United's players are becoming increasingly concerned at the managerial void at Old Trafford as their season continues to unravel.
United's 4-1 loss at Manchester City on Sunday was only their second defeat under interim boss Ralf Rangnick.
However, they have won just eight of the German's 18 games in charge, including none of the last three.
Meanwhile, BBC Sport also understands England striker Marcus Rashford is unsure of his Old Trafford future.
Manchester United players 'not good enough or don't care' 
Manchester City outclass Manchester United in derby
'Phil Foden sets the tempo' - how City 'steamrollered' United
Rashford still wants to play for United and has another full season left on his contract - plus the option to extend until 2024.
But the 24-year-old, who started yesterday's game on the bench despite the absences of Cristiano Ronaldo and Edinson Cavani, feels his career has stalled and is concerned his international prospects will be damaged if the situation fails to improve.
In addition, it is hard to see Ronaldo, 37, wanting to stay for a second season if United fail to qualify for the Champions League.
Rangnick admitted to United's own media channels that his side 'can almost not drop any more points' over their final 10 games if they are to secure a top-four berth.
Considering their run-in includes trips to Liverpool and Arsenal, plus home games against Tottenham on Saturday and then Chelsea on 15 May, getting maximum points will not be easy. 
United know a failure to secure a place in next season's Champions League will hamper their chances of trying to sign new players - or persuade others to stay, such as France midfielder Paul Pogba, who is out of contract in the summer.
While United's players understand much of the responsibility for the current predicament lies with them, there is also a belief they are not being helped by the extended period without a permanent manager and lack of clarity over who will eventually succeed Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, who was sacked on 21 November.
Paris St-Germain boss Mauricio Pochettino and Ajax's Erik ten Hag remain the frontrunners for the post. Last week, United's football director John Murtough said a 'thorough process' was underway and it is understood that is advancing.
However, both men have contracts until 2023 and crucial Champions League last 16 second-leg ties looming, so direct communication at this stage would seem unlikely.
The situation is adding to a general air of uncertainty around Old Trafford, with numerous players becoming disenchanted with life at the club.
Jesse Lingard, Juan Mata and Cavani are almost certain to leave when their contracts expire in the summer. There is uncertainty too over the futures of goalkeeper Dean Henderson, defender Eric Bailly, plus Anthony Martial and Donny van de Beek, who are currently on loan at Sevilla and Everton.
Speaking after the defeat by Premier League leaders Manchester City, midfielder Scott McTominay said accusations by former players Roy Keane and Gary Neville that United gave up at the Etihad were ""incredibly disappointing"".
""I have nothing to say about problems [at the club],"" McTominay told Sky Sports. ""It's not my place to say anything. We have a big end to the season coming up and we need to get in the Champions League. That's all I'm thinking about.
""Whatever goes on behind the scenes is completely irrelevant to me. Obviously I'm part of it, but you have to concentrate on your own game. You can get too distracted by all the things that are going on at the football club.
""We have to stick together. We can't let something like this be so damaging to us that we lack confidence going into the next game.""
'Pathetic' Man Utd in 'total mess' - Sutton
Speaking on BBC Radio 5 Live's Monday Night Club, former Premier League striker Chris Sutton said Manchester United are in a ""total mess"" and the squad requires ""a massive overhaul"" in the summer transfer window.
""I don't know what the identity is any more. People speak about the past and the glory years - but those glory years haven't been there for a long time now,"" Sutton said.
""You have to question whether a lot of the players want to be at Manchester United any more. The dressing room is a cesspit. It's full of big egos and they're getting found out in a big, big way now.""
Sutton suggested that United needed to move out star names such as Cristiano Ronaldo, Edinson Cavani and Paul Pogba.
He said: ""Ronaldo needs to go, without a doubt. Cavani, Pogba [also need to go]. Manchester United need to rip things up and start again.""
Former Manchester City defender Micah Richards said: ""Everyone in that squad is looking after themselves.
""I wouldn't trust being in that squad, it's pathetic. Where is the team spirit? Everything is getting out, I wouldn't want to be in that dressing room.""

Hearings have begun in the public inquiry, external scrutinising the UK's response to, and impacts of, the coronavirus pandemic.
As the virus spread, government agencies increasingly published figures on case numbers, hospitalisations and deaths.
To follow alongside the inquiry, the BBC's data team has broken down some of these statistics into key areas from the beginning of the pandemic up to 5 May 2023, when the World Health Organisation declared an end to the virus as a ""global health emergency"", external.
How many people died?
Just under 227,000 people died in the UK with Covid-19 listed as one of the causes on their death certificate. This includes those who had not been tested for the virus prior to their death.
The most deaths reported in this way on a single day was on 19 January 2021, when 1,490 people were registered.
At this point in the pandemic, the first variant of the virus seen in the UK - initially detected in Kent - was dominant. This was subsequently named the 'Alpha' variant by the WHO.
The UK was also only a month into the first stages of its vaccine rollout, which started to reduce the risk of death and serious illness from the virus.
Another way of looking at the impact coronavirus had on the number of people dying in the UK is by counting all deaths over and above the expected number since the pandemic began, sometimes referred to ""excess deaths"", external. 
As of 5 May 2023, this was over 208,000 deaths. For most of the previous three years there were above average levels of deaths in the UK.

What to do if you have Covid: Can you go to work or school?
The highest peaks in the first two years of the pandemic were during periods when many people died directly from Covid. Out of nearly 13,000 excess deaths in mid-April 2020, about 9,500 were attributed to the virus.
But a larger portion of the excess seen in the second half of 2022 were driven by other factors, including flu and pressure on the NHS. Of the 3,300 excess deaths in mid-January 2023, about 600 were from Covid.
Compared with other countries, over the three years to February 2023, the UK's death rates went up by more than 5%, which was more than France, Germany and Spain (all up between 3% and 4.5%), but by less than Italy's (up more than 6%).
The US and Eastern European countries like Poland were even harder hit, with death rates more than 10% above their pre-pandemic levels over the three years to February 2023.
How many people caught the virus?
More than 44 million people in the UK, external were estimated to have had the virus between April 2020 and February 2022, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). This is the most accurate measure available as the total number of infections across the country will never be known.
The ONS ran a regular survey through the pandemic: testing randomly chosen people in order to estimate the number of people who had the virus.
Based on the survey, the estimated peak of the pandemic, in cases if not in deaths, was in late March 2022, where at one point about 4.9 million people were thought to have the virus. However, the survey did not capture the first wave of the pandemic, with trials only beginning in England in April 2020.
Figures are still regularly published on the number of recorded coronavirus cases across the UK, from PCR and lateral flow tests. However, recorded cases are not considered to present the most accurate picture for a variety of reasons, including the availability and reach of testing.
How many people were in hospital?
Patients were admitted to hospital with coronavirus more than 1.1 million times between March 2020 and 5 May 2023 across England, Scotland and Northern Ireland.
These were people who tested positive up to two weeks before arriving at hospital, or while being treated. 
In Wales the figures were counted differently, with about 43,000 admissions of those who either had, or were suspected to have, the virus.
The number of patients in hospital with coronavirus peaked in the week to 20 January 2021, at more than 38,000 people.
When a new national lockdown was announced on 5 January 2021, across hospitals in England about one in four general admission beds were occupied by patients with coronavirus.
This period was the first time the health service had to cope with both normal winter pressures, and the additional strain from Covid, which was spreading among an unvaccinated population with little immunity.
How many people got vaccinated?
The rollout of coronavirus vaccines began in the UK on 9 December 2020, when the world's first Pfizer dose was administered to 90-year-old Margaret Keenan in Coventry.
Since then, nearly 176 million Covid vaccines have been administered in various stages up to May 2023. Starting with older and clinically vulnerable people and moving down the age groups into young adults and some children.
Eligible groups were offered two main doses as a minimum, plus a booster dose, with additional boosters for more vulnerable groups later on in the pandemic.
About 88% of people in the UK over the age of 12 (58 million) are thought to have had both a first and second dose of a vaccine, with 93% receiving a single jab.
This is based on the ONS mid-year population estimates for 2021, and vaccine data from up to 7 May in Scotland and 5 May for the other UK nations.
There is some uncertainty, especially in the proportion of people who did not receive a jab. The choice of population estimate makes a significant difference to the proportion of people thought to be vaccinated.
A small number of people (fewer than one million as of September 2022) aged 5-11 had received a first and second dose of a coronavirus jab. In addition, vaccinated people are removed from the figures after they have died, which could inflate the number considered unvaccinated.

129,129,War in Ukraine: Russia says it may cut gas supplies if oil ban goes ahead,"Tue, 08 Mar 2022 06:26:55 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-60656673,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-60656673?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,A top official says Russia may close its gas lines to Germany if the West halts oil imports.,"War in Ukraine: Russia says it may cut gas supplies if oil ban goes ahead
The Nord Stream 1 gas pipeline was inaugurated just over a decade ago
Russia has said it may close its main gas pipeline to Germany if the West goes ahead with a ban on Russian oil.
Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak said a ""rejection of Russian oil would lead to catastrophic consequences for the global market"", causing prices to more than double to $300 a barrel.
The US has been exploring a potential ban with allies as a way of punishing Russia for its invasion of Ukraine.
But Germany and the Netherlands rejected the plan on Monday.
The EU gets about 40% of its gas and 30% of its oil from Russia, and has no easy substitutes if supplies are disrupted.
While the UK would not be directly impacted by supply disruption, as it imports less than 5% of its gas from Russia, it would be affected by prices rising in the global markets as demand in Europe increases.
Iain Conn, the former boss of British Gas owner Centrica, said natural gas was ""less freely"" traded compared to oil, and it would be ""much more difficult"" to replace Russian gas if supplies are affected as it is transported through fixed pipelines from country to country.
The price of Brent crude - the global benchmark for oil prices - rose to around $130 a barrel on Tuesday following reports that the US and UK will announce its own ban on Russian oil imports.
In an address on Russian state television, Mr Novak said it would be ""impossible to quickly find a replacement for Russian oil on the European market"".
""It will take years, and it will still be much more expensive for European consumers. Ultimately, they will be hurt the worst by this outcome,"" he said.
Pointing to Germany's decision last month to freeze certification of Nord Stream 2, a new gas pipeline connecting the two countries, he added that an oil embargo could prompt retaliation.
""We have every right to take a matching decision and impose an embargo on gas pumping through the [existing] Nord Stream 1 gas pipeline,"" he said.
Could the world survive without Russian oil?
Could EU weaponise energy in Russia crisis?
Petrol at fresh record as oil and gas prices soar
Russia is the world's second largest gas producer and third largest oil exporter, and any move to impose sanctions on its energy industry would badly damage its own economy.
Nathan Piper, head of oil and gas research at Investec, said although imposing sanctions on Russia's oil and gas exports was attractive, ""practically it is challenging"".
He said both the global oil and gas markets were tight ahead of the war in Ukraine ""with limited spare capacity to replace any disrupted Russian volumes"".
""The question is now whether US and European leaders are prepared to endure high oil and gas prices to add energy exports to the sanctions list,"" he told the BBC.
""The threat of this action is almost the worst of both worlds, forcing prices up but doing nothing to limit Russian volumes or the revenues flowing to Moscow.""
Analysts at Capital Economics have forecast oil prices could rise to $160 a barrel if the West imposed sanctions on Russian exports, but David Oxley, senior global economist at the consultancy, told the BBC it was disruption to Russian gas that would hit countries harder, describing it as a ""completely different kettle of fish"".
He said energy intensive industries across Europe could be hit, with ""vast swathes of heavy industry being switched off"" as it is much harder finding replacement gas suppliers compared with oil.
EU countries heavily reliant on Russian gas, such as Germany, could switch from gas to coal, he said, but that would run counter to the bloc's climate ambitions and would not be a long-term solution.
The energy markets have been supremely volatile over the past week, and understandably so. There are genuine fears that supplies of oil and gas from Russia could be cut off or disrupted. 
Yet the response to Russia's suggestion it could close a major pipeline, depriving northern Europe of a large chunk of its gas supplies, has been pretty muted so far. 
There are a couple of reasons for this. Firstly, Russia is threatening a tit-for-tat embargo - cutting off its gas exports if the West goes ahead with a ban on Russian oil. 
But despite pressure from the US, such a ban is unlikely. European leaders have already poured cold water on the idea - so Russia's counter-threat carries relatively little weight. 
And then there's the fact that Russia is still making huge sums from sales of oil and gas to Europe every day, helping to fund its war.  
Moscow has everything to gain from exploiting traders' nerves to push up energy prices; but a great deal to lose if it were to carry out its threat.
Ukraine has implored the West to adopt an oil and gas ban, but there are concerns it would send prices soaring. Investor fears of an embargo drove Brent crude oil to $139 (£106) a barrel at one point on Monday - its highest level for almost 14 years.
Meanwhile, wholesale gas prices rose to 565p per therm early on Tuesday, but fell to 480p in the afternoon.
UK stock markets rose slightly in early trading after a volatile Monday caused by the US's discussions over a potential Russian oil and gas ban.
Early on Tuesday, nickel prices on the London Metal Exchange more than doubled to rise above the $100,000-a-tonne level for the first time, before trading in the metal was suspended.
Russia supplies the world with about 10% of its nickel needs, mainly for use in stainless steel and electric vehicle batteries.
Average UK petrol prices have hit a record 155p a litre
Quoting unnamed sources, Reuters news agency reported that the US might be willing to move ahead with an embargo without its allies, although it only gets about 3% of its oil from Russia.
However, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has dismissed the idea of a wider ban, saying Europe had ""deliberately exempted"" Russian energy from sanctions because its supply could not be secured ""any other way"" at the moment.
European powers have, however, committed to move away from Russian hydrocarbons over time, while some Western companies have boycotted Russian shipments or pledged to sell their stakes in Russian energy companies.
Mr Novak said that Russian companies were already feeling the pressure of US and European moves to lower the dependence on Russian energy, despite fulfilling all its contractual obligations to deliver oil and gas to Europe.
""We are concerned by the discussion and statements we are seeing regarding a possible embargo on Russian oil and petrochemicals, on phasing them out,"" he said.

Watch: Ben Wallace says visa process for refugees coming from Ukraine could be quicker
The UK needs to speed up the processing of visas for refugees fleeing the war in Ukraine, the defence secretary has said.
Ben Wallace told the BBC the government could and would do more to support refugees, and his department would help the Home Office accelerate the system.
The UK has granted visas to 300 Ukrainian refugees under its new scheme so far, the Home Office said.
It added that 17,700 applications to re-join relatives had been started.
But about 600 refugees are stuck in Calais, with many saying they were turned away for lack of paperwork.
Almost 300 people have been turned away while trying to cross to the UK, French officials told the BBC. 
Downing Street said a new visa processing site would be established in the northern French city of Lille ""in the coming days"".
When asked why it was not being set up in Calais, where Ukrainian refugees are stuck, a No 10 spokesman said the government wanted to ensure it can give the ""appropriate level of support"" refugees require.
Up until now people in Calais have been told to go to Paris to apply for their visa, with some Ukrainians telling the BBC they faced a wait of more than a week just for an appointment in the French capital.

Diane Abbott says a lack of help in Calais for Ukrainian refugees brings the UK into disrepute
The UN says that more than two million people have now fled the war in Ukraine, external - most of them to Poland.
Unlike the European Union - which is allowing Ukrainians three-year residency without a visa - the UK has retained controls on entry, with Prime Minister Boris Johnson saying it was ""sensible"" to ""have some basic ability to check who is coming in and who isn't"".
There are two main routes to a visa for refugees from the war, requiring them either to have family in the UK, or a British sponsor for their application.
After criticism from France that the UK's approach showed a ""lack of humanity"", Ms Patel said she had ""surged a Home Office team"" to help at Calais - and denied anyone had been turned back at the border.
But the BBC found a Home Office presence at a local administrative building disappeared on Monday morning, while a sign at the hostel where many refugees were staying directed them to Brussels or Paris for visa applications.
Is the UK doing enough to help refugees?
How many refugees have fled and where are they going?
Calais' sub-prefect Véronique Deprez-Boudier said that 286 Ukrainian refugees have been turned away by UK authorities so far. 
She told the BBC it is ""important to build a more organised team"" in Calais to assist them to get visas, rather than make them travel elsewhere to secure one.
The Home Office said staff have been ""surged"" at appointment centres across Europe - including in Poland, Romania, Hungary, Moldova and the Czech Republic - as well as in the UK in order to process applications as quickly as possible, while maintaining ""essential security checks"".
A spokesperson said the UK stands ""shoulder-to-shoulder"" with the Ukrainian people and it was ""working at pace to process applications as quickly as possible"".
Ukraine has begun evacuating civilians from the town of Irpin, near the capital Kyiv, and the northern city of Sumy after Russian and Ukrainian officials agreed to set up humanitarian corridors.
But on Tuesday, Ukrainian officials said Russian forces were shelling an evacuation route out of the besieged southern city of Mariupol.
Ukrainian cities have continued to suffer heavy bombardment from Russian forces, causing several civilian evacuation plans to collapse.

Speaking to BBC Breakfast, the defence secretary said the UK's visa scheme for Ukrainian refugees was ""generous"" but conceded ""we can... and will do more"".
Insisting the ""vast"" scheme would allow hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians to enter the UK, he said: ""It's not the case that we are only allowing 300 people in... the system has not been quick enough, which is what we're going to address.""
Challenged on the 600 Ukrainians stuck in Calais and whether visas should be processed there, Mr Wallace insisted he was ""not the home secretary"" and the detail on how to process the visas was a matter for Ms Patel's department.
He said she was ""determined"" to speed up the process and - revealing his department has offered to help - added: ""we'll all lean in to help the Home Office deliver that"".
Mr Wallace also said the UK will increase its ""lethal and non-lethal aid"" to Ukraine and he will set out further details in a statement MPs on Wednesday.
Meanwhile, Justice Secretary Dominic Raab will travel to the Hague to help an international effort to gather evidence on Russian war crimes in Ukraine, the foreign secretary told MPs on Tuesday.
'No-one can help us here'
By Mark Easton, BBC home editor in Calais
The Raminishvili family are stuck in Calais
Misha Raminishvili was close to despair, his daughter in tears, as the news came through. 
""No visa for at least another week,"" he said, simply. ""No-one can help us in Calais.""
I met Misha, with his Ukrainian wife Maria and two children, at a hostel in the French port which is accommodating 137 Ukrainian refugees.
Misha has a house in Hornchurch, east London, but lives between there and Kyiv.
He and his son, Misha Jr, have UK passports. But his wife Maria, and daughter Gabrielle, do not - and therefore need visas to enter the UK, which require biometric checks.
Misha has been stuck in Calais for five days, unable to get his family across the Channel, in what would be the last leg of a journey that began on 24 February.

The Home Office repeated its claim that it was the first visa scheme to launch since the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
Since the Ukraine Family Scheme launched on 4 March, 8,900 applications have been submitted, while 4,300 applicants have made appointments to submit their biometric details.
Of these, 640 applications have been confirmed, the Home Office said, and 300 visas have been issued so far.
Refugee and migrant rights director Steve Valdez-Symonds said the Home Office was ""once again too slow and too bureaucratic in response to a refugee crisis that almost everyone saw coming"".
Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the government should be offering a ""simple route to sanctuary"" for people in danger, and said the Home Office is ""in a complete mess"".

War in Ukraine will push up energy prices and see UK families squeezed even further, a think tank has warned.
The Resolution Foundation forecasts that a typical household's income will fall by about £1,000 this year once the effect of inflation is accounted for.
That would be the biggest real-terms fall in incomes since the mid-1970s, it added. 
A government spokesperson said it recognised the pressures households are facing.
Many families were already expecting their monthly spend to go up when the energy price cap jumps in April, and National Insurance contributions rise. 
But in a new report, external, the Resolution Foundation said the Ukraine conflict would push up living costs even further as the prices of fuel and other goods surged. 
It expects inflation, which measures how the cost of living changes over time, to peak in April at 8.3%. That is much higher the Bank of England's forecast of 7.25% back in February.
Five ways the Ukraine war could push up prices
Charities warn fuel poverty could double in a year
Petrol at fresh record as oil and gas prices soar
""The crisis in Ukraine has increased both the scale of price rises but also the degree of uncertainty about their levels and duration,"" the Foundation's report said. 
""The UK's post-Covid economic recovery is well under way, but a deep living standards downturn is just getting going,"" it added, also warning that wages are not forecast to grow particularly fast either.
This spring was always going to be a crunch moment. 
At the start of April, spikes in global oil and gas prices from last year start to feed through to our energy bills and the energy price cap jumps up. You should have had a message from your provider by now explaining what's happening to your particular bill and warning about an increase to your direct debit.
That will be hard enough for many households, but we're also now seeing record prices at petrol stations due to the war in Ukraine. The Resolution Foundation is also warning the conflict will bring more price rises, with inflation peaking at the same point as the price cap goes up. 
The only saving grace is the time of year. At least if the weather improves (and that's a big ""if""), we can start using less energy and leaving the car at home becomes easier for many. That could help people to divert cash to cover the rising prices in shops, which we will have to pay whatever the season. 
Its principal economist, Adam Cortlett, said soaring bills would hit low and middle-income families the hardest.
He also suggested poorer households would face a ""living standards rollercoaster"" because of the way that benefit payments are set months in advance.
For example, most working age benefits and the state pension are due to rise by 3.1% in April - a time when the increase in the cost of living could be as high as 8%. But high inflation in 2022 should lead to bigger payments next year.
The think tank called on Chancellor Rishi Sunak to announce fresh support for struggling families at his Spring Statement.
Torsten Bell, chief executive of the Resolution Foundation, said: ""While the economic fallout from the war will feel trivial compared to the suffering experienced by millions of Ukrainians, it will still have a significant impact in Britain.""
He suggested that surging gas and oil prices would worsen the ""cost of living crisis"", causing a ""painful squeeze on family incomes"".
Mr Bell told the BBC's Today programme the country was heading into a ""living standards recession"".
""We could see income falls of 4% in the financial year that's about to kick off, we never see that outside of significant recessions,"" he said.
""Given it will take us quite a few years to claw our way back from that, it may well feel like our living standards during the pandemic were as good as it got during the first half of the 2020s.""
A government spokesperson said: ""We recognise the pressures people are facing with the cost of living, which is why we're providing support worth around £20bn this financial year and next to help.""
They said this includes freezing fuel duties to keep costs down, as well as launching energy bills rebate programme. 
""We have also boosted the minimum wage by more than £1,000 a year for full-time workers and our £500m Household Support Fund is helping the most vulnerable with essential costs,"" they added.

133,133,Government rescue of Bulb Energy set to cost taxpayers billions more,"Tue, 08 Mar 2022 00:12:16 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-60653751,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-60653751?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,"A buyer hasn't been found for the ailing supplier, so the the taxpayer will have to keep funding it.","Government rescue of Bulb Energy set to cost taxpayers billions more
Keeping Bulb Energy running will potentially cost taxpayers billions of pounds more than has currently been set aside, government officials have said. 
Bulb, which has 1.6 million customers, was quasi-nationalised in late November when it was put into special administration as it buckled under rising wholesale gas prices.  
In November, wholesale prices were around £2 per unit. 
Since then, prices have been consistently higher than that. 
They hit peaks of £4.70 in December and as high as £8 on Monday - 20 times the prices seen last year - during extreme volatility.  
At the time Bulb was placed in special administration, the Treasury set aside £1.7bn to purchase the gas required until the end of the tax year in April 2022 by which time it was hoped a buyer would be found for the business.  
Government officials have conceded that the prospect of offloading the business to a private buyer seems remote in this environment and that means that taxpayers will be on the hook for a gas bill that energy analysts believe could run to billions of pounds.  
What can I do if my energy supplier goes bust?
Energy firm Bulb set to go into administration
A spokesperson for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said: ""The Special Administrator of Bulb is obligated to keep costs of the administration process as low as possible, and we continue to engage closely with them throughout to ensure maximum value for money for taxpayers."" 
The extreme volatility in energy markets has seen some customers prepared to pay £3,500 a year to fix their energy bills for two years, according to another large energy operator. 
That is well above the energy price cap of £1,971 that comes into effect in April but that cap is subject to potential further increases every six months. 
Industry analysts estimate the next energy price cap could be set at £3,000 or more from October.  
Other energy retailers are reluctant to offer or recommend customers lock in at such high prices as they fear they could be trapped on high tariffs if and when prices return to more normal levels. 
Some may be prepared to pay a high price for the peace of mind conferred by knowing what their outgoings will be. Millions of customers will simply be unable to afford energy bills later this year - despite the government's two-stage £9bn energy bill support package. 
This will offer consumers a £150 council tax rebate in April and a £200 loan in October to be repaid at £40 a year for the next five years.

The Amazon contains between 90 and 140 billion metric tons of carbon
The Amazon rainforest is moving towards a ""tipping point"" where trees may die off en masse, say researchers.
A study suggests the world's largest rainforest is losing its ability to bounce back from damage caused by droughts, fires and deforestation.
Large swathes could become sparsely forested savannah, which is much less efficient than tropical forest at sucking carbon dioxide from the air.
The giant forest traps carbon that would otherwise add to global warming.  
But previous studies have shown that parts of the Amazon are now emitting more carbon dioxide than can be absorbed.
""The trees are losing health and could be approaching a tipping point - basically, a mass loss of trees,"" said Dr Chris Boulton of the University of Exeter.
Record high deforestation of Amazon in January
Which countries are still cutting down trees?
World leaders promise to end deforestation by 2030
The findings, based on three decades of satellite data, show alarming trends in the ""health"" of the Amazon rainforest.
There are signs of a loss of resilience in more than 75% of the forest, with trees taking longer to recover from the effects of droughts largely driven by climate change as well as human impacts such as deforestation and fires.
A vicious cycle of damage could trigger ""dieback"", the scientists said. 
And while it's not clear when that critical point might be reached, the implications for climate change, biodiversity and the local community would be ""devastating"".
The more trees cut down, the less the forest can soak up emissions
Once the process begins they predict it could be a matter of decades before a ""significant chunk"" of the Amazon is transformed into savannah - a vastly different ecosystem made up of a mixture of grassland and trees.
""The Amazon stores lots of carbon and all of that would be released into the atmosphere, which would then further contribute to increasing temperatures and have future effects on global mean temperatures,"" Dr Boulton said, adding that stopping deforestation would go some way to addressing the problem.
Around a fifth of the rainforest has already been lost, compared to pre-industrial levels, they said.
The research was carried out by the University of Exeter, the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) and Technical University of Munich. 
""Deforestation and climate change are likely to be the main drivers of this decline,"" said Prof Niklas Boers of PIK and the Technical University of Munich.
Commenting, Dr Bonnie Waring of the Grantham Institute - Climate Change and Environment, Imperial College London, said: ""These latest findings are consistent with the accumulating evidence that the twin pressures of climate change and human exploitation of tropical forests are endangering the world's largest rainforest, which is home to one out of every 10 species known to science.""
The findings, based on satellite data from 1991 to 2016, are published in the journal Nature Climate Change, external.

135,135,War in Ukraine: Crisis is unleashing 'hell on earth' for food prices,"Tue, 08 Mar 2022 00:11:48 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-60653856,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-60653856?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,"The Ukraine war could push millions closer to starvation, the boss of the World Food Programme says.","War in Ukraine: Crisis is unleashing 'hell on earth' for food prices
Countries such as Yemen depend heavily on Russia and Ukraine for their wheat
The head of the World Food Programme, David Beasley, has warned the conflict in Ukraine could send global food prices soaring, with a catastrophic impact on the world's poorest.
Ukraine and Russia are both major exporters of basic foodstuffs, and the war has already hit crop production, driving up prices
Mr Beasley said it was putting more people at risk of starvation worldwide. 
""Just when you think hell on earth can't get any worse, it does,"" he said. 
Russia and Ukraine, once dubbed ""the breadbasket of Europe"", export about a quarter of the world's wheat and half of its sunflower products, like seeds and oil. Ukraine also sells a lot of corn globally.
Analysts have warned that war could impact the production of grains and even double global wheat prices.
Mr Beasley told BBC World Service's Business Daily programme that the number of people facing potential starvation worldwide had already risen from 80 million to 276 million in four years prior to Russia's invasion, due to what he calls a ""perfect storm"" of conflict, climate change and coronavirus.
He said certain countries could be particularly affected by the current crisis, due to the high proportion of grains they currently import from the Black Sea region.
David Beasley runs the World Food Programme
""The country of Lebanon, 50%, give or take, of their grains, come from Ukraine. Yemen, Syria, Tunisia - and I could go on and on - depend on the country of Ukraine as a breadbasket,"" he said. 
""So you're going from being a breadbasket to now, literally, having to hand out bread to them. It's just an incredible reverse of reality.""
'Defending our land' 
Norwegian chemical company Yara International, a major fertiliser producer which operates in more than 60 countries, told the BBC a shortage could badly hit crop yields, leading to ""a global food crisis"".
Ukrainian lawyer Ivanna Dorichenko, an expert in international trade arbitration, said some farmers in Ukraine have already abandoned their fields in order to take up arms against the Russian invasion.
She told the BBC: ""The men who need to work on the land, they're all defending our land right now. Because if they do not defend the land, there'll be nothing to work on at a later stage, and you don't have a single person right now who's not trying to help in any way they can.""
Ms Dorichenko said the war had wreaked havoc with supply lines typically used to export agricultural produce. Ukraine's military suspended all commercial shipping at its ports in the aftermath of the Russian invasion.
Ukraine war 'catastrophic for global food'
Fears of UK food and fuel prices rising due to war
""The vessels cannot leave the waters, the vessels cannot get loaded. It's effectively a war zone. Sadly, there's nothing which can be potentially shipped right now from Ukraine.""
She said it meant ""huge losses"" for businesses, but also humanitarian efforts, because Ukraine could no longer send goods to regions such as South East Asia, the Middle East and Africa, as well as to groups such the World Food Programme. 
With food price inflation already at crisis point in some countries prior to the outbreak of hostilities in Ukraine, South African economist Wandile Sihlobo said he was worried about the potential consequences for grain-importing nations in Africa and beyond.
Mr Sihlobo, chief economist at the Agricultural Business Chamber of South Africa, told the BBC that while steep price rises may be a problem in the short-term, shortages of essential crops could follow. 
""Over time, depending on the length and the severity of this war, you could begin to see shortages of shipments that come to the African continent, and that could cause shortages. Particularly in the North African countries, and to an extent in East Africa.""
He added: ""If you were to look at the global food price index, it was at multiple highs at the start of this year. This crisis already adds to that difficult environment for many consumers, particularly in the developing world.""
On Monday, one of the world's biggest fertiliser companies, Yara International, warned the conflict could hit its industry, further affecting food prices. 
Fertiliser prices had already been rising due to soaring wholesale gas prices. Russia also produces enormous amounts of nutrients, like potash and phosphate - key ingredients in fertilisers, which enable plants and crops to grow.

Women discuss their experiences of public sexual harassment
Women have been speaking about shocking incidents of sexual harassment - after a BBC poll found many often still feel unsafe walking alone at night.
The new poll suggests 43% of women in the UK have experienced unwelcome touching or groping in public.
The survey - conducted by YouGov, external - also indicates 28% of women have experienced indecent exposure in public.  
The chair of the Women and Equalities Committee said Boris Johnson must show he takes women's safety seriously.
It follows growing pressure to make public sexual harassment a crime.
Caroline Nokes, a Conservative MP who chairs the committee, told the BBC changing the law would send a ""really powerful message"" and could help tackle underlying causes of violent offences against women. 
""It will give women the confidence to report and sends a very clear message to perpetrators that this is criminal,"" she said.
How many violent attacks on women are there?
Sarah Everard: The people trying to make change
The survey found two thirds - 66% - of women said they did not feel safe walking alone at night, at least some of the time. That compared to just 39% of men who said they felt unsafe in the same situation.
The findings come a year after the murder of Sarah Everard, who was abducted and murdered while walking home in south London. 
Ms Everard's killer, police officer Wayne Couzens, was previously linked to allegations of indecent public exposure. Hers and other high-profile cases in the past year have led to increased awareness and campaigning around women's safety and public sexual harassment.
The BBC has also spoken to women across the UK about how sexual harassment impacts their lives.
One, a woman named Sarah, was on her way to a morning exercise class in Edinburgh last year when a man followed and groped her before running off laughing and filming her reaction.
""I was incredibly shocked. I remember I felt incredibly angry as well,"" she told the BBC. ""I also felt a real invasion of privacy, the fact he had filmed the whole incident.""
What happened to Sarah that day was the worst of a long history of experiences she and her friends remember going through over the years - from being groped in nightclubs as students to being shouted at by strangers in the street.
'Completely inappropriate'
""We used to be catcalled all the time as teenagers going out. It was something we laughed off and shrugged off,"" she said. ""But as a woman now, everyone has become a lot more aware of how dangerous those things are and how hostile it is.""
""There's an absolute entitlement to touch and to talk to you in a manner that is completely inappropriate,"" she added.
Sarah said the ""brazen"" assault by a stranger left her with a ""horrible feeling""
More than half of the women surveyed for the BBC said they avoided certain areas and being out at certain times to try to keep themselves safe from possible harassment and assault.
Roxanne, 26, no longer feels confident walking alone after experiencing everything from obscene comments to unwanted touching when out in public since she was a teenager. 
Roxanne believes a door has opened for women to ""normalise"" speaking out about their experiences
She now sticks to main roads when walking her dog and tries to only go out in daylight when she's by herself. 
Like 30% of women surveyed in the poll for the BBC, Roxanne says she wears flat shoes as a way to feel safer. She also carries a rape alarm, criminal identification spray and tries not to wear her hair in hairstyles such as ponytails she fears might be easier for an attacker to grab.
""I don't know who's going to harm me, when they're going to harm me - so I'm cautious of everybody,"" she said. ""And I think that's a natural and very common thing to feel with everything that's going on.""
The latest Crime Survey for England and Wales estimated 2.2% of the population aged between 16-59 were victims of sexual assault in the year ending March 2020 - a slight decrease on the year before.
'Women should be safe'
Public sexual harassment is not currently an offence in its own right. The term refers to unwanted sexual behaviour - from verbal comments to physical actions - which can leave victims feeling intimidated and degraded.  
The Law Commission - an independent body that advises the government on legal changes - recommended in December that ministers should consider creating a specific criminal offence for it during a review into hate crime laws.
Ms Nokes believes criminalising public sexual harassment could help intervene in escalating offender journeys to ensure ""today's flasher does not become tomorrow's rapist"". 
""I think the prime minister needs to step up and show that he does take women's safety seriously and that he's not interested in a few cosmetic measures like CCTV - but actually in legislative change with a cross-government approach,"" she said.
Caroline Nokes told the BBC the government should do more to help women feel safe
She believes current safety initiatives and advice place too much onus on women having to take precautions to try to protect themselves. 
""Of course we want women to be safe and we want them to be vigilant, but this is about men attacking them when they are just going about their daily lives,"" she said. ""Women should be safe wherever they are, whatever they're doing, however they're dressed.""
Ms Nokes also supports cultural and education reforms - including with mandatory consent classes in schools, colleges and universities. 
Nathaniel Horne works for a charity that runs workshops for boys and men aimed at tackling misogyny and encouraging healthier relationships.
Nathaniel Horne says ""all men can be better"" to help women feel more safe and change attitudes in society
""It's important to talk to people about this stuff early,"" he told the BBC about going into schools. ""Because I think once people are adults, and they've been out for a while, that can be entrenched in those views and those behaviours.""
The view is echoed by April-Joy Serrant, who last year was exposed to by a man performing a sex act in public while out on a run. As a mother of three sons, she says her experience has changed how she speaks with her children about relationships and content they may be exposed to. 
After posting a video about her experience online, she was overwhelmed by other women and girls getting in touch with their own experiences of the ""day in, day out"" harassment. 
""It had never crossed my mind until the incident that I experienced last year that my husband can go for a walk or for a run and it never crosses his mind,"" she said. ""And that is freedom."" 
The Home Office told the BBC that tacking violence against women and girls ""remains one of the top priorities of this government"". 
""We are committed to ensuring that existing laws on public sexual harassment are effective but we continue to look carefully at where there may be gaps and how a specific offence could address those,"" safeguarding minister Rachel Maclean said in a statement."" 
She said the government last week launched a new national communications campaign and said violence against women had now been made a priority for police forces, alongside national threats like terrorism.

A major study of vaccine side-effects in the US found no link between two Covid jabs and the number of deaths recorded after vaccination.
The Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said 92% of reported side-effects after the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines were mild.
About 4,500 people died after being vaccinated, in the US, up to June 2021.
But no unusual patterns in the data were detected that might suggest a link to the vaccine itself. 
Study author Dr Tom Shimabukuro said: ""[It's] reassuring that reactions to both mRNA vaccines are generally mild and subside after one or two days - confirming reports from clinical trials and post-authorisation monitoring.""
Heart inflammation 
Researchers looked at ""adverse events"" from nearly 300 million vaccine doses given in the US between December 2020 and June 2021. 
Members of the public, healthcare providers and drug companies can report any possible side-effect, using the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, external (VAERS), run by the CDC and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
A second method, V-safe, allows individuals to fill out a survey on their smartphone in the months after vaccination. 
Both systems rely on individuals deciding to self-report an adverse event.
The results of the study are published in the Lancet medical journal, external:
From the VAERS data, the CDC received more than 340,000 reports of adverse events after vaccination, with 92% registered as mild
The most common side effects were headaches, fatigue, fever and chills
Of the more than 22,000 events recorded as serious, the most common was shortness of breath
Other serious events, including a form of heart inflammation known as myocarditis, have already been identified following both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccinations, although that side-effect is very rare. 
Because Covid jabs were originally authorised in the United States under emergency-use provisions, healthcare providers are required to report all deaths following vaccination, whether a doctor suspects a ""plausible"" link or not.
About 4,500 deaths were recorded in the six months to June 2021, more than 80% among people aged 60 and over. 
Death rates
""The rapid pace at which Covid-19 vaccines were administered under emergency use, especially among older populations, was unprecedented,"" the CDC's Dr David Shay said.
""Due to their age, this group already has a higher baseline mortality rate than the general population and our results follow similar patterns of death rates for people in this age group following other adult vaccinations.""
The researchers said less than 1% of people who filled out the V-safe survey had sought any medical care following vaccination.
Dr Elizabeth Phillips, a professor of medicine, at Vanderbilt University, who was not involved in the study, said: ""Reassuringly, the six-month VAERS data supports that - although approximately one in 1,000 individuals vaccinated may have an adverse effect, most of these are non-serious.
""For adverse events of special interest, it is reassuring that there were no unexpected [safety] signals other than myocarditis and anaphylaxis, already known to be associated with mRNA vaccines.""

Refugees arriving at the Polish border
The World Bank has approved $723m (£551m) in loans and grants for Ukraine, as the country fights against a Russian invasion.
The bank said it is continuing to work on another $3bn package of support in the coming months for the country.
It also promised extra help for neighbouring countries that are taking in more than 1.7m refugees, which are mostly women, children and the elderly.
The financial package for Ukraine includes a $100m pledge from the UK.
""The World Bank Group is taking quick action to support Ukraine and its people in the face of the violence and extreme disruption caused by the Russian invasion,"" the bank's president David Malpass said in a statement, external. 
The bank said the funds would help Ukraine's government provide critical services, including wages for hospital workers, pensions for the elderly and social programmes for the vulnerable.

It is also made up of $134m in grants from Britain, Denmark, Latvia, Lithuania and Iceland, as well as $100m of financing from Japan.
Last week, Mr Malpass told the BBC that the war was ""a catastrophe"" for the world which will cut global economic growth.
""The war in Ukraine comes at a bad time for the world because inflation was already rising,"" he said.
He stressed that his biggest concern was ""about the pure human loss of lives"".

Pressure is growing on Western food and drink giants to pull out of Russia due to the invasion of Ukraine.
McDonald's and Coca-Cola have been criticised on social media for failing to speak out about the attacks and continuing to operate in the country.
Well-known firms including Netflix and Levi's have already suspended sales or stopped providing services in Russia.
McDonald's and Coca-Cola have not responded to the BBC's request for comment.
#BoycottMcDonalds and #BoycottCocaCola were trending on Twitter on Monday and over the weekend respectively.
Dragon's Den investor Deborah Meaden also spoke out on social media against the fizzy drinks company, urging people to stop drinking its products.

The criticism comes amid calls for other well-known Western firms such as KFC, Pepsi, Starbucks and Burger King to close their outlets and stop sales in Russia.
However, most firms have stayed silent on the issue with Pepsi, Starbucks and Burger King also declining to respond to the BBC's requests for comment.
Fast food chain KFC did not respond initially but its owner Yum Brands, which also owns Pizza Hut, has since announced that it has suspended future investments in Russia.
Yum Brands is the world's second-biggest restaurant chain, and there are about 1,000 KFC outlets and 50 Pizza Hut restaurants in Russia. The company was not pulling out entirely, but Yum said that it would ""redirect all profits from operations in Russia to humanitarian efforts"". It is also donating $1m (£762,000) to the Red Cross.
Big presence
Many of the firms the BBC has contacted have a large number of stores in the country.
In recently-published information on its website, external, McDonald's said that it has 847 stores in Russia. The company also owns the majority of these outlets, whereas across the rest of the world most are typically operated by franchisees.
Both McDonald's and Pepsi, who have had a presence in Russia for decades, have also been singled out by the boss of New York state's pension fund.
The oldest Russian McDonald's branch, off Pushkin Square in central Moscow, opened in 1990.
Thomas DiNapoli, comptroller of the New York state common retirement fund, wrote letters to the companies, according to Reuters reports, urging them to review their businesses in Russia because they face ""significant and growing legal, compliance, operational, human rights and personnel, and reputational risks"".
Often, franchise owners will be able to take the decision as to whether or not to shut chains down, depending on terms of agreements they might have with big food chains like KFC or Starbucks.
In a recent statement, Kevin Johnson, the boss of Starbucks, described attacks on Ukraine as ""unprovoked"" and ""unjust"".
But most of its sites in Russia remain open, according to its website. Most of these franchises are run by the Kuwait-based Alshaya Group.
Kathleen Brooks, director at Minerva Analysis, said McDonald's and Coca-Cola were ""very complicated businesses"", which would not make it easy to make a decision to leave Russia quickly.
She told the BBC's Today programme that Coca-Cola had an ""incredibly complicated structure"" with bottling plants in Russia.
""I don't think it's as simple as saying can you just pull out of Russia,"" she said. ""These are complicated businesses and there's a lot to consider, but right now the reputation risk could really hit their share prices so they may have no choice going forward.""
'Ethical compass'
But Dr Ian Peters, director of the Institute for Business Ethics, told BBC News: ""This is not a time to sit on the fence. 
""The world is likely to judge companies by what they do in such circumstances, and ethical judgement will be as important as complying with any government-led regulations and sanctions.""
He said that most firms would have what they refer to as an ""ethical compass"" they use to make big decisions.
""We would advise firms in such circumstances always to look at the bigger picture and seek to do the right thing, putting the wider interest above short-term profit,"" he added.
He cited important ethical dilemmas that might come up for companies when considering to suspend operations in Russia too: What duty of care do these companies hold to employees on the ground? Is it fair to deprive Russian citizens of basic goods?
Professor of business ethics at Henley Business School, Kleio Akrivou, suggested that these types of decisions might be more difficult to reach for food companies than, say, consulting firms.
""When it comes to sanctions which deprive the Russian population of its basic goods and dignity, firms may need to approach the situation more thoughtfully, with an appeal to practical reason.""
She said now is the time for fast food giants to balance how real people are affected by such moves, alongside any reputational risk.

141,141,"Chaos, upheaval and exhaustion for Ukraine's disabled children","Tue, 08 Mar 2022 01:39:31 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-60648735,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-60648735?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,The BBC's Fergal Keane travels on a bus with disabled children fleeing the bombed city of Kharkiv.,"Chaos, upheaval and exhaustion for Ukraine's disabled children
They had been travelling for thirty hours already. There were many hours ahead. The bus to the Polish border was a capsule of exhaustion, grief and tender mercies. Carers hugged the frightened children and whispered soothing sounds. It was not a time or place for words. There were none that could have explained the madness engulfing the world of the children from Kharkiv's Hippocrates Care Centre. They were aged between one and three and all were disabled, with serious medical conditions. 
Before the bus there had been the train across the land from east to west, and before the train a journey in cars through stricken Kharkiv. Shells were falling close by and the noise sparked terror in the children. The dash to the station was their first trip outside of a bomb shelter since the Russian invasion began.
The city of Kharkiv is only 54 kilometres from the Russian border and was one of the first places targeted in the invasion. Hundreds of thousands of its residents have since fled for neighbouring countries, the majority to Poland. One of the young carers on the bus, Iryna Miroshnichenko, said that when the bombardment began staff had to make an urgent decision: hide in the basement shelter of the centre or to try to leave immediately. Either way they ran the risk of death or serious injury.
It was an agonising dilemma for people who had never known war and for whom the care of the children is something like a sacred responsibility. It can be seen in the gentleness with which they treat their young charges.
Kharkiv, where the children's centre is based, was one of the first places bombed during the invasion
""It's very deplorable. It is really, really bad. We are being bombed from morning till night. We've been in the bomb shelter all this time. We were there with all of the kids, all of them hiding,"" said Iryna. 
The director of the centre, Valentyna Shlyahova, went back and forth through the crowded bus reassuring children and encouraging her staff. She has a disabled daughter who has already been evacuated to safety. Another older daughter and her family have also left Kharkiv. They are all among the 1.5 million people forced out of their homes by President Putin's decision to invade Ukraine.
Valentyna gestured towards a pair of children who were crying relentlessly. 
""We are tired ourselves and the children are tired. You hear how the children behave? They also want calm, silence, cosiness and warmth,"" she said.
Unicef estimates that 7.5 million children in Ukraine are in danger from the conflict and require urgent assistance. Shelling has hit hospitals, restricted the work of emergency services and is creating a major wave of trauma among the young. Half a million children have fled out of Ukraine with their families.
A week ago, Unicef's executive director, Catherine Russell, called for respect for the laws of war to protect children. 
""We renew our call on all parties to protect civilians and civilian infrastructure - and to abide by all legal and moral obligations to keep children out of the line of fire. We must protect all children in Ukraine. Now. They need peace,"" she said. 
In the week since she made that statement Russia has escalated the conflict.
To those of us witnessing the exodus of refugees the most striking feature is the huge numbers of children of all ages who are on the move. Most are travelling with their mothers. All men of fighting age are being ordered to stay behind unless they have a medical or job exemption. The demands of the war supersede those of families.
Unicef estimates that 7.5 million children in Ukraine are in danger from the conflict
One of the most powerful images of this conflict is that of mothers and carers patiently shepherding children through the chaos that has ruptured family lives. It is an inspiring counterpoint to the obscenity of this war.
I asked director Valentyna Shlyahova what the children meant to her. She smiled. ""Many people ask me why I do it. I would say that twenty years ago fate took a turn and I took this job. Let me say to you that I feel that I am needed here.""
Valentyna has no idea when she or the children will be able to return to Ukraine or what kind of country they will find when that moment comes. But she will be with them, whatever lies ahead.

This footage from a 2020 TV series is being shared with claims it shows actors being made up to be victims of the Ukraine war
Nearly two weeks after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the flow of false or misleading information about the war hasn't let up and now there are some outlandish theories being shared online.
Some have begun to circulate claims the war is a hoax, a media fabrication, or has been exaggerated by the West in terms of its scale. 
We've examined some of them.
False claims about ""crisis actors""
A video of a young woman and a young man having fake blood applied to their faces has racked up millions of views on multiple platforms.
It is shared as supposed evidence that the war in Ukraine is a hoax and civilian victims are actually ""crisis actors"" - people hired to act out scenes from an attack.
This image is from a 2020 Ukrainian TV series and unrelated to the Russian invasion
But the video is unrelated to the war. It was shot in 2020 on the production set of Ukrainian TV series Contamin, external.
The male actor can be seen in behind-the-scenes images from the set, external tweeted in December 2020.

Moving corpse
A video of a news reporter in front of multiple body bags has gone viral on several major social networks, and has been spread widely by pro-Kremlin accounts.
Seconds into the clip, one of the body bags starts moving, a man removes the cover and is attended to by a photographer. 
Social media posts claim the video was shot in Ukraine and proves the war is either a hoax or manufactured by ""Western propaganda"".
Video of a climate change protest in Vienna is being presented as fake Ukrainian victims from the war
But the claims are false. The video clip is from a climate change protest in Vienna in early February, as reported by Austrian newspaper Osterreich, external. Organised by ""Friday for Future"" climate activists, the depiction of body bags aimed to highlight the danger of carbon emissions to human life.
The same video was shared by conspiracy groups last month with false claims that it showed a Covid ""crisis actor"", external.
False wooden guns claim 
A screenshot of a Fox News broadcast showing two Ukrainian men holding what appear to be wooden guns has gone viral.
It is often accompanied by false claims that the war in Ukraine is a hoax and the fact that they are not real guns is proof of this.
Fake guns were given to civilian volunteers willing to train to defend their communities before the war
The footage actually dates back to mid-February, before the war began. 
It was taken during a training course provided by the far-right Azov battalion for civilian volunteers in the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv willing to defend themselves and their communities in case of a Russian invasion.

Steven Seagal is not fighting in Ukraine
A false tweet - seemingly sent by CNN's verified Twitter account - claims US actor Steven Seagal, who is a dual US-Russian national, has been spotted ""among Russian special forces"" near Ukraine's capital of Kyiv.
Along with ordinary users, the tweet has been picked up by influential accounts with huge followings, including US podcast host Joe Rogan, who shared it with his 14 million followers on Instagram.
A false tweet about Steven Seagal fighting in Ukraine was shared by Joe Rogan
But Mr Seagal is not fighting alongside Russian forces in Ukraine, and the tweet was probably generated by one of the multiple free online tools that enables users to create fake - but authentic-looking - tweets from verified accounts. 
The actor, 69, told Fox News last week he looked at both countries as ""one family"", external and hoped for a ""positive, peaceful resolution"".
CNN said the image was fabricated, external and it had ""never reported anything like this"". 
Mr Rogan later deleted his Instagram post.
Russian diplomat shares false tweet
A Russian diplomat has shared screenshots showing a fabricated story about a journalist being killed in Ukraine during the Russian invasion.
""How to make a fake… colleagues, beware, the main battle is not in Ukraine, it's with lies and fakes of MSM"" tweeted Dmitry Polyansky, Russia's deputy ambassador to the UN, referring to ""mainstream media"" as MSM.
His post was accompanied by a tweet alleging that CNN had reported on the death of ""Bernie Gores"" in Ukraine, after sharing a story about the same man's demise in Afghanistan during the Taliban takeover last year.
An image of YouTuber Jordie Jordan was used with a false identity to claim he was reported as dead in Ukraine by CNN
But the screenshots presented as proof of fabrication come from fake CNN accounts - both of which have since been suspended by Twitter. And the man presented in the images as Bernie Gores is in fact a YouTuber, who is very much alive, called Jordie Jordan.
A CNN representative told fact-checkers from Reuters the posts were ""absolute fiction"", external.

False footage 
Different versions of a video of a large crowd being asked by a director to run and scream in fear have racked up hundreds of thousands of views on multiple platforms.
It is claimed the video was leaked from Ukraine, suggesting some of the distressing scenes run by media outlets are actually fabricated. 
Behind-the-scenes footage from the film Invasion Planet Earth is being shared in the context of the Ukraine invasion
But the video was actually shot in Birmingham's Victoria Square in 2013 for the sci-fi film Invasion Planet Earth, which at the time was titled Kaleidoscope Man.
The film's director, Simon Cox, said on Twitter he was ""shocked to see my footage being used like this"", external.
Vice-president's wife didn't join army
Social media users have been sharing an image allegedly showing the wife of a 'Ukrainian vice-president' who has joined the country's armed forces to fight the Russian invasion.
However, Ukraine does not have a vice-president.
Twitter users have wrongly claimed that the woman in the picture is the Ukrainian vice-president's wife
Another version of the claim doing the rounds on Twitter wrongly suggests that the woman in the picture is Ukraine's first lady Olena Zelenska.   
Fact-checkers Logically have ascertained, external that the photograph is an image of a Ukrainian soldier from August 2021. 
The original photo was taken during a rehearsal for a military parade in Kyiv.

The Guardian reports from Odesa, external on Ukraine's Black Sea coast, where preparations are under way to fight off any Russian assault. 
It says nobody there can believe Mr Putin could attack a city with ""almost mythical resonance"" for many Russians, but adds the Russian armed forces have done lots of things in recent days that seemed unthinkable just two weeks ago. 
A Ukrainian defence volunteer in Odesa has written to the i, external explaining people are ready not only to defend - but to attack. ""There is no fear at all"", Roman Vlasov tells the paper, ""just focus, and determination"".
The Daily Mirror tells the story of a desperate Ukrainian builder, external who has been working in London and is now trying to get his family, who are stranded in Calais, to the UK. 
The paper accuses the government of placing obstacles in the way of traumatised refugees. 
The editor of the i, Oliver Duff, describes the UK's response to the crisis as increasingly shameful, external and in contrast with great public generosity. 
The Daily Mail has a similar message in its editorial, arguing that nothing has been learned from the evacuation of Afghanistan last summer and urging the government to ""fix the visa shambles""., external

Meanwhile, many papers address the impact of the war for domestic energy prices in the UK. 
The Financial Times describes ""an extraordinary day of trading volatility"",, external with a new spike in oil and gas prices. 
The Daily Express says there is no alternative but to move towards renewables and calls higher bills in the meantime ""the price we must pay to defeat Putin"". 
The Daily Mail says Boris Johnson signalled there would be more drilling in the North Sea, what it calls a new ""dash for gas"", and predicts a new generation of nuclear power. 
The UK must ""seize this moment"" to start fracking, external, the Sun argues, adding it's ""shameful"" that it took a war to jump start a review of energy strategy.

Sandra Oh says we should ""normalise"" girls having periods in films
""Hey, all girls have periods. So let's normalise that - and celebrate it!""
Killing Eve star Sandra Oh is pretty choosy about her roles - but she tells the BBC she jumped at voicing a character for Pixar's latest film Turning Red.
It tackles blushing, big emotions and, yes, periods. 
""I was just so happy there was a film about it,"" Oh continues.
""Storytelling wise, I don't think we really mention it enough, so to be a part of a film that embraced puberty was important to me.""
'Poofs' into a panda
She plays Ming, the mother of 13-year-old Mei, a diligent, slightly nerdy Chinese-Canadian schoolgirl.
Mei is navigating her life pretty well, at least until she's hit with a rush of hormones.
This can be derailing at the best of times, but whenever Mei feels overwhelmed or something makes her feel uncomfortable, she ""poofs"" into a giant red panda.
The chaotic consequences are a direct metaphor for the reality young girls can face, as they are hit with some pretty big physical and mental changes.
Mei's friends are really supportive of her panda predicament
Rosalie Chang plays Mei, whose panda alter-ego is a bit like a more cuddly version of the Incredible Hulk. 
Chang said the film resonated with her in real life.
""I went through puberty throughout this film,"" she explains - and unlike her character, she says it without a hint of embarrassment.
""I mean, I was 12 when I started it, and I'm now 16. This film is unapologetic about tackling puberty. It's not trying to hide, it's not trying to be wishy washy. It just says it straight up. 
""It's a really taboo subject, even though everyone goes through it.""
Learning to adapt to a new body makes for some comedic moments in the film
Chang saw the clumsy, emotional panda as a ""metaphor for change and messiness"".
""It's so similar, yet different from me - she growls a little more, she has bigger outbursts,"" she laughs.
Although Pixar has explored a young girl's emotions in Inside Out, along with mother-daughter tensions in Brave, Turning Red is its first foray into puberty. It's not a theme that crops up very often in family films. 
Director Domee Shi says the idea of including periods and the embarrassment girls can feel was ""there from the very beginning"".
The film touches on menstruation very gently, and Mei is particularly embarrassed by her mother's response.
""It didn't feel right if we didn't talk about it,"" says the film-maker, who won 2019's short animation Oscar for Bao, and co-wrote Turning Red with Julia Cho.

Newsound Special: Let's Talk About Periods!
Producer Lindsey Collins adds they tested out responses to the film during early screenings for Pixar colleagues.
""Just getting the reaction from the crowd of laughter and shock - it was the best response we could get,"" she says.
Carolyn Danckaert, founder of the website A Mighty Girl, which includes advice, external for girls and parents about periods, tells the BBC that many parents ""struggle to initiate conversations with their kids on topics like puberty and periods, which tween girls often find embarrassing"". 
""When you watch a movie together, however, you can use the character's experience as an opportunity to broach these subjects with a little emotional distance that can put kids at ease.""
Research suggests some girls miss school because of their period
Emma Thompson O'Dowd, health and wellbeing specialist at global children's charity Plan International UK, calls the inclusion of periods in the film ""wonderful"".
Their research, external suggests that ""when girls first start their period, over two-fifths feel anxious, and a third feel embarrassed"". 
""Nearly two million UK girls have missed a part day or full day of school because of their period, many out of fear of experiencing leaks,"" she adds.
""All children, but especially girls, need to learn that periods are a healthy and normal part of life. Films like Turning Red help can smash the taboos around periods, and create opportunities for open and honest conversations."" 
Turning Red's line-up: Director Domee Shi, Sandra Oh, Rosalie Chang and producer Lindsey Collins
This film is also notable as the first Pixar movie directed solely by a woman - with an all-female key filmmaking team and an Asian-led cast.
Interestingly, Chang didn't notice this; to her it was just film-making which happened to be done by women.
""I didn't even realise it was all-female leadership until the wrap party when I first saw the movie,"" she says, while Oh adds: ""There are a lot of firsts with Turning Red, and I think all those should be celebrated.""
Pixar, which was bought by Disney in 2006, external, has made films including The Incredibles, Toy Story and Finding Nemo, and has won numerous awards including 18 Oscars.
Collins said the female crew felt very supported by Pixar's executives, who did not get cold feet about the film's subject matter.
She added that being all-female ""gave us permission to stay bold"". 
""When we were talking about cringey, awkward moments in the story, you could have had a bunch of people going 'I don't know about that part...' but instead, you were surrounded by women going 'Oh my gosh, that totally happened to me'.""
Director Domee Shi wanted to depict life in a Chinese-Canadian home, ""making dumplings with your mom as your dad makes a meal""
Turning Red is also part of a surge in popularity for Asian-led films and TV shows, including Oscar-nominated Drive My Car and Raya and the Last Dragon, along with Oscar-winning Parasite and the hugely popular Squid Game, to name just a few.
Shi, who is Chinese-Canadian, talks about the importance of ""being what you can see"".
""There wasn't a lot of representation of myself and my family growing up, and I didn't get to see a lot of myself in media,"" she says. 
""I really wanted to just share this Chinese-Canadian girl's experience with the world because it's so specific.""
How Asian film could take over from Hollywood
Oh, who is Asian-Canadian-American, told Elle Canada, external in 2020 she is ""specifically interested in roles that explore a character's race"".
""This is exactly the project that I was looking for,"" she says about Turning Red, clearly delighted there are now ""more opportunities to tell stories I wasn't able to tell early on in my career"". 
Dr Martha M Lauzen, the founder and head of San Diego's Center for the Study of Women in Television and Film, tells the BBC: ""The time is long overdue for a female-driven film, directed solely by a woman, from Pixar. 
Historic high
""It's great to see the studio betting on the promise of Domee Shi's previous unique and brilliant work, Bao.""
Dr Lauzen adds that in 2020, Asians and Asian-Americans comprised 6% of all female characters in speaking roles in the top-grossing films.
This was down from a historic high of 10% in 2018 [when Crazy Rich Asians pushed their representation to a historic high], according to the It's a Man's (Celluloid) World study, external. 
""Due to films like Raya and the Last Dragon and Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, I expect the percentages of both female and male Asian and Asian-American characters to increase in 2021,"" she adds. 
Mei sometimes finds her Mum extremely embarrassing, even though she's trying to help
Turning Red also focuses on mothers and daughters across the generations in Mei's family. 
Ming wants her daughter to honour their traditions by working at the family temple, but resists Mei's urges to go out and be a typical teenager.
Oh talks about this sometimes tricky relationship, calling Ming ""loving and hypervigilant"", which is a pretty accurate description.
""I don't know one person who doesn't have some sort of complicated relationship with their mother,"" she says. ""We're not shying away from it. It's a loving place, but it's also a complicated time in a in a young person's life.""
Shi adds there were a lot of people on the crew of Asian or immigrant backgrounds, with ""similar stories of feeling that pressure and tension with their moms and parents"".
""It was really important for us to tell this nuanced story,"" she explains. 
""Mei genuinely loves her mom and wants to be a good daughter, but she's growing up in a world that's very different from her parents.""
Mei and her school friends are keen to become more independent
Mei finds the film's boyband 4*Town particularly enticing, and along with hordes of other teenagers, is desperate to go to their concert.
""Unfortunately it doesn't align with what Ming thinks is best or appropriate,"" says Chang, while Collins adds: ""When you're 13, going to your first concert is life or death - it's a big deal."" 
Although 4*Town are fictional, their three songs in the film were written by none other than pop star Billie Eilish, and her musician brother Finneas O'Connell, who also jointly wrote the Bond theme for No Time to Die. 
Collins explains they approached them because ""there's something about being able to speak to a generation"".
Billie Eilish agreed to co-write 4*Town's songs
""My kids are big music lovers, and in 2016, they were constantly playing Ocean Eyes by Billie Eilish, external, so clearly it spoke deeply to them,"" she adds. 
But despite the appeal of 4*Town, it's really the giant red panda which takes centre stage in this film. 
Given the option to decide on her own spirit animal, what would Oh choose? 
""I do love the idea of being able to soar and fly, but not like a teeny bird.... 
""I'd be a killer bird,"" she says with a chuckle.
That could be another film entirely - perhaps one about the menopause.
Turning Red is streaming on Disney+ on 11 March.

Racheal Diyaolu has been taking cover in her university's bunker since the Russian invasion
An Irish medical student is attempting to leave Ukraine after sheltering for days from airstrikes and shelling in the eastern town of Sumy.
Racheal Diyaolu, who is 19 and from Carlow, was among hundreds of international students in the city close to Ukraine's border with Russia.
Sumy has been under attack by Russia since its invasion started last month.
Racheal told BBC News NI she had been mentally ""blocking out"" the dangers she faced.
It is understood she left Sumy on Monday after she was picked up by two Scottish men attempting a rescue who her family had been in contact with.
Her sister, Christiana, said she had passed safely through a number of checkpoints and was staying overnight at a ""safe stopover location"" before a curfew begins.
""The relief just knowing that they're safe and sheltered,"" she told BBC Radio Ulster's Evening Extra programme.
""We're hoping for the best now.""
A previous rescue effort failed on Sunday when a minivan used by the men was targeted by ""warning shots"" from Russian forces as they tried to enter Sumy, Racheal said.
However, they managed to reach an agreed pick-up location on Monday morning.
Change of plans
On Monday night, Racheal said that the group planned to head for Moldova on Tuesday.
""Hopefully we'll be able to get to the border and find our way through, and get home soon,"" she said in a video, posted on Twitter.

Earlier, she had told RTÉ's Morning Ireland programme they hoped to travel in the direction of Poland, a journey which could take up to 20 hours.
She was not sure if they could make use of humanitarian corridors. 
""I have left behind lots of friends who are still stuck there and still looking for ways to get out, and most of my belongings as well,"" she explained.
""I'm fine, just trying to stay in high spirits and keep positive that we'll make it to Poland.""
Christiana said the Scottish men had their phones seized during the attack on Sunday before being told to turn back.
""Luckily they were able to find an alternative route into Sumy and stayed there overnight and then continued their mission this morning,"" she added.
Racheal has been studying in Ukraine since November
The Irish Department of Foreign Affairs told BBC News NI it was aware of 52 Irish citizens remaining in Ukraine.
On Sunday, UN monitors said 364 civilian deaths had been confirmed in Ukraine since the invasion began on 24 February, but the real figure was likely to be ""considerably higher"".
Ms Diyaolu arrived in the country from the Republic of Ireland for her studies last November.
Since the invasion started, she has been taking cover in her university's bunker when air raid sirens have sounded.
""Someone will come and knock on your door on all the floors to let them know that it's time to go down and take cover, bring your essentials and your documents,"" she told BBC News NI before her latest attempt to leave Sumy.
The Ukrainian deputy prime minister has said Russia is striking civilian targets in Ukraine, including hospitals, nurseries, and schools.

IN DEPTH: Full coverage of the conflict
At the beginning of the invasion, Russian tanks and troops poured into Ukraine at points along its borders including northern regions such as Sumy. 
Ms Diyaolu said it had been ""an out-of-body experience"" to know there is such danger outside.
""I've had to train my mind to block out the fact that this is incoming danger,"" she told BBC News NI.
""It does happen so frequently at this point that you kind of don't have time to be afraid any more.""
Russian forces have been heavily shelling towns outside the capital of Kyiv
The student said things had become quite difficult in Sumy, ""especially for people who are trying to get out"".
""It's been quite hard going, we've had a lot of air strike threats, we've had quite a few bombs being dropped,"" she said.
'I haven't lost hope'
The medical student said she had tried to ""hold on to hope"" that she would be able to get home.
""It's especially hard on my mother, she's just worried to death all day every day, trying to get in contact with me,"" she said.
""The best thing I can do is stay calm when I am talking to her, letting her know that I'm OK.
""I know that I'm in a scary situation and in a dangerous area, but letting her know that I'm OK, mentally and physically, and that my mind is with them at home and my mind is focused on staying safe and trying to find ways to get out.""
Ms Diyaolu's family have been calling for more help from the Irish government to bring the 19-year-old home.
Ireland's Department of Foreign Affairs said it could not comment on specific cases, but confirmed it was in contact with Irish citizens in Ukraine.
It has advised people to ""shelter in a secure place"" or, if it is safe to do so, to ""consider leaving Ukraine, depending on their location and prevailing circumstances"".

Gulsum Kav, founder of We Will Stop Femicide
Femicide - the killing of women and girls because of their gender - is the most extreme form of gender-based violence, but in many countries no record is kept of the number of cases. BBC 100 Women spoke to three women who carry out detective work to identify femicides, and obtain justice for victims.
Gulsum Kav began a campaign to stop femicide in 2010, the year after the dead body of a teenager, Munevver Karabulut, was found in a bin in Istanbul. It took police more than six months to track down the suspect, leading to protests on the streets of Istanbul.
One of Gulsum's goals was to understand how many murders take place in Turkey, in which the killer's motive is gender-related.
Another was to provide support to Munevver's family as the case came to trial. ""We have a slogan today, 'You will never walk alone,' which came from this,"" she says.
But soon Gulsum and her fellow activists in We Will Stop Femicide found themselves taking on the role of investigators.

""It started when a letter arrived from a family who believed their daughter had died in suspicious circumstances,"" she says.
This was the case of Esin Gunes, a young teacher whose body was found at the bottom of a cliff in Siirt province, south-eastern Turkey, in August 2010.

What is femicide?
Femicide is defined as ""the murder of women because they are women, external"" or ""the gender-related killing of women and girls, external"" 
Eighteen countries in Latin America and the Caribbean have adopted specific laws making femicide a criminal offence
In many other countries the word is not widely used, but is increasingly being adopted by campaigners against gender-based violence
Esin's husband said they had gone to the area for a walk and a picnic, and she had slipped to her death. While the authorities initially accepted this story, the family didn't, as Esin had only recently returned to her husband after walking out and saying she wanted a divorce.
Gulsum's team commissioned a report which proved it was not physically possible to fall in the way she did and that she must have been thrown. This led to her husband's conviction for murder, and he was sentenced to life imprisonment.
Since that first case, the team has worked on over 30 suspected femicides. 
""We often have to gather evidence ourselves and do work like the police,"" says Leyla Suren, a volunteer lawyer for the group.
Another case was that of Yagmur Onut, a university student who was shot in the neck in 2016.
Her boyfriend claimed her death was an accident, but Yagmur's mother, Sevgi, believed her daughter had been murdered and contacted We Will Stop Femicide for help.

""They told me the struggle starts now,"" Sevgi says. ""I started my struggle along with them.""
It wasn't until January this year that the boyfriend was finally convicted of murder and sentenced to 16 years in prison.
""When you examine Yagmur's past you see that she is not a young woman who would make jokes with guns, but we had to struggle for six years to prove it,"" says Leyla. 
The Supreme Court is now going to consider appeals. The prosecution argues the defendant should have been convicted of a graver offence (premeditated murder), while the defence argues the offence he is convicted of is already too severe.
The Turkish authorities have begun releasing data on the number of women murdered in the country, but Gulsum says the official figure is always lower than her organisation's.
She says it's impossible to separate her personal life from this struggle, but it is worth it to create a country where women are safe.
""We won't stop, we won't give up until women live with equal rights, in freedom.""

Geraldina Guerra tracks cases and maps the lives of victims of femicide in Ecuador to keep their memories alive
'Counting bodies is the best place to start'
Naeemah Abrahams has been leading a team of researchers for the past 20 years to learn more about femicide in South Africa.
While activists in some countries gather information from their network of contacts, or from the media, Naeemah and her team from the South Africa Medical Research Council (SAMRC) start their work at the mortuary.
""We need to go beyond looking at cases which are already in the judicial system because otherwise this leaves out many cases where the police have already decided they are not going to prosecute, or other cases that the police haven't picked up at all,"" she says.
""Counting bodies is the best place to start.""
At state mortuaries up and down the country, data collectors employed by the SAMRC meticulously examine pathology reports.
First they determine whether a woman was murdered, they then look for other characteristics such as the way she was killed, and evidence of a fight or rape. 
""We then try to link up the file with a police investigation. But in many cases, we don't find any, and even if there is one, many times the police haven't found a perpetrator,"" she says.
""So we go on to do interviews with the police, collect data on the perpetrator so we can start to better identify the type of femicide it was - whether it was an intimate partner femicide or non-partner femicide."" 
Researchers comb through data for possible evidence of femicide
On International Women's Day Naeemah's team publishes the results of its latest femicide survey, which looks at trends of women murdered in 1999, 2009 and 2017.
""Our hope is the South African government will take over our investigative method of starting at the mortuary level,"" she says.
Naeemah is hopeful for swift change now that the government has asked her team to draw up a femicide prevention strategy for the country.
For Naeemah this work is about making sure femicide cases are properly counted and that the justice system works for everyone.
""We do this to change the lives of women,"" she says.
'We make femicide visible with maps'
A group of women researchers in Ecuador gather data on femicide, but have also found a way of remembering the lives of women who have been killed. 
Ecuador is one of 18 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean that have adopted laws to criminalise femicide, according to the UN. 
This means femicide rates are now being officially recorded. But, as in some other countries, women's rights groups say government figures are far too low.
""We decided to start recording cases systematically so that we could have data to then question the state institutions,"" says Geraldina Guerra, president of Aldea Foundation.

""Through our local contacts from all over the country we are able to spot cases of suspected femicides early on, sometimes long before the police or the media have found out,"" says Nicoletta Marinelli, another member of the team, who lives in Quito.
The group quickly starts investigating, for example by tracing the dead woman's last movements and establishing whether she had previously been a victim of domestic violence.
To begin with the Aldea Foundation made maps to compare the number of women killed in different regions, but then they took the idea a step further.
Now they build ""life maps"", as they call them, which place memories of the woman on a map showing the park where she went on walks, her favourite cafe, the animal shelter where she used to volunteer, or the stadium where she once saw her favourite singer perform.  
""Maps then become social tools, we work with the families to populate them: we mark the spaces that these women once occupied through the voices and memories of those left behind,"" says Nicoletta, who co-ordinated the initiative.
The maps are available on the foundation's website, and the aim is to make the issue of femicide visible, but also relatable. ""This is happening on the streets of your city, streets you are familiar with and walk every day,"" they say.
Part of the Cuenca map, remembering a woman called Gabriela
With funding from the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and as part of the Spotlight Initiative to eradicate all forms of violence against women and girls, they researched and drew maps for three cities in Ecuador.
In Cuenca, a city in the southern Andes mountains, the life map commemorates Maribel Pinto, who was brutally stabbed 113 times in November 2020.
Maribel - an Afro activist and mother of five - was born in a rural area but became a sex worker to make ends meet, after moving to Cuenca. She died at the hands of a 25-year-old mechanic, who was later found guilty of femicide and jailed for 34 years.
Miriam, her daughter, helped build her map with some of the locations that bring back memories of happier days - like the ice cream parlour by the city's cathedral.
Locations such as these are marked on a victim's life map as a clickable link. Here, people are presented with audio recordings from relatives, short descriptions and photos explaining the victim's connection to the place. 
Miriam contributed to the the life map for her murdered mother, Maribel
""We used to come to this place when she had a bit of money to spare, so it'll always remind me of her. Placing her here is like bringing her back to life,"" says the 23-year-old, who has just had a child herself. 
""These maps reconstruct the lives that were truncated but also show the social dimension of the problem,"" adds Geraldina. ""There are brothers and sisters, sons and daughters, grandmothers, mothers and fathers left behind… and we don't seem to talk about that.""
The group hopes that personalising the numbers through the life maps will help start conversations on the subject of femicide.
It also thinks the maps could help lawyers and judges to better understand and frame cases of femicide.
In Geraldina's words: ""Violence endures in silence and femicide will continue as long as we remain silent.""

150,150,Why misogyny is at the heart of South Korea's presidential elections,"Tue, 08 Mar 2022 00:23:44 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-60643446,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-60643446?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,Disgruntled young men who resent feminism are the focus of candidates vying to be president.,"Why misogyny is at the heart of South Korea's presidential elections
Hundreds of South Korean men organized an Anti-#MeToo rally in 2018
Park Min-young, 29, spends most of his day talking to angry young men in Seoul.
His fingers relentlessly tap the keyboard as he replies to dozens of their messages at his desk in the centre of a busy campaign office for one of South Korea's main presidential candidates, Yoon Suk-yeol.
""Nearly 90% of men in their twenties are anti-feminist or do not support feminism,"" he tells me. 
South Korea has one of the worst women's rights records in the developed world. And yet it is disgruntled young men who have been the focus of this country's presidential election. 
Many do not see feminism as a fight for equality. Instead they resent it and view it as a form of reverse discrimination, a movement to take away their jobs and their opportunities.
It is a disparaging development for the tens of thousands of young women who took to the streets of Seoul in 2018 to shout ""Me Too"" after several high profile criminal cases involving sexual harassment and spy camera crimes known as ""molka"". 
But now that cry is being drowned out by men shouting ""Me First"". 
The country's gender politics is a minefield the country's next leader will have to navigate - if they can first win the battle to get into office. 
The contest 
Conservative candidate Mr Yoon and his liberal rival Lee Jae-myung are neck and neck in a contest to become the next leader of Asia's fourth largest economy. 
Voters' top concerns are skyrocketing house prices, stagnant economic growth, and stubborn youth unemployment.
Neither have any experience as legislators in the National Assembly which is a first in South Korea's democratic history. 
And neither appear to have a strong female voting base. Both parties have been accused of misogyny.
Yoon Suk-yeol (R) and Lee Jae-myung (L) are both neck and neck in the contest
Mr Lee's ruling Democratic Party has seen a number of high-profile sexual harassment scandals, with the mayor of Busan sent to prison for sexual assault.
Mr Yoon, of the People's Power Party, has made abolishing the Ministry of Gender Equality and Family a central pledge of his campaign. 
The ministry largely provides family-based services, education, and social welfare for children and spends around 0.2% of the nation's annual budget  - less than 3% of which goes towards the promotion of equality for women. But Yoon knows this move will be popular among a key demographic - young men.
A survey last year by a local newspaper found that 79% of young men in South Korea feel ""seriously discriminated against"" because of their gender.
As I walk with Min-young to a cafe to meet some of these young men, he tells me that ""feminism has been going in the wrong direction"".
He says many men he's spoken to feel ""let down"", adding that he believes it is ""necessary to pacify, to convince and to appease them first"". 
These men claim that they are not trying to drown out the voices of women, but simply to amplify the voices of young men. 
One of their biggest issues is that all men must serve 18 months in the military before they are 30 years old.
""There is no reward. Just sacrifice,"" says Min-young. ""The military is a huge fear for Korean men… that they are forced to go to this place they can't resist for one year and six months. And to have to compete with women after returning from the military.
""This country's patriarchy system also gives women the burden of child rearing, [which means the] men have the burden [of proving] their economic capabilities.""
The men I'm introduced to do stump speeches for Mr Yoon who has declared that there is no systemic gender discrimination in South Korea.
The facts do not support that argument. 
The average monthly wage for a South Korean woman in 2020 was 67.7% of that of a man, according to the Ministry of Employment and Labour. This is the biggest wage gap among developed countries.

Why women in Korea are reclaiming their short hair
#MeToo takes hold in South Korea
Feminists living in fear
Women make up only 5% of boards in South Korea's corporate world. 
When it comes to sexual crimes against women, sentencing has been traditionally low. In the last 10 years 41.4% of perpetrators were given probation, around 30% were given a fine.
That means just over 28% of those found guilty were sent to prison.
The pains of young women however, have been largely ignored in this election. Until now.
A writer for the Korea Herald, Yim Hyun-su noted in an article at the weekend that both candidates have refreshed their appeal to women on social media.
Mr Lee has pledged to tackle discrimination and Mr Yoon declared a ""war on sex crimes"".
In such a close race, it seems they have realised that young women may now hold the deciding votes.
But it will be a tough sell for those who fight for equality in South Korea. They are now scared to reveal their identities. 
We spoke to a group of two men and two women who wanted to face away from our cameras. We have given them fake names to protect them.
The interviewees say identifying yourself as a feminist has unimaginable consequences
""As a feminist to reveal your face and speak out has such unimaginable consequences,"" says Ji-eun, a YouTuber who is in her early 20s.
""When we upload a video on feminism on our YouTube channel, male communities organise an attack and say things like 'You are a feminist? Feminists should all die.'
I have seen these comments for myself. This malicious online bullying can have terrible consequences.
In January, YouTuber BJ Jammi ended her life having endured years of abuse after trolls accused her of being a ""man-hating feminist"".
But amidst the deepening divisions, there is understanding too. Especially when it comes to men having to serve in the military.
""I sympathise with that and the fact that only males have to go is an unjust structure,"" said Ji-eun.
""But the responsibility for this should be on the government and the history of this divided country - but to say to women in their twenties 'Well, you don't go to the military' is very unjust.""
This anti-feminist backlash will be a challenge for whoever steps into the presidential office known as the Blue House. 
South Korea is at a cultural crossroads. It has a tech-savvy young generation who do not share the patriarchal views of their parents or their grandparents. Both genders will likely keep pushing and are looking at those in charge to bring real change. 
But Ji-eun still feels hopeless about her future.
""If the hate was coming from the older generation, I might hope that at some point when my generation is in power or in places of importance in society, it could change. But the anti-feminists and those who don't care about women's rights and spewing hate are in my generation.
""It's hard to picture a bright future even far ahead.""

151,151,I've cut out energy drinks now mum's given me a kidney,"Tue, 08 Mar 2022 06:20:06 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-edinburgh-east-fife-60617800,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-edinburgh-east-fife-60617800?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,Elaine Horne donated a kidney to her 23-year-old son Luke after he almost died from kidney failure.,"I've cut out energy drinks now mum's given me a kidney
Luke Horne and his mum Elaine don't talk about their kidney surgery
Luke Horne's mum is happy he ""has a lovely life now"" since she gave him her kidney following months of gruelling dialysis.
The 23-year-old almost died from kidney failure just over a year ago.
He thinks that having three or four energy drinks a day since he was a teenager may have contributed to his condition. Now he has changed his diet and only drinks water.
After his diagnosis and a period in intensive care, he began dialysis. It lasted for five hours, three times a week, and left him physically drained and with painful headaches.
So when his mum, Elaine, found out she was a match for a kidney transplant she said it was ""a great relief"".
Luke told BBC Scotland: ""I thank her in my own way. We don't talk about it, we are both like that.
""But she definitely knows I'm very thankful for it.
""It's really good of her and I can never thank her enough. She knows that.""
Luke Horne was in hospital for five days after having his kidney transplant
Luke underwent nine months of dialysis before the operation went ahead.
Elaine, 48, who lives in East Linton, said: ""It's a hard experience and he needed to get on with his life.
""We came so close to losing him. We don't dwell on it. I don't think about him having my kidney inside him and he doesn't need to say thank you.
""He has a girlfriend and has a lovely life now. He was friends with her for years but they got together during this experience. 
""I think it made them realise how life can be short.""
In December 2020 Luke had started feeling unwell and lost his sense of taste and smell. He began self-isolating at his home in North Berwick because he thought he had Covid.
Luke drank four energy drinks a day for about eight years
But when his dad, Michael, visited to check up on him through his window, he saw that his son had turned grey and his face and feet were swollen and puffy.
He told his son to go to his GP, and blood samples showed Luke had end-stage kidney failure.
When he reached hospital they told him he just had minutes left to live.
Luke said he had been drinking three to four energy drinks a day since he was 14 or 15.
'My window visit helped save my son’s life'
He said: ""The doctor said it was more than likely that all the energy drinks caused me to have high blood pressure and that caused my kidney failure.
""I liked the taste of them so I didn't think of the consequences. I was just a young, daft laddie.
""They are not good for you, I see that now. Now I only drink water.""
Luke has also changed his diet and does not eat processed foods. He will be on immunosuppressant drugs for the rest of his life.
Luke Horne returned to work as a car mechanic three months after his operation
Dr Charlie Tomson, kidney specialist and trustee at Kidney Research UK, said that over-consumption of energy drinks, which contain a large amount of caffeine, can cause a rise in blood pressure.
""High blood pressure can cause kidney damage directly, and can also accelerate the progression of pre-existing kidney problems,"" he said.
""It is unlikely that energy drinks alone can be a direct cause of kidney failure, but of course moderation is key.""
Elaine, who had the kidney transplant operation on 8 September last year, said she found it hard watching her son go through dialysis.
""It was physically draining for him and he would get extremely sore heads after it,"" she said.
""He couldn't go out with his friends because he would be at dialysis, his whole life had to change.
""Dialysis can be a real ordeal for kidney patients, it's tough going.""

She said she did not think twice about donating her kidney to her son.
Elaine, who is now a Kidney Research UK community ambassador, added: ""The consultant makes sure you don't feel pressured to give your kidney. They keep asking you if you want to slow the proceedings down if you don't feel ready.
""I was nervous but because he is my son I was extremely focussed on the end goal. 
""It was the only way we could help. It was a trauma how close he came to dying, it came out of the blue.
""We felt we had no control of the situation so as soon as we could get tested for a transplant we did.""
Elaine said if she had not been a match she would have joined the shared donation scheme, where she would have donated her kidney to a family who had a matching kidney for her son.
She said: ""I'm just his mum, you do anything to help your kids, I would have felt worse if I had been told I couldn't help him.""

Dr Sangram Kapale ran a giant Covid treatment centre in Maharashtra during the pandemic
The first wave of Covid-19, that swept India in early 2020, was a gruelling experience for Dr Sangram Kapale and his colleagues.
""The kind of mental pressure we were all going through is very difficult to put in words,"" he says.
""It was about saving lives with minimal resources. We had a lack of medicine, beds, oxygen.
""The lack of skilled manpower, like paramedics, was another issue. We were forced to use medical students who had no practical experience of handling patients.""
Dr Kapale was in charge of a temporary Covid treatment centre in Pune, Maharashtra which had 800 beds. The centre became overwhelmed with patients, and anxious family members gathered outside.
""On one hand, we were doing everything within our capacity, or beyond, to fight Covid and save lives, and on the other hand we were accused of neglect by the relatives because they didn't know what was happening inside."" 
Staff shortages were a problem when Covid hit India in 2020 meaning some wards had to rely heavily on medical students
Much of the chaos back then can be attributed to lack of resources, according to health care workers. Pre-pandemic, India reported one of the lowest levels of public spending on healthcare in the world.
In 2019, spending on healthcare was equivalent to just 1.5% of India's gross domestic product (GDP, external). By comparison, China spent 6.7% of its GDP, external on health in 2019, and in the UK that figure was 10.2%, external.
Since then, the Indian government has ramped-up its spending and there is a target to spend 2.5% of GDP, external on health by 2025.
Some are hopeful the devastating impact of the pandemic was a turning point for India's entire healthcare system, with a future focus on technology and innovation.
""All aspects of access to healthcare, diagnostics and life-sciences are moving ...to low-cost and high-tech,"" says Akriti Bajaj, an analyst who focuses on healthcare at Invest India, a government funded company promoting investment.
Dozee uses a sensor beneath the bedsheet to monitor a patient's health
There are thought to be more than 6,000 start-ups in the Indian healthcare sector, one of those is Dozee. The firm's technology involves using a smart sensor underneath a patient's bedsheet on a hospital bed. 
It tracks the micro-vibrations produced by the body when the heart pumps blood, and keeps track of a patient's breathing and other movements. These observations are then translated in to data and processed by artificial intelligence-based algorithms which, if anything unusual is detected, can alert nurses and doctors at a central monitoring station.
The company wants to install its technology in more than 1,000 hospitals and 50,000 beds by the end of 2022.

""Our idea was to simplify the entire [monitoring] process, make it more 'patient-centric' and bring the technology to the wards, and even to patients' homes,"" says the company's founder, Mudit Dandwate.
Mr Dandwate believes technology could boost the quality of healthcare across India.
""In India, the crumbling healthcare infrastructure was laid bare [by Covid] - poor hospital infrastructure; acute shortage of doctors; nursing staff and equipment and specialised treatment facilities, particularly in primary healthcare centres, in rural areas.
He says government spending on healthcare has increased over the last two years and both the public and private sector will scale-up their facilities - with technology playing a ""key role"" in that transformation - in the coming years .
Dr Geetha Manjunath hopes her firm's technology will improve the detection of breast cancer
Another health tech entrepreneur, Dr Geetha Manjunath, founded Niramai in Bangalore, in 2016. She wanted to improve cancer screening, particularly in young women.
""Unlike in Europe and the US, where early detection is enabled through regular, systematic screening programmes, India sees high mortality rates, due to late-stage detection,"" she explains.
Dr Manjunath says that in India, more than half of breast cancer cases are seen in women under 50 years of age and traditional X-ray detection has low accuracy among this group, external. 
So, her firm developed a technique for detecting early-stage breast cancer using a small, portable screening device.
A high-resolution thermal sensor is used to measure the temperature variations on the patient's chest, AI then analyses these 400,000 temperature points to generate a report and mark any abnormal regions. 
The thermal imaging is simple to use, meaning the test can be done by lower-skilled health workers, working in more remote areas of India. 
Dr Manjunath says the device makes a more systematic screening programme feasible and that earlier detection could, in turn, reduce treatment costs and save lives.
A ramping-up of India's vaccination programme has helped bring Covid under control
So, what do doctors make of the new technology appearing on some wards?
Dr Manjunth HG, head of the anaesthesia department at KR hospital in Mysore, has used Dozee's system. He says that, while the technology is useful, in his opinion it has its limitations.
""AI has a long way to go, although it is helping the medical fraternity in a great way, it cannot replace humans, ever. Even if AI is helpful, we need doctors and human presence in ICUs and hospitals. So, it's just an assistance for us."" 
Back in Pune, Dr Sangram Kapale is just relieved that, after a second, devastating wave of Covid in 2021, a national vaccination programme appears to have brought the virus under control for the time-being.
""After the vaccinations, the severity of the disease has definitely reduced. As a community, now we have to face whatever it throws at us in future.""

153,153,Ukraine: Small and big ways in which people in the UK are helping out,"Tue, 08 Mar 2022 00:40:09 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-60630054,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-60630054?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,BBC Radio 4's Today listeners share their ideas for ways to help Ukrainians in their time of need.,"Ukraine: Small and big ways in which people in the UK are helping out
When Airbnb announced last week that it was waiving its fees in Ukraine, thousands of people booked stays there without any intention of going - more than 61,000 nights have been booked so far, the company says. 
It's just one of the ways people having been finding to help Ukrainians in their time of need. Here are some other small and big acts of kindness being carried out in the UK. 
Felicity Hansen from the Isle of Mull had been looking for a way to give money directly to those caught up in the war. Following a suggestion on social media, she decided to support Ukrainian artists selling their work on Etsy, an online marketplace. 
First she bought a painting of a poppy from an artist called Anna in the western part of Ukraine, she told Today on BBC Radio 4. After that she began searching ""Ukraine sellers digital downloads"" and came across a child's drawings of cats in the blue and yellow colours of the Ukrainian flag. ""They were such joyful and happy pictures,"" she says. 
She has now bought several pieces from the child from Kyiv, at about £5 each. ""It's a little tiny way that I could help. If it gave that little girl even one moment of happiness, it was well worth it.""
The family posted updates on their Etsy page, and Felicity says they have made it out of Kyiv to western Ukraine. Although they've had to leave everything behind, the money from the drawings is going into a PayPal account which they should be able to access wherever they go.
Many artists and makers in the UK are also selling their work online to raise funds. Dan Jones, who lives in a coastal village in Pembrokeshire, raised £150 by putting his most recent seascape up for auction on Twitter. He'll give it all to a refugee charity.

Baby boxes, batteries and ambulances
A number of people have been inspired to pack aid into the back of a van and deliver it directly to refugees. 
Dorota Darnell from the Norfolk Polonia CIC, an organisation that helps immigrants from EU countries living in the east of England, is working with local companies to collect survival items like batteries, torches and medication. Volunteers are packing them into two lorries heading for Ukraine. 
Roksana, the Polish coordinator, packing donated goods
Meanwhile, in the Highlands, Sarah Perrins and others from her local breastfeeding support group have been donating their old and unused baby boxes to the local Poland association. (All newborns in Scotland are given free packages of essentials, known as a baby box, which includes clothes, thermometers, a changing mat and bedding.)
But one man is going even further, and donating the vehicles themselves.  
Khaled El Mayet from Cheltenham is campaigning to buy second-hand ambulances and drive them, packed with donated goods, to Poland's border with Ukraine. There his team of volunteers will offload the donations and hand over the ambulances so they can be driven over the border into Ukraine to be used in emergencies.
Most countries only have just enough ambulances for peacetime, Khaled told BBC Radio Gloucestershire. ""When a situation like this kicks off, they just don't have enough ambulances to be able to help the civilian population.""
It is something he knows can work, because he has done it before - in 2011, in response to the Arab Spring, he drove ambulances to North Africa. 
Khaled has already raised enough for two second-hand ambulances. ""They are good quality, they're not going to break down whilst trying to save people - and that's really important,"" he says.

Buying goods you never expect to get 
Iain McGlinchey is a retired photographer from Helensburgh, near Glasgow, who has long had a fascination with cameras from Ukraine. Twenty years ago a family friend, who had escaped Nazi Germany and had connections all over Europe, gave him a Russian camera from Kyiv - a cheaper version of a Leica.
For photographers, Ukraine is ""a bit of a mecca"", explains Iain, because of two big Russian camera factories, the FED factory in Kharkov and the Zavod Arsenal factory in Kyiv. 
Some Ukrainian cameras from Iain's collection
This camera is branded ""Kiev""
""I thought, maybe now's the time to buy a camera that I don't actually need,"" says Iain, a self-confessed camera nerd. So he found a small family business in Kyiv and bought a camera from them on eBay - who are waiving seller fees in Ukraine, external, as well as protecting sellers from penalties and negative feedback.
Iain says his motivation is to ""offer a little bit of money and a little bit of moral support"". He sent the seller a message saying: 'I'm not really expecting you to send this, but take the money.'"" 
The seller responded: ""Thank you so much, it's very important that people know the truth. I am not afraid anymore. I'm afraid only for my children."" 
""It's not often an eBay purchase can produce such emotion,"" says Iain.

Ukraine are bidding to reach their second men's World Cup finals
Scotland's World Cup play-off semi-final against Ukraine has been postponed.
The nations were due to meet at Hampden on 24 March but Ukraine requested that Fifa moved the tie back following Russia's invasion of the country.
As a result, the play-off final for the winners - against either Wales or Austria - will now also be delayed.
Scotland aim to play a home friendly on 24 March and an away match against the loser of Wales v Austria on 29 March.
Discussions are under way for a new date for the Ukraine match, with the Nations League window in June the most likely option. Tickets purchased for the 24 March date will be valid for the rescheduled fixture.
The World Cup finals take place from 21 November to 18 December.
What now for Scotland v Ukraine after delay confirmed?
A large contingent of recent squads selected by Ukraine have contained players who play their club football in their homeland, with 15 out of the 23-man pool for November's World Cup qualifiers based in Ukraine.
The sides are due to face each other in June on Nations League duty, with each side already scheduled to play four games during that break.
The Scottish FA say they ""support the decision to uphold the request to postpone the match and reiterate our message of solidarity to our friends and colleagues within the Ukrainian Association of Football"".
And SFA chief executive Ian Maxwell commented: ""The importance and significance of football is greatly diminished in a time of war and our thoughts are with those Ukrainian civilians affected by the conflict.""
Former Scotland assistant manager Mark McGhee agrees with the decision to postpone the play-off semi-final.
""I think it is the right decision, we have got to respect what is going on over there and how it affects their players,"" said the Dundee boss, who won four caps for the national team.
""Ukraine deserve equal opportunity, maybe even more so in the circumstances, and at the moment it would be such a big ask for their players to come and play a game at that level. Even to get them together at this time would be a little bit unfair.
""So I don't think there is anything lost by it. Scotland fans obviously want to know what is happening but I think it is the right thing to do and I don't think anyone at the Scottish FA will have a problem with that.""

155,155,Angel City FC: Eni Aluko on working for the Los Angeles franchise,"Tue, 08 Mar 2022 06:21:16 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/60593513,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/60593513?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,"With Angel City FC kicking off their debut NWSL campaign this month, Eni Aluko tells BBC Sport about moving to LA and meeting the club's all-star backers.","Angel City FC: Eni Aluko on working for the Los Angeles franchise
Eni Aluko won 102 caps for England and scored 33 goals
""Natalie Portman is my boss,"" says Eni Aluko, who has become accustomed to a star-studded workforce since relocating to Los Angeles as sporting director of Angel City FC.
Hollywood actress Portman is part of a majority female ownership group boasting a plethora of A-list investors who have founded the new National Women's Soccer League side, with the club set to make their debut in the competition this month.
Among the extensive high-profile backers are tennis icons Serena Williams and Billie Jean King, Winter Olympic gold medallist Lindsey Vonn, actresses Eva Longoria and Jennifer Garner, TV host James Corden, former US soccer stars Abby Wambach and Mia Hamm and a number of entrepreneurs, YouTubers, pop stars and other former sports professionals. 
It made for a daunting Zoom interview for Aluko after she was approached to take on the role of sporting director, though the former England striker proved a hit with the all-star panel.
""I remember thinking, 'don't look at them - look at you notes and the presentation and try to deliver as best you can what you would do'. And they loved it,"" Aluko tells BBC Sport.
After finishing her professional career at Juventus, Aluko was working as the director for women's football at Aston Villa when the opportunity arose to join the franchise in California, though it was not a straightforward decision.
""You are moving to the other side of the world,"" she explains. ""The whole point of retiring and moving back home was to spend more time with my family and friends, claw back time I missed playing professional football, so it wasn't a no-brainer at all.
""It was more a case of if I don't do this, don't take this unique opportunity to build a club from scratch, I am probably never going to get that opportunity again.""
It helped, of course, that she was struck by the names already entwined in the Angel City project and that is something that has caught the imagination of the Los Angeles locals too, with the club already selling 14,000 season tickets. 
""Meeting them was surreal,"" says Aluko. ""I remember meeting Mia Hamm in Los Angeles for the first time and I was just like 'wow, it's Mia Hamm, this is ridiculous'.
""I watched Julie Foudy win the World Cup, Abby Wambach win the World Cup - and now they are my colleagues.
""Natalie Portman is my boss. I have met her several times, spoken to her kids about football and what training session we are doing - it is a privilege to be given the responsibility to try to build something that is the idea of all these amazing people.""
Angel City vice-president Angela Hucles Mangano, player Christen Press, sporting director Eni Aluko and president Julie Uhrman
One of Aluko's first tasks was to appoint a coach, and after whittling down a shortlist that included male and female applicants she opted for English boss Freya Coombe.
""I am keen on gender balance, I think it is healthy,"" explains Aluko. ""But for Angel City we are very intentional about female leadership, female ownership, female empowerment.
""So Freya was the candidate who best fitted all of that, but her gender was not the leading requirement - she is a competent coach.
""We are very careful as women not to patronise ourselves. If you are the best, competent candidate then you can go up against anyone. We need to back ourselves that whatever the competition we are confident enough and do not create comfort zones.
""Because when you get out into the world of football you don't get to control who you are up against.""
'Now we want to see action on the pitch'
Aluko explains her role as sitting ""between the board and the football side of the club"", setting the tactical and technical strategies, as well as looking after recruitment and managing the budget of the team. 
""There is a separation from the coach having to do all that,"" says Aluko. ""I manage transfers, relationships between clubs both internationally and locally, manage relationships with the league.
""There is a tonne of stuff that traditionally coaches and managers did. Now there is a separation of responsibility between coaches just coaching and all the administrative work that comes with that.""
It is Aluko's job to think mid- to long-term, while the coach concentrates on winning a football match on any given day. 
""We know the turnover of coaches is very high,"" adds the 35-year-old. ""So if you are giving them full responsibility to recruit all the players, what happens if that coach leaves within a year?
""It is a strategy that is too risky for just being specific for one coach.""
Aluko is also keen to manage expectations - despite the pedigree of the club's owners and competitive squad she has put together, the sporting director knows it may take time for Angel City to find their feet in the NWSL this season. 
""We have to be careful to have a balance between being ambitious and understanding how difficult it is to come in and win straight away,"" she says.
""For us, it is about saying 'can we be the most successful expansion team in the NWSL?'
""There has been lots of talk and now we want to see the action on the pitch. We want to see goals, we want to see defending, great assists, the team really gelling together on the pitch. That is why we are doing this.""

Alexander Zverev was thrown out of February's Mexican Open for unsportsmanlike conduct
World number three Alexander Zverev faces an eight-week ban from tennis if he repeats the behaviour which led to his expulsion from the Mexican Open.
In February, the Olympic champion was fined $40,000 (£31,000) and forfeited all his prize money for striking the umpire's chair in Acapulco.
Zverev has now been found guilty of a 'major offence' after an ATP review.
The German 24-year-old will be banned if he commits another similar offence within 12 months of the incident.
Similar offences include unsportsmanlike behaviour and verbal or physical abuse of anyone at a tournament.
As well as the eight-week ban, Zverev has been handed a further suspended $25,000 (£19,000) fine.
The biggest penalty in men's tennis to date was a 16-week suspended ban given to Australian Nick Kyrgios in 2019 for verbally abusing a chair umpire and smashing two racquets.
Zverev has until 11 March to appeal against the decision.
'Some will consider it too lenient' - Analysis
BBC tennis correspondent Russell Fuller
As with Nick Kyrgios, who was also deemed to have committed a major offence for an ugly pattern of behaviour in 2019, Zverev's extra punishment is on hold.
Kyrgios' 16-week ban was suspended for six months, but due to injury the Australian only played half a dozen tournaments in that time.
Zverev, in contrast, will expect to play about 20 events over the next 12 months. 
In that long period of time, he cannot afford to be disrespectful or aggressive to any officials, players or spectators.
Some will consider a suspended sentence too lenient, but the ATP's decision does put the onus on Zverev to change his behaviour in a permanent and meaningful way.

I'm the right man to take England forward - Root
West Indies v England, first Test
Venue: Sir Vivian Richards Stadium, Antigua Dates: 8-12 March Time: 14:00 GMT
BBC coverage: Live text commentary on BBC Sport website & app; daily Test Match Special podcasts
Joe Root says he thought ""long and hard"" about his future as England captain - but he is the right man to ""take the team forward"". 
Root's captaincy came under intense scrutiny following the disastrous Ashes defeat by Australia. 
Since then, head coach Chris Silverwood and director of cricket Ashley Giles have departed, but Root says he still has the appetite to lead England. 
""I've got a lot of energy for it,"" added the 31-year-old Yorkshireman.
Root added: ""I obviously had a long, hard think about things. I feel I'm the right man for the job and I'm very energised in hoping to take this team forward.""
He was speaking ahead of the first Test against West Indies, which starts on Tuesday and his team looking to become only the second England side since 1968 to win a Test series in the Caribbean. 
England in the West Indies - schedule
Robinson ruled out of first Test with back injury
Root, who has led the Test side on 61 occasions, says the series represents an opportunity for England to move past the Ashes defeat. 
""I'm very grateful to get the opportunity - and hopefully this can be a real start of change in our performances,"" he added.
""It's a real chance to start getting back to where we need to be, which is one of the leading teams in Test cricket.""
'A great opportunity for a number of guys to step up'
Pressed on whether he considered stepping down as captain following the Ashes, Root said: ""As with everything, when it comes to playing for England, that always comes first, and whatever I think is best for the team is what I will do.
""I think I'm the right person to take this team forward. I thought long and hard about that and I'm very much looking forward to that opportunity now.
""When I was weighing that up, it would have been wrong to just commit to a short-term thing.
""I always try to do what I think is best for this group of players, whether that is with the bat in hand or as captain of this team.""
England are embarking on the three-match West Indies tour without their top two leading Test wicket-takers in James Anderson and Stuart Broad, who were dropped by interim managing director Andrew Strauss. 
When asked if he considers this a ""fresh start"" for England, Root added: ""This is a great opportunity for a number of guys to step up, take on some different roles, really develop themselves as players and become more leaders within this group.
""We've seen that in small snippets so far. The real test will be, can the guys do it in the Test matches?""

159,159,War in Ukraine: Russia says it may cut gas supplies if oil ban goes ahead,"Tue, 08 Mar 2022 08:04:39 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-60656673,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-60656673?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,A top official says Russia may close its gas lines to Germany if the West halts oil imports.,"War in Ukraine: Russia says it may cut gas supplies if oil ban goes ahead
The Nord Stream 1 gas pipeline was inaugurated just over a decade ago
Russia has said it may close its main gas pipeline to Germany if the West goes ahead with a ban on Russian oil.
Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak said a ""rejection of Russian oil would lead to catastrophic consequences for the global market"", causing prices to more than double to $300 a barrel.
The US has been exploring a potential ban with allies as a way of punishing Russia for its invasion of Ukraine.
But Germany and the Netherlands rejected the plan on Monday.
The EU gets about 40% of its gas and 30% of its oil from Russia, and has no easy substitutes if supplies are disrupted.
While the UK would not be directly impacted by supply disruption, as it imports less than 5% of its gas from Russia, it would be affected by prices rising in the global markets as demand in Europe increases.
Iain Conn, the former boss of British Gas owner Centrica, said natural gas was ""less freely"" traded compared to oil, and it would be ""much more difficult"" to replace Russian gas if supplies are affected as it is transported through fixed pipelines from country to country.
The price of Brent crude - the global benchmark for oil prices - rose to around $130 a barrel on Tuesday following reports that the US and UK will announce its own ban on Russian oil imports.
In an address on Russian state television, Mr Novak said it would be ""impossible to quickly find a replacement for Russian oil on the European market"".
""It will take years, and it will still be much more expensive for European consumers. Ultimately, they will be hurt the worst by this outcome,"" he said.
Pointing to Germany's decision last month to freeze certification of Nord Stream 2, a new gas pipeline connecting the two countries, he added that an oil embargo could prompt retaliation.
""We have every right to take a matching decision and impose an embargo on gas pumping through the [existing] Nord Stream 1 gas pipeline,"" he said.
Could the world survive without Russian oil?
Could EU weaponise energy in Russia crisis?
Petrol at fresh record as oil and gas prices soar
Russia is the world's second largest gas producer and third largest oil exporter, and any move to impose sanctions on its energy industry would badly damage its own economy.
Nathan Piper, head of oil and gas research at Investec, said although imposing sanctions on Russia's oil and gas exports was attractive, ""practically it is challenging"".
He said both the global oil and gas markets were tight ahead of the war in Ukraine ""with limited spare capacity to replace any disrupted Russian volumes"".
""The question is now whether US and European leaders are prepared to endure high oil and gas prices to add energy exports to the sanctions list,"" he told the BBC.
""The threat of this action is almost the worst of both worlds, forcing prices up but doing nothing to limit Russian volumes or the revenues flowing to Moscow.""
Analysts at Capital Economics have forecast oil prices could rise to $160 a barrel if the West imposed sanctions on Russian exports, but David Oxley, senior global economist at the consultancy, told the BBC it was disruption to Russian gas that would hit countries harder, describing it as a ""completely different kettle of fish"".
He said energy intensive industries across Europe could be hit, with ""vast swathes of heavy industry being switched off"" as it is much harder finding replacement gas suppliers compared with oil.
EU countries heavily reliant on Russian gas, such as Germany, could switch from gas to coal, he said, but that would run counter to the bloc's climate ambitions and would not be a long-term solution.
The energy markets have been supremely volatile over the past week, and understandably so. There are genuine fears that supplies of oil and gas from Russia could be cut off or disrupted. 
Yet the response to Russia's suggestion it could close a major pipeline, depriving northern Europe of a large chunk of its gas supplies, has been pretty muted so far. 
There are a couple of reasons for this. Firstly, Russia is threatening a tit-for-tat embargo - cutting off its gas exports if the West goes ahead with a ban on Russian oil. 
But despite pressure from the US, such a ban is unlikely. European leaders have already poured cold water on the idea - so Russia's counter-threat carries relatively little weight. 
And then there's the fact that Russia is still making huge sums from sales of oil and gas to Europe every day, helping to fund its war.  
Moscow has everything to gain from exploiting traders' nerves to push up energy prices; but a great deal to lose if it were to carry out its threat.
Ukraine has implored the West to adopt an oil and gas ban, but there are concerns it would send prices soaring. Investor fears of an embargo drove Brent crude oil to $139 (£106) a barrel at one point on Monday - its highest level for almost 14 years.
Meanwhile, wholesale gas prices rose to 565p per therm early on Tuesday, but fell to 480p in the afternoon.
UK stock markets rose slightly in early trading after a volatile Monday caused by the US's discussions over a potential Russian oil and gas ban.
Early on Tuesday, nickel prices on the London Metal Exchange more than doubled to rise above the $100,000-a-tonne level for the first time, before trading in the metal was suspended.
Russia supplies the world with about 10% of its nickel needs, mainly for use in stainless steel and electric vehicle batteries.
Average UK petrol prices have hit a record 155p a litre
Quoting unnamed sources, Reuters news agency reported that the US might be willing to move ahead with an embargo without its allies, although it only gets about 3% of its oil from Russia.
However, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has dismissed the idea of a wider ban, saying Europe had ""deliberately exempted"" Russian energy from sanctions because its supply could not be secured ""any other way"" at the moment.
European powers have, however, committed to move away from Russian hydrocarbons over time, while some Western companies have boycotted Russian shipments or pledged to sell their stakes in Russian energy companies.
Mr Novak said that Russian companies were already feeling the pressure of US and European moves to lower the dependence on Russian energy, despite fulfilling all its contractual obligations to deliver oil and gas to Europe.
""We are concerned by the discussion and statements we are seeing regarding a possible embargo on Russian oil and petrochemicals, on phasing them out,"" he said.

Watch: Ben Wallace says visa process for refugees coming from Ukraine could be quicker
The UK needs to speed up the processing of visas for refugees fleeing the war in Ukraine, the defence secretary has said.
Ben Wallace told the BBC the government could and would do more to support refugees, and his department would help the Home Office accelerate the system.
The UK has granted visas to 300 Ukrainian refugees under its new scheme so far, the Home Office said.
It added that 17,700 applications to re-join relatives had been started.
But about 600 refugees are stuck in Calais, with many saying they were turned away for lack of paperwork.
Almost 300 people have been turned away while trying to cross to the UK, French officials told the BBC. 
Downing Street said a new visa processing site would be established in the northern French city of Lille ""in the coming days"".
When asked why it was not being set up in Calais, where Ukrainian refugees are stuck, a No 10 spokesman said the government wanted to ensure it can give the ""appropriate level of support"" refugees require.
Up until now people in Calais have been told to go to Paris to apply for their visa, with some Ukrainians telling the BBC they faced a wait of more than a week just for an appointment in the French capital.

Diane Abbott says a lack of help in Calais for Ukrainian refugees brings the UK into disrepute
The UN says that more than two million people have now fled the war in Ukraine, external - most of them to Poland.
Unlike the European Union - which is allowing Ukrainians three-year residency without a visa - the UK has retained controls on entry, with Prime Minister Boris Johnson saying it was ""sensible"" to ""have some basic ability to check who is coming in and who isn't"".
There are two main routes to a visa for refugees from the war, requiring them either to have family in the UK, or a British sponsor for their application.
After criticism from France that the UK's approach showed a ""lack of humanity"", Ms Patel said she had ""surged a Home Office team"" to help at Calais - and denied anyone had been turned back at the border.
But the BBC found a Home Office presence at a local administrative building disappeared on Monday morning, while a sign at the hostel where many refugees were staying directed them to Brussels or Paris for visa applications.
Is the UK doing enough to help refugees?
How many refugees have fled and where are they going?
Calais' sub-prefect Véronique Deprez-Boudier said that 286 Ukrainian refugees have been turned away by UK authorities so far. 
She told the BBC it is ""important to build a more organised team"" in Calais to assist them to get visas, rather than make them travel elsewhere to secure one.
The Home Office said staff have been ""surged"" at appointment centres across Europe - including in Poland, Romania, Hungary, Moldova and the Czech Republic - as well as in the UK in order to process applications as quickly as possible, while maintaining ""essential security checks"".
A spokesperson said the UK stands ""shoulder-to-shoulder"" with the Ukrainian people and it was ""working at pace to process applications as quickly as possible"".
Ukraine has begun evacuating civilians from the town of Irpin, near the capital Kyiv, and the northern city of Sumy after Russian and Ukrainian officials agreed to set up humanitarian corridors.
But on Tuesday, Ukrainian officials said Russian forces were shelling an evacuation route out of the besieged southern city of Mariupol.
Ukrainian cities have continued to suffer heavy bombardment from Russian forces, causing several civilian evacuation plans to collapse.

Speaking to BBC Breakfast, the defence secretary said the UK's visa scheme for Ukrainian refugees was ""generous"" but conceded ""we can... and will do more"".
Insisting the ""vast"" scheme would allow hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians to enter the UK, he said: ""It's not the case that we are only allowing 300 people in... the system has not been quick enough, which is what we're going to address.""
Challenged on the 600 Ukrainians stuck in Calais and whether visas should be processed there, Mr Wallace insisted he was ""not the home secretary"" and the detail on how to process the visas was a matter for Ms Patel's department.
He said she was ""determined"" to speed up the process and - revealing his department has offered to help - added: ""we'll all lean in to help the Home Office deliver that"".
Mr Wallace also said the UK will increase its ""lethal and non-lethal aid"" to Ukraine and he will set out further details in a statement MPs on Wednesday.
Meanwhile, Justice Secretary Dominic Raab will travel to the Hague to help an international effort to gather evidence on Russian war crimes in Ukraine, the foreign secretary told MPs on Tuesday.
'No-one can help us here'
By Mark Easton, BBC home editor in Calais
The Raminishvili family are stuck in Calais
Misha Raminishvili was close to despair, his daughter in tears, as the news came through. 
""No visa for at least another week,"" he said, simply. ""No-one can help us in Calais.""
I met Misha, with his Ukrainian wife Maria and two children, at a hostel in the French port which is accommodating 137 Ukrainian refugees.
Misha has a house in Hornchurch, east London, but lives between there and Kyiv.
He and his son, Misha Jr, have UK passports. But his wife Maria, and daughter Gabrielle, do not - and therefore need visas to enter the UK, which require biometric checks.
Misha has been stuck in Calais for five days, unable to get his family across the Channel, in what would be the last leg of a journey that began on 24 February.

The Home Office repeated its claim that it was the first visa scheme to launch since the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
Since the Ukraine Family Scheme launched on 4 March, 8,900 applications have been submitted, while 4,300 applicants have made appointments to submit their biometric details.
Of these, 640 applications have been confirmed, the Home Office said, and 300 visas have been issued so far.
Refugee and migrant rights director Steve Valdez-Symonds said the Home Office was ""once again too slow and too bureaucratic in response to a refugee crisis that almost everyone saw coming"".
Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the government should be offering a ""simple route to sanctuary"" for people in danger, and said the Home Office is ""in a complete mess"".

Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Tuesday morning.
1. Vaccines not linked to deaths, study finds
There is no link between Pfizer and Moderna Covid vaccines and deaths that were recorded after people had their jabs, according to a major study. The US research looked at the side effects of the jab and found no unusual patterns in death rates.
2. Brain changes
Significant differences to the brain before and after a Covid infection have been found by scientists. MRI scans showed that catching the virus, even a mild form, had shrunk the size of the organ slightly, with less grey matter in the parts related to smell and memory. It's not known if the change is permanent but the brain can heal.
3. US governor kidnapping plot trial
A trial of four men accused of plotting to kidnap Michigan's Democratic governor Gretchen Whitmer over Covid rules she imposed is due to begin. The alleged plot was foiled by the FBI 17 months ago and involves four men. The jury is being selected later for the trial, in the city of Grand Rapids, which is expected to last about six weeks.
4. A healthcare system revival in India?
The first wave of Covid in India ""was about saving lives with minimal resources,"" says Dr Sangram Kapale. Since then the Indian government has ramped up its spending on healthcare and there's hope the devastating impact of the pandemic was a turning point, with a future focus on technology and innovation. So, can technology help revive India's health system? Find out here.
5. Covid 'created understanding'
Caitlin Rich has cystic fibrosis - an incurable condition that causes a build-up of thick sticky mucus in the lungs, digestive system and other organs. Before the pandemic she would often self-isolate over fears of catching infections. The 25-year-old, from Derbyshire, says the requirement for millions to self-isolate during the pandemic now means more people can relate to her everyday life Here's her story.

Diets based on juiced fruit and vegetables are high in vitamins but often low in calories, protein and fibre
Shane Warne, who died from natural causes on Friday, had reportedly been on a liquid diet for 14 days - to try to lose weight quickly. 
Days before he died, he tweeted an old photo, saying, external: ""The goal by July is to get back to this shape from a few years ago.""
Friends have said it was a regime he had tried several times before, although there is no evidence it was linked to his sudden death.
So how safe are these diets and what is their effect on the body?
There are many different kinds of liquid diets but they all have the same aim - to lose weight quickly by eating fewer calories.
They range from fashionable fruit and vegetable juice drinks that promise to detox and cleanse the body to low-calorie shakes and soups.
But experts warn these extreme diets carry health risks and are unsuitable for most people.

The NHS recommends its 800-calories-a-day diet for certain groups only, particularly obese or severely obese people managing type-2 diabetes.
Tried and tested, it comes with lots of support and medical supervision, and contains all the daily nutrients needed - but this is seldom the case with other liquid diets found online.
""Juice diets appeal to people because they want a quick fix - but dieting is really hard,"" Aisling Pigott, of the British Dietetic Association, says.
""There is a role for them - but it's not one size fits all.
""It's concerning when they are marketed at people who are a healthy weight.""

Fruit and vegetable juice provides lots of minerals and vitamins - but very little protein or fat.
Even fibre would be in short supply unless the whole fruit, including the skin and seeds, was pulped and added.
""You'd feel drained and exhausted after a week,"" Dr Gail Rees, associate professor of human nutrition, at the University of Plymouth, says.
A diet that is not nutritionally balanced is not giving the body everything it needs - and ""could be very damaging"" in the long term.
Iron reserves would be used up, which could lead to anaemia in women, muscle mass would be depleted and the gut, lungs and liver would have to work harder to keep the body functioning normally.
Other potential side-effects include headaches, dizziness, extreme tiredness, diarrhoea or constipation.
Fruit juices, which contain lots of naturals acids, can also wear away enamel on teeth and a lack of calorie intake can make breath smell different.
Losing weight quickly is possible on a liquid diet but the biggest challenge, according to Ms Pigott, is ""yo-yo risk"" - the danger of piling weight back on again when food intake returns to normal.
Fad diets are ""part of a toxic diet culture"" encouraging negative attitudes to food and often leading to weight gain not loss, she says.
And she recommends listening to your own body, going back to basics and setting achievable goals that work in the long term, not just for a week.
'Weight cycling'
""Extreme diets are not a sustainable solution for losing weight in the long term, as much of the weight that is lost is likely to be water or lean muscle,"" Dr Simon Steenson, of the British Nutrition Foundation, says.
""These types of crash diets may also lead to some health risks as well, such as a higher risk of developing gall stones.""
Dr Steenson also warns of ""weight cycling"" - a pattern of losing and regaining weight with fad diets - which can have negative health effects itself.
A better option to lose weight, he says, is to aim for a varied and balanced diet, including lots of fruit, vegetables, wholegrains, beans, nuts and seeds, plus finding ways to be active throughout the day.
Dr Rees recommends removing alcohol, crisps, biscuits and takeaway food from your diet, which are all supplying unwanted calories, rather than focusing on a quick ""liquid diet"" fix.
And if you have any underlying health conditions, always check with a GP or dietitian before starting a diet.
Carried out in the right way, liquid diets - such as the low-calorie NHS programmes for the overweight - are proven to work, but for many people, they can be very difficult to follow and may be unnecessarily risky.

Plus Anthony Joshua announces new trainer and Amir Khan reportedly wants a rematch with Kell Brook. It's Fight Talk.,"Fight Talk: Will Tyson Fury retire after Dillian Whyte fight or is he on a wind-up?
In this week's Fight Talk, Tyson Fury says he will retire from boxing following the upcoming heavyweight clash with Dillian Whyte in April. But will the WBC champion actually hang up his gloves? 
Also, after months of speculation, Anthony Joshua confirms his new head trainer and will Amir Khan invoke his rematch clause against Kell Brook after the one-sided nature of their clash last month?
Here's your weekly fix of boxing news.
Fury's Farewell Fight?
British heavyweight champion Tyson Fury has said he will soon retire from boxing, claiming he has more money than he will ever need. 
'The Gypsy King' is set to face Dillian Whyte at Wembley on 23 April.
Fury, a two-time heavyweight champion, has caused quite a stir with these comments and while some understand his reasoning, many fight fans don't think he will actually go through it. 
Here's how social media reacted.
Fury can be considered a bit of a wind-up merchant - and Matchroom Boxing promoter Eddie Hearn has suggested he's not falling for it. 
""If you believe anything Tyson Fury says, you're absolutely mad,"" Hearn said.  
There are huge potential fights out there for Fury should he overcome Whyte. 
The undefeated champion could fight Oleksandr Usyk in an undisputed clash or be involved in an all-British super fight against Anthony Joshua.
Fury has also welcomed a crossover fight with UFC heavyweight champion Francis Ngannou next year. 
""I don't class that as a real boxing fight. That's going to be a special fight,"" he told The MMA Hour. ""That will be in a cage with 4oz gloves in Las Vegas at the Raiders Stadium.""
Where do you stand? Will Fury's fight against Whyte be the last time we see him in a competitive boxing bout? Are you interested in seeing a fight between Fury and Ngannou? 
Get involved on social media using #bbcboxing.
Joshua announces new coach
Anthony Joshua has confirmed his new head trainer as the heavyweight prepares for a rematch against Usyk.
""I'm working with Angel Fernandez,"" Joshua told Boxing Social. 
""Full time, video analysis, tactician, pad man, sparring, dietician, strength and conditioning, cardio. You know what I'm saying like? Yeah."" 
Since losing to Usyk in London last September, 'AJ' has spent time in America in various boxing gyms linking up with renowned coaches including Eddy Reynoso, Virgil Hunter, and Ronnie Shields.
However, the 2012 Olympic gold medallist now seems set to remain in Britain with London-based coach Fernandez. 
Here's how boxing fans reacted on social media.
What do you make of Joshua's new appointment? Let us know on social media using #bbcboxing.
Khan v Brook II?
The general consensus late on Saturday 19 February was that Amir Khan's time as a boxer was well and truly over. 
The Bolton man was outclassed by rival Kell Brook in Manchester and looked a shadow of his former self.
Khan, 35, is a former unified light-welterweight world champion and hinted in the post-fight media conference that his time was up. 
""I need to sit down with my family, but it is more towards the end of my career,"" Khan said after the loss. ""The love of the sport isn't there anymore. That is a sign for me that I should maybe be calling it a day."" 
But in a somewhat unexpected turnaround, Khan could be set to invoke his rematch clause against Brook.
""I think the word on the street is true - Amir Khan doesn't want to call it a day,"" Boxxer promoter Ben Shalom told Sky Sports. 
""I can't see it, but Amir is convinced. We'll hear his reasons in the next few days and we'll have to take it from there."" 
Khan meanwhile posted this cryptic message on Twitter.

Sheffield's Brook responded to the news that Khan could be willing to fight again by telling Sky Sports: ""If he wants another whooping, he can have another whooping."" 
Given how one-sided the first fight was, many boxing fans do not believe a rematch is needed.
Will a rematch between the two rivals pique your interest? Can you see the result turning out any differently? Let us know on social media using the hashtag #bbcboxing.

Scorecard
Alyssa Healy helped Australia secure a comfortable seven-wicket win against Pakistan at the Women's World Cup. 
Australia put their opponents into bat after winning the toss and Pakistan, with the help of 78 from Bismah Maroof, reached a modest 190-6.
Healy opened the batting for her side and scored 72 off 79 balls.
Rachael Haynes and Meg Lanning added 34 and 35 respectively as Australia, who beat England in their opening game, won with 15.2 overs remaining.
It was a second victory in a row for captain Lanning's side, while Pakistan, who were beaten by India in their first game, have yet to win at the tournament.
""Everyone's in really good form, we all got starts and I guess we're all feeling in good nick,"" Lanning said.
""Pakistan did extremely well and made it hard for us to take wickets so we were disciplined and kept that run rate in check."" 
Pakistan's next game will be against South Africa on 11 March, with Australia playing hosts New Zealand a day later.

Watch: US bans all Russian oil and gas imports
The US and UK are banning Russian oil and the EU is ending its reliance on Russian gas, stepping up the economic response to the invasion of Ukraine.
US President Joe Biden said the move targeted ""the main artery of Russia's economy"". 
Energy exports are a vital source of revenue for Russia but the move is also likely to impact Western consumers.  
Major brands have meanwhile continued to pull out of Russia, with McDonald's and Coca-Cola the latest to leave. 
Russia's economy is heavily dependent on energy. It is the world's third-biggest oil producer, behind Saudi Arabia and the US.
Before the measures were announced, Russia warned of ""catastrophic"" consequences for the global economy and said it might close its main gas pipeline to Germany.
On the ground in Ukraine, civilians have been evacuated from two under-attack areas while the US has said up to 4,000 Russian troops may have been killed in the conflict.  
The conflict has already sent petrol prices to record highs in the US and the UK and experts warn they could go even higher.
However, Venezuela could increase its oil production to help replace Russian oil.
Reinaldo Quintero, president of the association that represents Venezuelan oil companies told the BBC that the country could potentially raise its production levels by 400,000 barrels a day.
""I think we can reach 1.2 million barrels per day with the infrastructure we have right now at this moment. So that will make us able to supply the need, some of the need, to the North American market,"" he said.
Russian oil 'no longer acceptable'
President Biden's announcement followed pressure from both sides of the US political divide to do more to target the Russian economy. 
""We're banning all imports of Russian oil and gas and energy,"" he said. 
""That means Russian oil will no longer be acceptable at US ports and the American people will deal another powerful blow to [President Vladimir] Putin.""
Mr Biden admitted the move was ""not without cost at home,"" adding the decision was taken ""in close consultation"" with allies. 
In a similar move, the UK is to phase out Russian oil imports by the end of 2022.
Could the world survive without Russian oil and gas?
EU unveils plan to end reliance on Russian gas
The UK Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, accepted that the move would not hit Russia immediately but added ""what it will do is add to the pressure we're already seeing on Russia and don't forget that the economic impact of the sanctions that the UK has led has been extreme"". 
About 8% of US oil and refined product imports come from Russia, while Russia makes up about 6% of the UK's oil imports.
By contrast, the EU is much more reliant on Russian energy, so the bloc's response stopped short of a ban. 
The European Commission said it would switch to alternative supplies and expand clean energy faster to fill the shortfall, with the aim of making Europe independent from Russian fossil fuels ""well before 2030"".

Watch: Five times Russians have stood up for Ukraine
""We're not standing here to say this is going to be in any way easy,"" said the European Commission's Vice-President Frans Timmermans. 
""But I am also deeply convinced that even if it's not easy, even if it's very hard, it's something we need to do, because now it's also intimately linked to our security.""
Russia later announced plans to ban the exports of certain commodities and raw materials. The details are still to be worked out, but Russia is a major exporter of grain and metals. 
Even countries with low Russian energy imports are set to feel the impact as the measures are likely to boost already high wholesale prices. Inflation is soaring in the US, EU and the UK, adding to the pressure on households. 
The move adds to a long list of economic sanctions imposed against Russia following its invasion of Ukraine - the central bank has had its assets frozen, some Russian banks have been cut off from global payment networks and Germany suspended the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which would have transported more gas from Russia to Germany.
But energy sales have continued to provide a source of cash despite the other financial restrictions.

166,166,War in Ukraine: Troops dig in near Kyiv,"Wed, 09 Mar 2022 00:00:25 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-60671329,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-60671329?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,Ukrainians are determined to defend their capital city as Russian troops prepare for an assault.,"War in Ukraine: Troops dig in near Kyiv
""We're here to destroy the enemy brigades,"" says Johnny Dragan (left)
The commander called himself Johnny Dragan, and he smoked each cigarette as fiercely as if it was going to be his last. 
Dragan was strengthening a blocking position at a strategic crossroads north-west of Kyiv. If the Russians broke through, Dragan and his men would have to stop them. Behind him was a dual carriageway heading straight to Kyiv. 
Off-duty soldiers were eating and resting at a restaurant on the crossroads that Dragan had taken over as his headquarters. The food was hearty, and they stacked their rifles in neat conical piles next to their tables.
Outside, the active shift was working during another bitterly cold day, with the snow settling on their shoulders. A tank was in position. A deadly-looking artillery piece was positioned to fire directly, over open sights, at anything coming down the road that Dragan decided was a threat. 
""We're here to destroy the enemy brigades,"" he said. ""The occupiers who've come to our country - and are heading our way."" 
A builder's lorry was lowering slabs of reinforced concrete with the crane it had used until a fortnight or so back to deliver housebuilding supplies. Destruction not construction has been happening since. It felt more urgent near the frontline today. Ukrainian troops inside and outside Kyiv are reinforcing checkpoints into barricades.
Dragan's men were close to Hostomel, a small and strategically important town. Fighting has not stopped there since the first morning of the war, when Russia airborne troops came in by helicopter to seize a cargo airport as a bridgehead. 
Tanya says Hostomel ""used to be such a lovely place to live"" but now there is ""no house, no street and no town""
We picked up Tanya and Ivan, a couple in their 60s who had been walking for three hours to get out of Hostomel. It took 13 days, they said, to gather the courage to leave their freezing cellar. 
Tanya described what they had seen on the first day of the war before they fled underground. ""When our guys blew up the bridge, we saw tanks and a car with the soldiers ahead of the column, but our guys did not let them go… The bridge was blown up and the car and everything was destroyed.""
When they emerged at dawn after nearly two terrifying weeks to walk towards Kyiv, about 20 miles (32km) away, everything had changed. Tanya wept a little as she remembered how it had been in Hostomel. ""It used to be such a lovely place to live. But when we came up this morning there was no house, no street and no town."" 
Some destroyed buildings north-west of Kyiv are still smouldering
Many villages nearby, not just their home, are in ruins. 
In buildings that are still burning a few traces of old lives are left; smouldering kitchens where families must have eaten, argued and loved. Dogs scavenge for food, waiting close to the rubble for owners who abandoned them. 
Russian tactical and military blunders, plus well-organised and determined resistance, have bought the Ukrainians time to beef up for whatever comes next. That is not going to last indefinitely. 
The barrage of international sanctions against Russia shows no sign of forcing President Vladimir Putin to change his mind. His public utterances reinforce what seems to be his determination to finish the job of crushing Ukrainian independence, which he tells the Russian people is a necessary step to protect themselves and their nation. 
It is hard to overstate the gravity of the crisis caused by the invasion, and the years of tension that led to it. It is deadly serious because of Russia and the  Nato countries' radically different views of the security and orientation of states that used to be firmly in the orbit of the Soviet Union. 
The parties to the wider conflict, above and beyond the war in Ukraine, are armed with nuclear weapons that could destroy all of us. The chances that this war could somehow go nuclear are very low, despite Mr Putin's decision to increase the level of readiness of part of his arsenal. 
But wars generate confusion and misperception, and the dangers of escalation are ever-present. 
A local hospital that has been treating the wounded Ukrainian soldiers is being abandoned
Like most people who grew up in the Cold War, I cannot forget the relief I felt when it ended, and the joy of turning on the television on 9 November 1989 and seeing Germans dancing on the Berlin Wall. 
It is hard to believe that more than 30 years later I have spent the day reporting on the Russian push into Ukraine, and the results of a failure by all concerned to build security that would stop Europe going back to its old ways. 
A couple of miles from the Russians in Hostomel, Ukrainians were preparing to abandon a hospital that has been treating the wounded. They had been evacuated further away from the fighting, and the hospital director Dr Valerii Zukin was supervising staff wrapping sensitive medical equipment with bales of clingfilm. Beds were waiting to be picked up and trucked out. 
My ship is sinking, Dr Zukin told me, and I am the captain so I will be the last to leave. 
His voice rose as he said Ukrainians did not want food aid. Instead, they wanted weapons and a no-fly zone enforced by Nato.
""The Russians understand only the language of the power. I would like to use the words of the former Prime Minister of Israel, Golda Meir, who said it was impossible to negotiate with the man who came to kill you.""
It was a lonely and tense drive through the snow until we saw the suburbs of Kyiv. Ukrainian troops were dug into the woods, waiting.

Consumer giants including McDonald's, Coca-Cola and Starbucks have joined the list of firms halting business in Russia due to the invasion of Ukraine.
McDonald's said it was temporarily closing its roughly 850 restaurants in Russia, while Starbucks also said its 100 coffee shops would shut.
On Wednesday, Heineken stopped beer production and sales in Russia.
And Mothercare said all business in Russia, which represents 20% to 25% of its global sales, had been stopped. 
Elsewhere, tobacco company Imperial Brands - the group behind brands including JPS and Davidoff cigarettes - said it was pausing production at its factory in Volgograd in a move impacting about 1,000 employees. 
It has already suspended its operations in Ukraine over staff safety concerns.
Russia and Ukraine together accounted for 2% of Imperial's net revenues last year - about £656m.
Meanwhile, British American Tobacco has halted investment in Russia, but said its business in the country continues to operate. 
The moves by McDonald's, Coca-Cola and Starbucks come after mounting pressure on companies to act over the war in Ukraine. All three firms said they would continue to pay their staff.
Anna MacDonald, a fund manager at Amati Global Investors, told the BBC Radio 4 Today Programme that firms who were joining the wave of firms leaving Russia were doing so because ""shareholders and wider stakeholders wouldn't stand for continued generation of revenues and profits"" from the country,
""It was affecting their share prices and the feeling was that it was just utterly inappropriate to continue to do so,"" she said.

McDonald's established a presence in Moscow in 1990 as the Soviet Union was opening its economy, and it drew thousands for its burgers and fries. Its closure now carries similar symbolic weight, and could influence other firms.
However, fast-food chain rival Burger King is currently keeping its Russian stores open. It committed $3m (£2.3m) to support Ukrainian refugees and said people fleeing to European nations could get free Whopper meal vouchers.
Restaurant Brands International, which owns Burger King, said it would redirect its profits from more than 800 franchised operations in Russia to humanitarian efforts.
The company told the BBC its Russian outlets were operated by franchisees with which it had ""long-standing legal agreements"" that were not easy to change currently.
McDonald's chief executive Chris Kempczinski said it was ""impossible to predict"" when it would reopen in Russia.
McDonalds has also temporarily closed its 108 restaurants in Ukraine.
Collectively the countries account for about 9% of the firm's revenue and about 2% of global sales.
Companies have been under pressure to act as Russian violence against civilians has escalated.
#BoycottMcDonalds and #BoycottCocaCola had both been trending on Twitter over recent days.
Dozens of well-known firms including Netflix and Levi's have already suspended sales or stopped providing services in Russia amid severe sanctions imposed by Western allies.
Coca-Cola on Tuesday said it was suspending operations in Russia, which accounted for roughly 2% of the firm's operating revenue and income. It also has a roughly 20% ownership stake in a bottling and distribution business in Russia. 
""Our hearts are with the people who are enduring unconscionable effects from these tragic events in Ukraine,"" the company said.
Pepsi, which has a much larger presence in Russia than rival Coca-Cola, said it was halting the production and sale of Pepsi and other global brands in Russia and suspending capital investments and advertising, citing ""horrific events"" in Ukraine.
But the company, which started operating in Russia during the Cold War and now employs 20,000 people there, said it would continue to offer other products.
""As a food and beverage company, now more than ever we must stay true to the humanitarian aspect of our business,"" boss Ramon Laguarta said. ""That means we have a responsibility to continue to offer our other products in Russia, including daily essentials such as milk and other dairy offerings, baby formula and baby food.""
Starbucks' plans to stop business in Russia include stopping shipments of its products. 
The coffee chain's licensee in the country Kuwait-based Alshaya Group will continue to pay its roughly 2,000 staff members.
Growing backlash
Other major global brands joining the backlash on Tuesday included the world's largest music company, Universal Music Group, which said it was suspending all operations in Russia and closing its offices there.
Unilever, maker of Marmite, Dove beauty products and PG Tips, among other brands, also said it had suspended trade with Russia and planned to halt its advertising and media spending and investment in the country.
It said it would continue to supply ""everyday essential food and hygiene products"" that are made in Russia.
L'Oreal, the world's biggest cosmetics company, is also shutting its stores and concessions in Russia and suspending online sales.
In response to the number of firms packing up, Russia has warned that it may nationalise production plants or factories where work has temporarily been suspended. 
Andrei Turchak, secretary of the ruling United Russia party's general council, said on Monday evening: ""United Russia proposes nationalising production plants of the companies that announce their exit and the closure of production in Russia"", during what he described as a ""special operation"" in Ukraine.
Some firms have also defended plans to continue operating in Russia, including Uniqlo owner Fast Retailing, whose founder told Japan's Nikkei newspaper that ""clothing is a necessity of life"".

169,169,War in Ukraine: Warning oil sanctions will further hit UK living costs,"Wed, 09 Mar 2022 01:29:26 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-60670120,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-60670120?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,"Plans to ban or curb Russian oil and gas imports will further hit UK living standards, analysts say.","Ukraine war: Cost of filling diesel family car hits record £90
The cost of filling an average family car with diesel has topped £90 for the first time, as soaring oil prices hit household budgets.
The RAC motoring group said the average price of a litre of diesel rose 3p overnight to a record 165.24p - the biggest daily jump since 2000.
Tuesday's oil embargo on Russia for invading Ukraine has left governments searching for alternative supplies.
The UK gets 8% of its oil imports from Russia, but about 18% of its diesel.
A litre of petrol was now 158.2p, a 2p rise, the RAC said.
The latest jump in pump prices is likely to have been pushed higher by soaring wholesale costs before Tuesday's announcement that the UK intends to phase out its imports by the end of 2020. 
A barrel of crude oil rose 1.3% on Wednesday, and experts say this will feed through into still higher retail prices.
RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said: ""The diesel daily increase was the second largest on record since 2000.
""The cost of a filling a 55-litre family car with petrol is now £87 - £7 more than it was at the start of the year. Diesel drivers are even worse off with a tank now costing more than £90 for the first time ever - £8 more than in early January.""
And he warned of more pain at the pump: ""Petrol is now certain to top an average of £1.60 a litre this week while diesel will progress very quickly towards £1.70.""
The US said on Tuesday it would immediately ban Russian oil and gas, and the EU vowed to cut is gas imports by two thirds this year.
Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng tweeted that the UK's transition would give its ""market, businesses and supply chains more than enough time to replace Russian imports"".

Robert Buckley, an energy analyst at Cornwall Insight, told the BBC the UK ban was ""largely symbolic"" because Russian oil was such a small part of its overall energy mix. 
However, together with the US ban, and widespread boycotts by western companies, the move is likely to increase already high oil prices in the coming weeks, he said.
""This is a global market and you've got to replace that displaced supply somehow,"" Mr Buckley told the BBC. 
""At the margin, this decision will act to support oil prices which are already extremely high.""
Surging pump prices
The price of Brent crude - the global oil benchmark - has climbed for weeks, hitting a 14-year high of $139 a barrel at one point on Monday. Prices jumped 7% on Tuesday after the sanctions were announced.

West hits Russia with oil bans and gas curbs 
Higher energy bills 'almost inevitable' says Ofgem
Western governments are trying to find alternative supplies and looking at how to increase output. This includes possible deals to unlock supplies from Iran or Venezuela - both of which face their own oil sanctions. However, talks are reportedly making very slow progress. 
Russia, the Netherlands, and Saudi Arabia were largest sources of road diesel in 2020, according to the latest Digest of UK Energy Statistics, external (Dukes). The three countries accounted for 62% of total road diesel imports in 2020.
The annual report also pointed out that the UK is one of the largest importers of diesel in the OECD group of biggest economies.
Mr Kwarteng told the Commons on Wednesday that a taskforce of officials and business would look into how the transition to alternative supplies could be implemented without hurting consumers. He said the taskforce would work with the US and Gulf states.
He said: ""Working with industry, we are confident that this can be achieved over the course of the year, providing enough time for companies to adjust and ensuring consumers are protected.""
The business secretary also said there should be more investment in North Sea oil and gas fields. 
However, he declined to commit to restarting fracking for gas in the UK, as some MPs in the Conservative Party have called for. Instead, he echoed earlier comments by Prime Minister Boris Johnson that the government would look at all options.
'Fuel poverty'
Even before Russia invaded Ukraine, the UK's cost of living was rising at its fastest rate in 30 years amid surging global demand for oil and gas as pandemic restrictions eased. 
But the war has added to this pressure, driving up the cost of not just fuel and energy but also other commodities like wheat and metals.
Food prices are rising
Nathan Piper, an oil and gas analyst at Investec, said the EU's decision on Tuesday to reduce its reliance on Russian gas was also likely to hit the UK.
Wholesale gas prices have been climbing for months and analysts expect the UK's energy price cap - which limits what consumers pay for gas and electricity - to rise to more than £3,000 a year for the average household when it is next reviewed in October. 
""We are on the cusp of a prolonged period of high oil and gas prices, possibly lasting several years,"" Mr Piper told the BBC. 
""You can't just cut the second largest gas producer and third largest oil producer out of global supply and not expect it to have big impact on consumers,"" he added.
He said there would be ""extreme fuel poverty"" over the next few years, with the government facing growing pressure to offer more support. 
In research published on Tuesday, external, the Centre for Business and Economic Research (CEBR) warned that a combination of rising commodity and oil prices and sanctions was likely to have major impact on the UK economy.
It estimates that GDP growth this year will be more than halved - down from a previously forecast 4.2% to 1.9%.

President Zelensky: We will not give up, and we will not lose, we will fight to the end... whatever the cost
Volodymyr Zelensky has invoked the words of Britain's wartime leader Winston Churchill as he appealed to MPs for more help at home.
The Ukrainian president spoke to the Commons via video, thanking the UK for its support since Russia's invasion, and receiving a standing ovation.
But he called for Russia to be named a ""terrorist state"" and for allies to ""make sure our skies are safe"".
""We will not surrender, we will not lose, we will go to the end,"" he added. 
Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the leader had ""moved the hearts of everybody"" watching, and pledged to ""press on with tightening the economic vice"" around Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer also praised ""the bravery [and] the resolve"" of the president and his people, adding: ""He has shown his strength and we must show him - and the Ukrainian people - our commitment and support.""

UK to boost lethal and non-lethal Ukraine aid
Speaking to MPs and peers in the Commons, President Zelensky gave a day-by-day account of the invasion by Russia, which began a fortnight ago. 
He described how it was a war Ukraine ""didn't start and we didn't want"", but his country now had to fight.
""We do not want to lose what we have, what is ours... just the same way as you once didn't want to lose your country when the Nazis started to fight your country and you had to fight for Britain,"" he added. 
The president also spoke of the 50 children ""that could have lived"" but were killed by Russian forces, along with those of his people dying from dehydration where their cities had been blockaded by Russia.
MPs and peers gathered in the Commons to listen to the address through headsets and watch the president on large screens
In a nod to one of former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill's famous speeches from 1940, the president said he wanted to ""remind you of the words Britain heard already, which become current again"".
He said: ""We will not surrender, we will not lose, we will go to the end.
""We will fight at sea, we will fight in the air, we will protect our land. 
""We will fight everywhere… and we will not surrender.""
He also turned to a William Shakespeare quote in his address. 
""To be or not to be,"" said President Zelensky. ""You know the Shakespeare question very well.
""Thirteen days and that question still could have applied to Ukraine. 
""But now, already, it is obvious it is 'to be' - it is obvious it is to be free."" 
'Make our skies safe'
Alongside his British cultural references, President Zelensky also hinted towards his previous appeal for a no-fly zone over Ukraine, saying: ""We still have the sky open, it is still open to Russian missiles planes and helicopters.""
He also called for allies to ""strengthen the sanctions against the terrorist state [Russia], finally classify it as a terrorist state [and] find a way to make our Ukrainian skies safe"". 
The leader concluded his speech by saying: ""Do what you can, do what you must, because greatness obliges greatness, of your state and your people.
""Glory to Ukraine and glory to Great Britain.""
MPs crammed into every corner. Members of the House of Lords packed the public galleries high in the chamber. Parliamentary staff huddled close to peer through the stone arches, almost in the roof, to watch.
After a few minutes of chatter, with MPs fiddling with their headsets to ensure they would be able to hear the translation of the speech, there was hush. 
Then alone at his desk, only a Ukrainian flag for company, President Volodymyr Zelensky appeared on screens to speak to MPs and, of course, to the country.
Ukraine's leader told of his country's pain as each day, a war ""we did not start"" progressed. Bombs falling on schools. Churches destroyed. Children's hospitals attacked. Food and water running low in some parts.
He thanked the UK for its support, urging the government to tighten sanctions still further, to protect Ukraine's skies, even though enforcing a no-fly zone is a step - a risk - that the UK and its allies just aren't willing to take yet.
Yet the message that brought tears to some MPs' eyes was Mr Zelenksy's utter defiance.

Leaders of the main political parties in the Commons then made speeches to praise President Zelensky's efforts against the Russian Invasion.
Mr Johnson said: ""At this moment, ordinary Ukrainians are defending their homes and their families against a brutal assault, and they are by their actions inspiring millions with their courage and their devotion.
""And I think today, one of the proudest boasts in the free world is, 'Ya Ukrainets' - 'I am a Ukrainian'.""
Sir Keir added: ""Invading troops march through [President Zelensky's] streets, shells reign down on his people, and assassins seek his life.
""No-one would have blamed him for fleeing. But instead, he has stayed in Kyiv to lead the Ukrainian people and to fight.
""Labour stands with President Zelensky, with Ukraine, with democracy. Slava Ukraini.""
SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford also said he saluted the Ukrainian leader, adding: ""We stand with the people of Ukraine on the basis of the act of aggression, on the act of war of Putin.
""We must do all that we can to send support to Ukraine, to send the weapons that they need to defend themselves, to make sure that we sanction the regime in Moscow, that we deliver the clearest message to President Putin - that this will end in failure for him, that he will face justice at the international court.""

The UK has made it a criminal offence for planes owned or chartered by Russians to enter UK airspace
A private jet has been impounded at Farnborough Airport in Hampshire as authorities investigate its connection with a billionaire Russian oligarch.
The jet flew into the country last Thursday and UK officials believe oil tycoon Eugene Shvidler was on board.
They are now investigating whether the plane is permanently leased to Mr Shvidler and falls under UK sanctions. 
The Luxembourg-registered jet was due to take off from the UK to Dubai, but officials have now prevented this.
It comes as the UK announced new sanctions on Russian aircraft.
Ministers are making it a criminal offence for planes owned or chartered by Russians to enter UK airspace, and new trade sanctions will prevent all UK exports of aviation or space-related technology to Russia.
Mr Shvidler has himself not been personally sanctioned by the UK at any stage.

Who are the mega-rich Russians facing sanctions?
Announcing the new measures, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said the changes would inflict further ""economic pain on Russia and those close to the Kremlin"".
She added the government would continue to support Ukraine and ""work to isolate Russia on the international stage"".
Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said the UK was ""one of the first countries to ban Russian aircraft and today we are going even further by making it a criminal offence for Russian aircraft to operate in UK airspace"".  
""We will always work to deny [Russian President Vladimir] Putin and his cronies the right to continue as normal while innocent Ukrainians suffer.""
Nick Watt, political editor of BBC Two's Newsnight, said the measures would address the ""grey area"" of private jets that are registered in a third country being chartered by wealthy Russians.
Sources told Newsnight that identifying a plane as Russian is not just a matter of following it on a radar, but about ""detective work"" to establish its true origins. 
The new sanctions come shortly after the UK government confirmed it would introduce a ban on all Russian oil by the end of the year, with a similar move announced by the US..

Pasha Lee was a rising star on Ukrainian TV but was already well known on the big screen there
Talented Ukrainian actor and TV presenter Pasha Lee has been killed in battle as Russian forces bombarded the town of Irpin outside the capital Kyiv.
Lee, 33, had signed up for Ukraine's territorial defence force in the first days of the war.
A resident of Irpin, he appeared in several films and his voice featured in the Ukrainian versions of The Lion King and The Hobbit.
He is one of a number of public figures killed in the Russian invasion.
Investigative journalist Viktor Dudar was killed on the front line during a battle with Russian troops near the southern city of Mykolaiv, Ukrainian reports said.
Pavlo Li, as the actor was formally known, was born in Crimea in 1988 and had recently begun presenting a show on Dom TV, a Ukrainian channel originally aimed at audiences in the eastern areas seized by Russian-backed separatists in 2014.
Channel head Yulia Ostrovska told Ukraine's national union of journalists that he was the ""most cheerful and sunny"" of the presenters on the show.
Lee starred in TV talent shows Star Factory and X-Factor as well as a number of films including the 2016 release SelfieParty, involving four students who wake up in a police station after a night on the town, unaware of how they got there.
As a young actor in 2006 he starred in a teen-horror movie called The Pit but more recently featured in the comedy Meeting of Classmates.
Irpin, the town 20km (12 miles) north-west of Kyiv where he lived, has been bombarded for days by Russian artillery, with shocking scenes of death, destruction and families rushing to escape.
Residents of Irpin have been fleeing the Russian assault on their city, which is half an hour's drive from Kyiv
Residents were able to get out of Irpin as well as the north-eastern city of Sumy on Tuesday as part of a Russian evacuation corridor, heading for the central city of Poltava.
Civilians evacuated from two areas under attack
Days before Pasha Lee was killed he posted a link to a Ukrainian refugee charity, urging people either to approach them for help or to volunteer. 
In his final Instagram post he posted a photo showing him and a colleague with the cheerful message that they were smiling because ""we'll be ok and everything will be Ukraine"".

The number of children missing at least half of school is also greater than previously thought, at 122,000. 
The figures are based on information gathered from 145 councils for the Children's Commissioner. 
Dame Rachel de Souza said urgent action was needed to identify the children most at risk, and the reasons why they miss school. 
The investigation follows concerns some pupils have never fully returned to lessons after national lockdowns during the Covid pandemic. 
It also found no reliable figures for children who never go to school at all, raising the prospects of a small, but vulnerable group of children who are entirely out of sight, and thus impossible for the authorities to keep safe. 
Dame Rachel said: ""I'm extremely concerned, I'm surprised at the size of it.
""I'm worried about children missing education but also safeguarding and helping those who most need to be back at school to be back.""
Unique identifier
She said thought needs to be given about how to make sure children under the age of 18 don't fall through the gaps between school and social services. 
""I'm very keen we start to work with a unique identifer for children, that could be the NHS number or one of the other numbers that already exist."" 
The latest estimates suggest persistent absence from school - missing more than 10% - is at a rate almost twice as high as before the pandemic. 
The Department for Education said it had launched a pilot programme to improve the quality of school attendance data.
Blake, who is now 15, started skipping school when he was in year 8. 
""I started saying 'I'm going to school' and would just go somewhere else for a few hours. Then when lockdown came I did no work and I got even further behind than I was already. 
""I had big gaps in my knowledge and that was dead hard to fill."" 
Blake lost confidence and found it harder and harder to return to lessons. 
His school arranged for him to join a programme for pupils with low attendance at The Hive youth zone in Wirral, where he now has one-to-one tutoring. 
As a result Blake will sit some GCSEs this summer and expects to pass Maths and English, allowing him to take up the offer of work and training in a restaurant. 
Steve Fogg works with teenagers who aren't attending school
Steve Fogg,  who runs the course working with small groups of teenagers, fears more will fall through the gaps in the system coming out of the pandemic. 
""It's become much worse, young people got used to not going to school, and if they were having a bad experience before the pandemic, their anxieties rise being forced back into school.""
The reasons more teenagers are not attending are varied, but a loss of social and academic confidence is visible after the disruption of recent years. 
Even schools that have previously had very good attendance are seeing an increase in persistent absence. 
That's the case at St Margaret's Church of England Academy in Liverpool, where Stephen Brierley is the headteacher. 
They have a dedicated family liaison officer who gets to know parents or carers and work with them to find out what the barriers are to teenagers returning.
Stephen Brierley said the pandemic had made things worse
""There are some that have got out of the habit of coming to school, and some have extra social needs so have found it difficult to make that leap to come back to school.""
Mr Brierley isn't surprised there are some children who have never been to school at all. 
He has dealt with isolated cases of being asked by parents if he can find a place for a teenager who has not received any formal education, in school or through home education. 
Such cases are reported to the council because it raises potential concerns about the child's welfare. 
""If they are not in school they are at risk of criminal exploitation or being in harms way - it's safer for them to be in school.""
In the meantime schools and parents face the challenge of teenagers who have disengaged during the pandemic. 
Blake says his experience shows its worth persisting: ""If you've tried school and know you can't do it, try to find an alternative.   
""You're going to need your GCSEs, and you may as well do them now as later.""

Stool tests might provide a useful way to help doctors spot early pancreatic cancer, say researchers. 
They have been trialling the concept in a study with 136 volunteers. 
The findings, described in the journal Gut, external, suggest detectable changes involving gut bugs could provide a warning sign that a tumour is present. 
Pancreatic cancer often doesn't cause symptoms in the early stages. That means it is usually more advanced and harder to treat when it is found.
As the cancer grows it may cause vague symptoms, such as indigestion, changes to bowel habit and some tummy or back pain. Some people see their GP several times before being diagnosed. 
Know the signs of pancreatic cancer
Currently, fewer than one in 20 of those with the most common form - ductal adenocarcinoma - will survive for five years or more. Earlier detection could improve those odds.
The Spanish team behind the work recruited patients from two hospitals - one in Madrid and the other in Barcelona. Only some of the patients had pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, while the others were selected as controls for comparison. 
The researchers collected and analysed spit and stool samples from the volunteers to see if there was any discernible difference between the groups. 
While the saliva samples drew a blank, the stool ones did show a difference that the team believe could be useful for helping to diagnose pancreatic cancer. 
It was a distinct pattern or genomic profile of gut bacteria, fungi and other microbes.
This consistently identified patients with the disease, irrespective of how far it had progressed, suggesting that characteristic microbiome signatures emerge early on and that the stool microbiome might pick up early stage disease, say the researchers.
They recommend more studies - and some are already taking place.
Independent researchers in Germany have validated the findings in a small number of patients, and the test is also being trialled in Japan.

Consumer groups welcomed the proposed changes, but called for greater resources for enforcement
Social media sites and search engines could soon have to stop paid-for scam adverts appearing by law.
The updated proposal is part of the Online Safety Bill, a piece of landmark legislation trying to determine how sites deal with harmful content.
Campaign groups say being a scam victim can cause both financial and emotional devastation.
The government is also launching a consultation into how online advertising is regulated. 
Under a new legal duty being added to the bill, platforms will be required to put in place processes to block ads appearing online and remove them if they slip through the net. 
The idea is intended to better protect people from scams where criminals impersonate celebrities or companies to steal personal data, peddle unsafe financial investments or break into bank accounts.
Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries said: ""We are also announcing a review of the wider rules around online advertising to make sure industry practices are accountable, transparent and ethical - so people can trust what they see advertised and know fact from fiction.""
Martin Lewis, who founded Moneysavingexpert.com, and consumer group Which? both welcomed the news - they had called for scams to be included in the bill.
Mr Lewis described an ""epidemic of scam adverts"", adding: ""Scams don't just destroy people's finances - they hit their self-esteem, mental health and even leave some considering taking their own lives.
""The government now accepting the principle that scam adverts need to be included, and that firms who are paid to publish adverts need to be responsible for them, is a crucial first step.""
""Until now, only user-generated scams were covered - which risked pushing more scam ads, incentivising criminals to shift strategy.""
But the consumer champion thinks the scope of the bill could be wider. 
""We need to analyse and scrutinise this update - one of my concerns is it looks like display advertising that you see on third-party websites is not within the scope of the bill when it comes to scam adverts.""
Anabel Hoult, Which? chief executive, added: ""This could make a huge difference to stemming the tide of fake and fraudulent ads on social media and search engines which cause devastating financial and emotional harm to innocent victims.
""The Online Safety Bill must now ensure that the regulator has the support and resources it needs to hold companies to account and take strong enforcement action where necessary, so that fraudsters are prevented from using adverts to lure unsuspecting victims.""
It is hoped the ban on paid-for scam ads will make people feel safer online
Separately, the government is launching a consultation on proposals to tighten the rules for the online advertising industry. 
Social media influencers could face stronger penalties for failing to declare properly when they are being paid to promote products online.
Hashtags including ""#ad"" or ""#spon"" are often used in posts, but studies suggest some Instagram stars do not adhere to the rules.
Harmful or misleading adverts, such as those promoting negative body images, could also be subject to tougher rules but exactly how has yet to be ironed out. 
The communications regulator Ofcom will set out further details on what platforms will need to do to fulfil their new duty in codes of practice.
It could involve ID checks for those who publish ads, and ensuring that financial promotions are only made by official firms.

Prince Andrew and Virginia Giuffre have settled the court case
The Duke of York is paying a financial settlement to his accuser Virginia Giuffre - formally ending a civil case brought against him in the US, according to court documents.
A judge in New York signed the court papers on Tuesday, marking the final stage of settling the sex assault case.
The amount being paid by Prince Andrew in the deal agreed last month has not been revealed.
But the court documents say each side will ""bear her/his own costs and fees"".
There has been speculation about how Prince Andrew might afford the settlement, which could cost millions of dollars.
There have been suggestions he could use funds from selling a ski chalet in Switzerland - but the sale has so far not been completed, according to Prince Andrew's representatives on Tuesday.

Prince Andrew loses titles and use of HRH
Is there any way back for Prince Andrew?
Prince Andrew: Where does he get his money from?
A statement from the Treasury, in response to a Freedom of Information request, ruled out any public funding: ""No public money has been used to pay legal or settlement fees.""
There have been suggestions that the Queen could help to pay, using her private funds, but Buckingham Palace had declined to comment.
The latest ""stipulation of dismissal"" court papers showed the case being concluded, following the agreement reached between Prince Andrew and Ms Giuffre in February, which stopped the prospect of a courtroom battle in New York.
The signing of the papers by US district court judge Lewis Kaplan marks the end of this high-profile legal claim.
The out-of-court settlement accepted no liability and Prince Andrew has always strongly rejected claims of wrongdoing.
But the prince agreed to pay an unspecified amount to Ms Giuffre and to her charity for victims' rights.
He also said he ""never intended to malign Ms Giuffre's character"" and he recognised she had ""suffered both as an established victim of abuse and as a result of unfair public attacks"".
The duke also pledged to ""demonstrate his regret for his association"" with the sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.
In the wake of the claims, Prince Andrew lost military titles and royal patronages as well as the use of the title His Royal Highness.

James Brittain-McVey told MPs about his struggle to conform when starting out with his band, The Vamps
The Vamps' lead guitarist, James Brittain-McVey, has told MPs pressure to conform led him to have liposuction to remove breast tissue, aged just 20.
At a committee discussing the impact of body image on physical and mental health, the musician said he wished he had opened up to friends at the time.
And he said no doctor had ever asked if he was sure he wanted to have surgery.
Concerns over weight or body shape can often lead to eating disorders, which are particularly common in teenagers.
Two leading medical organisations have told BBC News GPs are not receiving the right support to treat eating disorders. 
Doctors said they needed more time with patients and more specialist units.
'Rabbit hole'
Brittain-McVey, 27, said he had started worrying about how his body looked aged 14-15. 
At school, he struggled to feel he fitted in - and that led him to the gym, prompted by what he saw advertised on social media and by ""big American surf style companies"".
""I had one of their shopping bags in my bedroom, of a guy ripped on a beach in Malibu, and I think unconsciously every morning I would think that is what I need to look like,"" the musician said.
""Social media encouraged me to fall further down that rabbit hole. 
""The first thoughts I would have when I woke up in the morning was, 'Should I be eating that, am I going to be able to get to the gym?""'
Support needed for GPs to treat eating disorders

He described worrying about what he ate aged 15-16 - and by the time The Vamps started, he decided to have surplus natural breast tissue in his chest, a condition called gynaecomastia, external, removed.
""People presume it was me striving for vanity - but it was pressure to conform to stereotypes and gender constructs,"" Brittain-McVey said. 
""And before I realised it, my whole life was controlled by this chase to look a certain way.""
'Clamping down'
His family was supportive of his decision but he was too embarrassed to tell many of his friends or bandmates.
The government should be ""clamping down on advertising"", he said, so ""bodies represent society and not unachievable bodies"".
""I worry about future generations,"" Brittain-McVey said.
""How on earth are they meant to feel comfortable within their skin if you go on apps now and you scroll and see another person that looks a certain way?""
Australian jungle
Cosmetic-surgery adverts are to be banned from targeting children in the UK, from May.
Asked if any doctors had discussed with him why he wanted liposuction, Brittain-McVey said: ""Before surgery, I don't think anyone said, 'Are you sure?'""
In 2018, he joined ITV's I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out Of Here! and came out of the Australian jungle having lost 4-5kg (11lb).
""My wife was shocked how ill I looked - but I was happy I had a six-pack again,"" he said.
The programme had been ""brilliant"" - but it had made him focus on the way he looked ""more than ever"".
""I still feel a pressure to look a certain way and that's why I worry for a lot of our fan base,"" he told the MPs.
The committee is considering, external whether NHS training on body-image issues should be changed and whether there is enough support, advice and regulation to ensure patient safety.

178,178,'We are not co-operating': Life in occupied Ukraine,"Wed, 09 Mar 2022 00:06:59 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-60670173,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-60670173?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,"Ukrainian cities are now occupied by Russian troops, and residents are not making them feel welcome.","'We are not co-operating': Life in occupied Ukraine
The scene in Melitopol. ""We have not stopped protesting,"" one resident said
In the southern Ukrainian city of Melitopol on Monday, the mayor Ivan Federov sat down at his desk to send out his daily Facebook update.
He told his followers that the Russian forces occupying the city had now taken control of the city's communications network, so they needed to be wary of what they heard on TV and the radio.
How many people would see his warning, he didn't know. Melitopol's internet connection had also all but disappeared, making it nearly impossible to reach people inside by WhatsApp or Telegram call, or stay connected for more than a few minutes.
The ordinary phone lines were no longer an option, Federov told the BBC, when the Telegram app finally connected. ""We cannot use,"" he said. ""Too easy for the Russians to listen in.""
When the invading forces took control of Melitopol a week ago they ransacked the mayor's offices, Federov said, exiling his team to another location where they are attempting to continue running their city.
""We are not co-operating with the Russians in any way,"" Federov said emphatically. ""They have not tried to help us, they cannot help us, and we do not want their help.""
The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has claimed he is liberating historically Russian lands and speakers from a Nazi regime. But in Melitopol and a string of other mainly-Russian speaking southern and eastern cities, his forces have found themselves treated as occupiers.
Russian military vehicles are seen on the street in Kherson, south-eastern Ukraine
""There are protests in Melitopol every day,"" said Yuliya Kovaliova, 33, who before the invasion helped run her family business of electronics stores. 
""At some point the Russian army started shooting at us and one man got shot but we have not stopped protesting,"" Kovaliova said. ""We are not afraid to protest because we are together. We are afraid to walk alone at night, but we are not afraid to protest.""
About 5,000 people gathered in Melitopol's central square on Tuesday, Federov reckoned, despite the shooting last week, which wounded a man in the leg. Videos have surfaced showing protests in occupied and part-occupied cities and towns across the region - Kherson, Berdyansk, Starobilsk, Novopskov. The BBC reached residents and local mayors to try to understand the situation inside.
""I don't know how to count the number of people protesting, I thought it was 2,000 at least,"" said Yunona, a 29-year-old IT worker in the southern city of Kherson. ""One of our friends was beaten and taken by the Russian soldiers and people got so angry they chased the occupiers down the street and took him back.""
The Russian troops in Kherson looked young and uncertain, said Olha, a 63-year-old English teacher. ""We go to the protests every day and they are close to us but they look afraid,"" she said. ""We are all just waiting for the Ukrainian army to kick them out.""
Berdyansk in the south-east has also seen protestors take to the streets
Reports of serious violence against Ukrainian protesters have been limited, for the most part Russian forces seem to be tensely watching. But some local mayors were facing a dilemma - how much to encourage their citizens to take to the streets.
""Our people need to protest but they also need to save their lives,"" said Federov, the Melitopol mayor. ""I have asked them - please do not go near the Russian soldiers, go around them.""
Vadym Gaev, the mayor of Novopskov, a town near Donbas, told the BBC there had been daily protests but they had stopped three days ago when Russian soldiers shot three protestors - non-fatally - and beat another. Gaev said the Russian troops told an intermediary they had authorisation to shoot protesters, so there should be no more protests.
Novopskov appeared to be an example of a strange and uneasy scenario playing out in some parts of Ukraine, where local Ukrainian officials were continuing to function in some form but Russian military forces were in control. In the occupied city of Starobilsk, nearby, mayor Yana Litvinova was also working remotely, she said. 
""A new 'administration' has been appointed. The only thing we know is that it is going around government buildings and asking people to co-operate, and they are refusing.""

President Zelensky: We will not give up, and we will not lose
Gaev and his team left town when Russia seized Novopskov, in order to keep his administration running - a move he said had divided residents, some of whom accused him of a betrayal while others said they were grateful he was still able to work. 
Two residents of Kherson told the BBC they thought the mayor there had betrayed the city by co-operating with Russian forces - an accusation circulating in Telegram chat groups. Two others said he was simply doing what he could to ensure the city kept running.
The mayor of Kherson, Igor Kolykhayev, told the BBC: ""If I had betrayed the city would I still be here? I am in the office every day, working with my team to keep things running.""
The priority was to restart food production and get people back to work, Kolykhayev said. 
""We are running out of food and there is no aid coming in, it's just not happening,"" he said. ""So we are telling everyone in the city: make any food you can make, manufacture anything you can manufacture.""

IN DEPTH: Full coverage of the conflict
Most residents who spoke to the BBC from the occupied cities said food was fast running out.
""Shops are almost empty. You can buy the things that are left but very few things are left,"" said Yuliya Kovaliova, the electronics shop owner from Melitopol. ""Pharmacies are empty and my mother can't buy her heart medicine.""
Kovaliova said that two Russian trucks with humanitarian markings came into the city centre last week and attempted to hand out food, but they also brought a film crew. Nearly everyone refused, she said. 
""Later we saw on it on TV. Russia has taken over the TV towers here so we only have one Russian channel being shown now and it was showing people taking the food and saying how thankful they are to the Russian humanitarian convoy.""
Maxim, a 22-year-old piano teacher in the city, also described the supposed humanitarian convoy. ""They were filming and people said actors arrived to take the food,"" he said. Yunona, the IT worker in Kherson, said she saw the same thing there, and Ukrainian media reported on the phenomenon in Berdyansk.
Ivan Federov, the mayor of Melitopol, said he had heard about these 'humanitarian convoys' too. But there were ""no real Russian trucks and no real Russian food,"" he said. 
""They could open humanitarian corridors at any time to allow food and medicine in, but they do not want to. We know, we have tried.""
On Tuesday afternoon, as usual, Federov put out his daily Facebook update, appealing to anyone in the city who could afford it to pay their utility bills and congratulating Ukraine's women on International Women's Day. ""I'm sure the war will end soon and we will celebrate all our holidays in a peaceful, Ukrainian Melitopol,"" he said.

179,179,Ukraine war: How reliant is the world on Russia for oil and gas?,"Tue, 08 Mar 2022 18:00:43 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/58888451,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/58888451?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,Russia says it may cut off gas supplies if countries decided to ban Russian oil.,"Russia sanctions: What impact have they had on its oil and gas exports?
Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, many countries have pledged to end or restrict their oil and gas imports to curtail Moscow's revenues and hinder its war effort.
The Russian economy is highly dependent on its energy sector, and Europe is a major importer of Russian energy, making cutting back difficult.
What sanctions are in place?
EU nations have ended imports of Russian oil brought in by sea, and a ban on refined oil products will come in from 5 February. 
The United States said last March it would stop importing Russian oil, and the UK said it was banning Russian crude oil and refined products with effect from 5 December, external. 
European countries have sought to reduce their dependence on Russian gas
An oil price cap approved by Western allies in December also aims to prevent Russia getting more than $60 (£48) for a barrel of crude oil.
Russia's gas sector has also been targeted. The EU said in March it would cut gas imports from Russia by two-thirds within a year. The UK, which only imported small quantities of Russian gas, it has now ended this altogether.
Have the sanctions been effective?
Urals oil is currently being exported from Russia's north western sea port of Primorsk for around $40 per barrel, from where it has largely gone to European destinations.
The value of Russian oil from other ports and pipelines varies, but the Urals price has fallen across the board since the EU banned imports of Russian oil by sea.
The price cap on Russian oil was agreed by the world's major economies at the same time. But energy analyst Ben McWilliams believes it is the EU oil embargo impacting the price, rather than the price cap. 
""Russian oil is being traded at around $50 (£40) per barrel. That has been driven by the embargo because Russia now has to try to sell elsewhere.""
Moscow is losing out on about $175m (£140m) a day from fossil fuel exports due to these measures, according to a study by the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA)., external
India is taking advantage of cheaper oil imported from Russia
Major Russian banks have also been removed from the international financial messaging system Swift.
Countries continuing to trade with Russia have sought ways around this. Both China and India are increasingly making their oil and gas purchases in their local currencies.
Who is buying Russian oil?
India, China and Turkey all ramped up their purchases of Russian oil last year - and together they now make up 70% of all Russian crude flows by sea.
And Russia was offering its oil at a significantly lower price than the global benchmark Brent crude. 
At the start of 2022, Russia supplied less than 2% of India's oil imports, but it is now on course to become its largest single supplier.
China's imports of Russian oil have fluctuated, but have also risen over the past year.
In 2021, more than half of all Russia's crude oil exports, external went to countries in Europe. But in 2022, UK imports of oil from Russia fell sharply and other European countries have cut back too. 
But some have remained heavily reliant, such as the Slovak Republic and Hungary.
European countries have been looking to see if they can source supplies elsewhere.
The International Energy Agency (IEA) club of oil importing countries agreed to release 120m barrels of crude from their stocks in 2022. The US also released some of its strategic reserves last year.
But calls for oil-rich nations such as Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Venezuela to increase production have not been successful.
Opec and other major oil producers cut production in late 2022 to sustain prices.
Europe still relies on Russian gas
Reducing gas imports from Russia has been a major challenge for many European countries, as the continent has been getting most of its gas through pipelines linked to Russia.
In 2021, Russia was supplying EU countries with 40% of their natural gas, with Germany the largest importer, followed by Italy and the Netherlands. That had dropped to around 17% by August 2022, according to EU figures., external
In 2021, the UK got just 4% of its gas supply from Russian. It now imports none.
EU states are increasingly looking to ship in liquefied natural gas, external (LNG) in tankers from producers such as the US and Qatar.
Your device may not support this visualisation
The shift towards LNG imports by European countries has been very significant, replacing supplies from Russia.
However, ""there aren't enough LNG terminals in Europe"", says energy advisor Kate Dourian. ""This will be a problem for Germany, particularly."" 
There are several new LNG terminals planned and some already under construction across Europe as countries try to boost their capacity.
Clarification 21 October: A previous version of this story contained a graphic with the title: 'The UK has much less gas storage than some other European countries'. The aim was to show how much gas the UK had in storage at that time. It was not intended to show the UK's total capacity for gas storage.

The BBC's Sarah Rainsford first spoke with Polina's mother Kseniya in the family home in Ukraine's second city, Kharkiv, last week. Polina's cancer medication was running out. The family risked the Russian military attacks outside to try and flee the city.
After four days on the run, Polina and her mother have now reached Poland, where they received a warm welcome from a Polish host family. Polina's father, like other men of military age, was unable to cross the border out of Ukraine.

This video, shared by Ukrainian armed forces, shows a Russian helicopter being shot down by a missile
Ukraine's military has released several videos showing Russian helicopters being shot down by surface-to-air missiles.
One, from last week, shows a Russian helicopter flying low, just above the tree line - in the hope of avoiding what's about to happen next. Tracking its path is the smoking trail of a surface-to-air missile. In a matter of seconds the missile has found its target. On impact the Russian helicopter crashes to the ground, before bursting into a fireball
Russian aircraft are being shot down by Ukrainian forces - as well as the video above, this video shows a jet hit near Kharkiv - and military analysts believe there's evidence that recently supplied weapons by the West are already being used.   
Justin Bronk, a research fellow on airpower at the Royal United Services Institute, says there's been visual confirmation of at least 20 Russian aircraft shot down in Ukraine so far - both helicopters and jets. That's significantly fewer than claimed by Ukraine's ministry of defence, which says it has downed 48 Russian planes and 80 helicopters., external Yet even the lower number shows Russia's struggled to gain supremacy in the skies.    
Ukraine has suffered losses too. But UK Defence Secretary Ben Wallace told the BBC that Russia had so far not been successful in destroying the country's air defences and air force.
Before the war began, Ukraine's military aircraft were outnumbered at least three-to-one by those that had been amassed on the border by Russia.
Mr Wallace said Ukraine's ability to keep some of its air defences intact was already forcing Russian aircraft to fly at night to avoid detection.
Shoulder-launched air defence missiles, also known as Manpads (man-portable air defence systems) are just one of the weapons that Western nations have been supplying to Ukraine. They include the infamous US-made Stinger surface-to-air missiles - scourge of Soviet aircraft during its occupation of Afghanistan in the 1980s.
Exact numbers are hard to come by. Last week Mr Wallace told the BBC the West had now delivered ""thousands"" of anti-tank weapons and ""over a thousand"" Stingers. CNN, quoting a US defence official, put the total at 17,000 anti-tank weapons and 2,000 Stingers, sent by the US and Nato allies.
Britain and America had provided weapons to Ukraine before the invasion began on 24 February, with the UK delivering 2,000 light anti-tank missiles (Nlaws). Commenting on reports that they were already being used to destroy Russian armoured columns, Mr Wallace said ""we've got anecdotal evidence to verify that"".   
Rifles and ammunition
Most countries, though, only started to send weapons in response to the Russian invasion. In all, 14 nations have supplied arms. They include Sweden and Finland, both of which have a long history of neutrality and are not members of Nato. But both have sent thousands of anti-tank weapons to Ukraine.
Germany has supplied 1,000 anti-tank weapons and 500 Stinger missiles. The Baltic states have also delivered thousands of weapons including Stingers and Javelin missiles, one of the world's most effective anti-tank weapons with a range of 2.5km (1.5 miles). Ukraine says it has already successfully destroyed several Russian T-72 tanks.
Recent weapons deliveries also include tens of thousands of assault rifles and machine guns, anti-tank mines and hundreds of tonnes of ammunition, as well as body armour and helmets, and medical supplies.

How are the weapons getting through?
The UK says it is helping ""facilitate"" the deliveries of these weapons. Western officials, though, are not giving details of how the supplies are getting through.
But it's no secret that while Russia's military operations have been focused in eastern Ukraine, the flow of people and supplies from the west of the country has continued via neighbouring European states. The BBC has spoken to the defence ministries of Estonia, Sweden and Denmark, all of whom confirmed their weapons supplies had been tracked and successfully reached Ukraine in recent weeks.   
So, how much difference are these weapons consignments making?
Weapons supplied by the West can make a difference, but only if Ukraine continues to have armed forces capable of using them.
Mr Bronk says Ukraine's ability to retain some of its older, Soviet-era, air defence systems - which have a longer range - has forced Russian aircraft to fly lower. But that makes them more vulnerable to the shorter-range surface-to-air missiles being supplied by the West.
Without those longer-range air defence systems, Russian aircraft could fly higher to avoid the dangers of shorter-range air defences.
Meanwhile, America and European allies are looking to increase their arms supplies to Ukraine. There may be a limited opportunity before Russia tries to target any supply lines of weapons.
The US Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, has said he's had talks with Poland about it supplying Russian-made Mig fighter jets to the Ukrainian Air Force. But even if that happened, Ukraine would still need trained pilots to fly them.
The supply of Western weapons helps, but you still need an army that knows how to use them.

The funeral in Moscow last week for a Russian sergeant killed in Ukraine
President Putin has directly addressed the mothers of soldiers serving in Ukraine, telling them: ""I know how worried you are"" and trying to reassure them. But some mothers, grandmothers, sisters and girlfriends have been telling the BBC they are desperately anxious about loved ones in the military - young men who appear to have had little idea what they were being sent to do. 
All names have been changed
When Marina hadn't heard from her grandson for more than a week, she started making calls. In his final message to her, he said he was on the Belarus-Ukraine border and would be home soon. But with no news since, she fears the worst.
""I phoned his military unit, they said he hadn't left [Russia]. 'I said - are you joking? He contacted me from Belarus. Do you not know where your soldiers go?' They hung up and didn't talk to me any more.""
Marina's grandson Nikita was originally a conscript. Men in Russia aged 18-27 who do not have an exemption - such as studying or looking after young children - are drafted into the military for a year. 
But Marina says in Nikita's first few days of service, representatives of military units arrived in their region, hoping to get conscripts to become contracted soldiers in order to lengthen their military service and earn a salary. Contractors make up the bulk of Russia's junior service personnel. 
They ""convinced him""... ""[They told him] you can retire early, you will have a steady salary, you will learn how to drive.""
Nikita became a driver in a mechanised infantry division, but his earnings did not translate into a comfortable standard of living. His monthly salary of 18,000 roubles - $240 (£180) before the rouble crashed - was just enough to get by on in rural Russia. And, he told his grandmother, he was expected to pay for uniform and petrol out of that salary. He had free accommodation in barracks but could not bear the freezing conditions - there was no heating or hot water - so had to pay for rent as well, she says.
It is difficult to establish how common Nikita's experience is, but the scores of Russian companies who help young men find loopholes to avoid the draft suggest the army is not seen as an attractive prospect. 
In mid-February, Nikita told his grandmother he was moving to the Ukraine-Belarus border ""to guard it"". He also told her he had heard they would soon be returning home. 
There has been no word from him since he last texted her on 23 February - a Russian public holiday - to say he was at a concert.
She is certain her grandson had no idea he would be sent into combat in Ukraine.
""He said, 'It's drills and more drills and then we go home',"" a line repeated by many Russian soldiers' relatives we spoke to.  
Military drills in Belarus just before the Russian invasion of Ukraine - many families thought that was all their son or partner was going to be doing
Another woman, Galina, says she only realised her son Nikolai was in Ukraine when her sister spotted his photo on the Facebook page of Ukraine's armed forces' chief as a POW. 
A US Pentagon briefing on Friday suggested that a significant number of the men fighting in Ukraine are conscripts, and that might account for their inexperience and lack of awareness about what they were expected to do. 
But it appears the men's belief - that they were simply on drills rather than being sent into combat - was not unique to conscripts. Like Marina's grandson Nikita - and many of the other men whose relatives we spoke to - Galina's son Nikolai began as a conscript, but was now a contracted soldier. 
Galina says she last heard from Nikolai the day before her sister spotted his photo, when he told her his unit was near the Ukrainian border.
""I don't know what to do. The media is silent about the fact that our guys were captured. Or they don't know.""
Nikolai's girlfriend says he became a contract soldier last December to ""provide for his future family"", despite her efforts to dissuade him. His mother adds that there are no other opportunities to earn decent money locally.
""My child did not go [to Ukraine] of his own free will, the commander-in-chief sent him there,"" she says.
""To be honest, I don't understand what it's all for,"" she says. ""In our country, some people have nothing to eat. I don't understand any war or any military action.
""Whose door should I knock on to get my child back?"" 
This sense of impotence is shared by another mother the BBC spoke to, whose son also worked as a contract soldier and was sent away on ""drills"". 
""If I knew where he is now, I would have packed up myself and gone to these people and begged them for mercy,"" she says.
Historically, soldiers' mothers in Russia have been outspoken about how the military has been deployed and treated, and have agitated for the authorities to be more open about casualty figures. 
They played a particularly significant role in agitating against both of Russia's Chechen wars, waging a widely publicised campaign, external.  
Mothers of soldiers deployed in Chechnya waged a powerful campaign to bring their sons home
But a new law passed in the country last week threatens anyone seen to be spreading what the government deems ""fakes"" about military action in Ukraine with 15 years in jail. 
The Russian public has also been exposed to powerful anti-Ukraine propaganda from Russian state-run media. The sister of one man she believes is missing in Ukraine said she thought there must be a good reason for the invasion.
""And now we are called to rallies. To me it looks like they [Ukraine] have destroyed their [own] country, and now they want to destroy another.""
Ukraine has sought to counter that propaganda with a powerful campaign of its own. A helpline called ""Look for your own"" (Ishchi Svoikh in Russian) was first advertised on day three of what Russia was describing as a ""special military operation to demilitarise and denazify"" the country. A companion Telegram channel carries photos of Russian POWs and casualties, and encourages worried relatives to get in touch. The Washington Post has highlighted concerns, external about the publication of the graphic images.
""This is our gesture of good will to the Russian mothers,"" Ukrainian presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovych announced. 
A flyer carried on the Ukrainian interior ministry Facebook page goes even further, making a direct call to Russian mothers to come and collect their sons, and gives specific instructions about what to do.
""We, Ukrainian people, in contrast to [Russian President] Putin's fascists, do not make war with mothers and their captured sons,"" it says.
Despite these appeals, all the relatives we spoke to had no view on the legitimacy of Russia's action in Ukraine or supported it.
But the text exchange of one woman with her soldier fiance - which she showed to the BBC - suggested that in his case he did not buy into the Russian rhetoric that they were entering Ukraine to ""liberate"" the population. 
In it, he tells his fiancee that he is off on ""a tour around some countries"" - possibly referring to Russia's ally and neighbour Belarus - before saying he is going to ""defend the defenceless, LOL"". 
When she asks ""Are you joking?"" he simply replies: ""No. I am going to war.""
Russia finally published death toll figures for its combatants in the invasion last week, saying that as of 3 March 498 Russian troops had been killed and a further 1,597 injured. But Ukraine says that more than 11,000 Russian military have been killed, though this cannot be verified.

The BBC's Clive Myrie, who has left Ukraine, reflects on the indomitable locals he met in Kyiv - convinced they would defeat the Russians.
I didn't really see her face, but at her feet were several cooing pigeons. Every now and again, a shower of birdseed would tumble from her hand. She was wearing a heavy-looking grey coat, keeping out the late morning winter chill. I motioned to my colleague, cameraman David McIlveen, to try to take her picture - but she sensed he was approaching, emptied the brown paper bag of birdseed and briskly walked away.
It was the first time in 48 hours that I had left our lodgings - a basement car park in the heart of Kyiv which had become a make-shift bomb shelter. A weekend-long curfew had been imposed after Russian troops had invaded the country.  There was a real fear foreign saboteurs were moving among the population and anyone caught outdoors would have been arrested. 
You could see the nervousness on the faces of the soldiers and partisans manning checkpoints, despite the black balaclavas shielding them from the cold. Their eyes told stories of apprehension, concern, worry and existential threat. Russian spies might be plotting routes for incoming troops, or smuggling weapons into the Ukrainian capital, or simply there to somehow sow seeds of discord among ordinary people to break local unity.  
The city was awash with rumour and dread. Who might that be in the bomb shelter next to you, who is listening in to your conversation in the bread queue? Best stay indoors and observe the curfew. 
The woman feeding the pigeons would have spent the past two days in her own basement as well, and I thought it was interesting that one of the first things she did was to feed the pigeons - as if nothing was awry. An ordinary day out, a bit of fresh air, with no threat of death from above.  
Prepared to die
A few other people were on the streets, queuing outside a supermarket which had little on its shelves. Most people were shuttered at home. Villages, towns and cities across the land saw a vanishing, as citizens descended underground to subterranean worlds of refuge. 
Vladimir Putin professes to know what the 40 million-plus population of this land want. A few days among these people would have told him much more than he seems to understand. 
In an elegant apartment block in the centre of Kyiv, one flat has become a sort of commune for young people who have just moved to the city from the sticks and need a place to crash while they find their feet. It is clean and tidy with a mattress for a sofa in the main room - but still the paraphernalia of student life is on show. There are several guitars lying around and posters on the wall. Giorgy, our local fixer and driver, introduces us to some of his friends. All are in their early 20s and have been waiting tables or studying at college. Oleksiy, 22, a waiter in a local bar, also plays in a rock band.  
Now, all that's on hold. He may have to fight the Russians.  
""I am prepared to die for my country, for what I love,"" he told me in perfect English. ""Putin doesn't understand we don't want his authority - his world. All of us here know what we want - the right to live our own lives, the right to choose who leads us. That's our right, not Moscow's.""
Ukrainian volunteer soldiers, Kyiv, 4 March 2022
I had met other reserve army volunteers who'd put themselves forward to fight while I was in Ukraine. They all displayed the same patriotism and love of their country that Vladimir Putin didn't think existed. They were firm in their convictions and convinced they would prevail - despite the Russian military's greater numbers.  
While speaking to Oleksiy, there was a commotion outside with the sound of police sirens in the street below. A long convoy of Ukrainian military vehicles was heading up the road and bystanders were applauding the troops. It was clear the Kremlin thought these people would be cowed by Moscow's ostentatious display of might, with Russian troops stationed on the Ukrainian border for several weeks to intimidate. 
Not a chance. These people will fight. 
The teenage Russian conscripts in their tanks and armoured personnel carriers who had crossed the border to the north, south and east, have quickly become disabused of Putin's jaundiced view of Ukraine. After the invasion, video footage began to emerge of Ukrainians berating the foreign army, yelling at them ""Go home"" and ""We don't want you here.""

IN DEPTH: Full coverage of the conflict
And this was happening even in Russian-speaking parts of the north-east. There were pictures of people lying in the road to block the movement of Russian tanks. Others were throwing bicycles beneath tank tracks - there were no flowers or garlands of welcome. Pictures of Ukrainian men urinating on Russian vehicles, and a dog cocking a hind leg on the tail fin of a missile sticking out of the ground, went viral. On Twitter, one person quipped ""give piss a chance!""
On a visit to the magnificent St Sophia Cathedral - a stunning riot of frescoes and gold - I watched an interfaith prayer service for peace, as the war raged across the country. Orthodox, Catholic, Jewish, Muslim - all were united. A little later, Ukraine's interior minister Denys Monastyrskyy in a bullet-proof vest turned up seeking divine guidance. Four heavily armed Ukrainian army soldiers were protecting him. I asked him if faith was what underpinned the Ukrainian belief that they could defeat the second-largest army on the planet. 
Speaking softly, he was unequivocal and clear-eyed - just like the young Ukrainian reservists I had spoken to days earlier. ""God is on our side,"" he told me with deep conviction. ""We will win."" And to drive home the point, he repeated those words in Ukrainian: ""My vyhrayemo"".
Also attending the prayer service was military chaplain Oleksandr Mishura. He had a yellow armband on his right bicep, the insignia of the volunteer brigades - or the citizen soldiers. He said morale was high among the troops he ministered to, and that the soldiers had no choice but to fight to defend and protect the country. He took my arm and looked straight at me. He shared a sentiment that I suspect many in Ukraine believe - ""We all know what the Bible says, when the enemy is wicked, God will always intervene.""
Shortly before my assignment in Kyiv ended, I began to think about the people I would leave behind to an uncertain fate. They included a mother and her 18-year-old daughter who shared our underground shelter. One morning, the daughter's crying woke me up. She had got word that her father, who had been living near the Chernobyl nuclear plant, had apparently been harmed by a group of Russian soldiers. They had ransacked his house looking for cigarettes and alcohol. The teenager feared the worst. 
Throughout the day she tried to call her father, but he wasn't picking up the phone. All of us in the shelter prayed he was still alive. When word finally came from his neighbour, that he was safe and unharmed, it felt like a tiny victory for all of us. I thought about the other dwellers of the underground shelter. The woman with a very large white fluffy cat and the children who had run around playing games oblivious to the madness of adults above ground. 
I am writing this from a hotel in Romania having left Ukraine via Moldova a couple of days ago. I can't get the image of the woman feeding the pigeons out of my head. She was risking bombs and missiles to feed the pigeons. For me, she represents strength and courage - the indomitability of an independent state, not the cowering fear of the colonised.

Many of the front pages carry images of Ukranian President Volodymyr Zelensky receiving a standing ovation from MPs after his unprecedented video address to Parliament.
""Hear Hear, Hero"" headlines the Metro, external, while the Daily Express declares ""Zelensky echoes Churchill, external"".   
The i also notes the Ukrainian president ""channelled"" Britain's wartime leader, external while telling MPs that his people would fight Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion in ""the forests and the streets - to the death if necessary"".
The Daily Mirror similarly quotes Mr Zelensky as insisting: ""We will never surrender, external"". The accompanying picture shows a Ukrainian police officer in the besieged city of Irpin saying an emotional goodbye to his toddler son. His family is fleeing, while he remains to fight.
The leader columns deliver their equivalent of a standing ovation. The Times says, external Mr Zelensky spoke not just for Ukraine, but for law, liberty and civilisation itself, while the Daily Mail declares: ""We salute him and his indefatigable nation, external"". The Sun says the speech was ""as stirring as it was historic, external"". 
The headline the Guardian's front page reads: ""Blow to Putin"". The paper says that the ban on Russian oil by Britain and the US, external could cost Moscow five billion pounds, but also warns that the West will feel the squeeze too, as the measures push up prices at the pumps. It points out that 8% of Britain's oil and 4% of its gas come from Russia and claims that, as a result, Conservative MPs are ""clamouring"" for a reduction in fuel duty.

The front page splash for the Daily Telegraph is what it describes as the ""Rent-a-Mig"" scheme, external, which would see Poland's entire fleet of 28 Russian-made fighter-planes put at the disposal of the US for potential deployment in Ukraine. 
The Times warns, external that such a deal would risk a ""new confrontation"", and says such a move could mean that Nato aircraft, flown by Ukrainian pilots, would go into combat with Russian forces, potentially dragging the alliance into direct conflict with Moscow. Since the plan was announced, US officials have said they were not consulted in advance and that it is not ""tenable"". 
The faces of young and old, external leaving the city of Irpin are the focus of a double page spread of photos in The Daily Mirror. 
Under the headline ""Inhumane - Refugees under attack"" it examines the human cost of war and attacks the response of the UK Home office to the growing refugee crisis. 
It publishes a league table of European countries according to the number of visas they've granted to fleeing Ukrainians since the crisis began. At the top is Poland with more than 1.2 million. At the bottom is the UK, with what The Mirror describes as a ""paltry"" 500. The Times reports that senior Tory MPs have called for Home Secretary Priti Patel to quit, external over what's described as Britain's ""chaotic"" response.  
The Sun's front page headline reads: ""Queen's Guard Awol to fight Vlad, external"". The story reports that a 19-year-old Coldstream Guardsman has abandoned his post at Windsor Barracks and left a note for his parents explaining that he has gone to join the fighters defending Ukraine. 
The paper says defence chiefs are now trying to intercept him amid fears that Russia could claim Britain had entered the war were he to be captured by the Russian military.

Racheal has been studying in Ukraine since November
An Irish medical student trying to leave Ukraine ""won't reach the EU border"" on Tuesday, her sister said.
Racheal Diyaolu, who is 19 and from Carlow, was among hundreds of international students in the city of Sumy when the Russian invasion began. 
Sumy is one of many areas in Ukraine that has experienced heavy shelling.
There is a fresh attempt to let civilians leave the north-eastern Ukranian city, following new ceasefire agreements.
Earlier on Tuesday, Racheal's sister, Christiana, told BBC Radio Foyle that Racheal is currently ""heading towards safety"".
Christiana later tweeted that her sister's progress had slowed and that they would not reach the border due to the travel curfew in Ukraine.

Racheal Diyaolu
Christiana said her sister is travelling with two Scottish men who went to Ukraine to help with evacuating refugees.
Racheal left Sumy on Monday morning with the two men from Falkirk with whom Racheal's family had been in contact.
A previous rescue effort failed on Sunday when a minivan used by the men was targeted by ""warning shots"" from Russian forces as they tried to enter the city, Racheal had said.
'The relief is indescribable'
""She [Racheal] is still in Ukraine, but she has left Sumy and is now heading to the border and heading to safety,"" Christiana Diyaolu said on Tuesday.
""The relief is indescribable, we have had honestly so many bad days and now for this good news to happen - we are just delighted."" 
She said her communication with her sister has been ""on and off"" because the group she is travelling with has been using her phone as a Sat Nav. 
She added that when they stop or take a break from driving, her sister checks in with her family and keeps them updated.
The initial plan was for the group to head toward the Moldovan border, but Christiana believes that may not now be the case. 
""We think they are now heading to a nearby country's border, we aren't really sure which one now, but we know she is heading toward a border at least."" 
Russian forces have been heavily shelling towns outside the capital of Kyiv
She said her sister is very lucky to be leaving the country, but has mixed emotions as some university friends remain in Sumy.
Christiana said she cannot wait to give her sister a hug when she returns home, and is counting down the hours until they are reunited.
Ms Diyaolu arrived in the country from the Republic of Ireland for her studies last November.
Since the invasion started, she had been taking cover in her university's bunker when air raid sirens have sounded.
Speaking to BBC News NI before her latest attempt to leave Sumy, Racheal said she and fellow classmates would regularly be told to take shelter in a bunker.

Civilian casualties have continued to mount as Russian military forces shelled various cities in Ukraine throughout the night and early hours of Tuesday morning, according to Ukraine's State Emergency Service (SES).
Ms Diyaolu's family have been calling for more help from the Irish government to bring her home.
Ireland's Department of Foreign Affairs said it could not comment on specific cases, but confirmed it was in contact with Irish citizens in Ukraine.
""The Department of Foreign Affairs remains in ongoing contact with registered Irish citizens in Ukraine, currently totalling around 55,"" a spokesman said.
The department has advised people to ""shelter in a secure place"" or, if it is safe to do so, to ""consider leaving Ukraine, depending on their location and prevailing circumstances"".

It's been over a week since Home Secretary Priti Patel first appeared in Parliament to outline the government's response to the growing humanitarian crisis caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
Now the number of people fleeing the country has reached two million, according to the UN's refugee agency, and yet the number granted access to the UK still sits in the hundreds.
Ministers talk of moving ""at pace"" to ensure the UK has a ""generous"" policy towards those Ukrainians who want to come to the UK.
But there is growing frustration - even fury - from some MPs at what they so far see as an inadequate response.
On Tuesday, Home Office Minister Kevin Foster was met with a barrage of criticism from all sides when he was sent to the House of Commons to defend the government's approach.
MPs cited tales of chaos and confusion told to them by their constituents; relatives turned away from visa centres in Poland, appointments only available weeks from now, centres closed in Brussels, personal details lost and applications delayed.
Tory backbencher Alec Shelbrooke called on the Home Office to ""get a grip"".
So what is going on?
What is the UK doing for Ukrainian refugees?
At UK visa centre in Poland: 'There could be riots'
Zelensky invokes Churchill as he appeals to MPs
The Home Office says it had made significant progress in providing routes for refugees in a short space of time - talking of ""surging"" staff to countries across Europe to support visa applications, training more case workers in the UK, and establishing help-lines and pop-up centres.
The government has been clear that security checks must be carried out, saying some people in Calais had already presented with false documents pretending to be Ukrainian to gain entry to the UK.
While some MPs want these requirements waived, others say the checks themselves aren't the problem - it's the pace at which things are moving.
Labour MPs say the system is being held up by Home Office bureaucracy, which has resulted in a slow, shambolic and chaotic response.
Some Conservatives agree.
Whole new approach
There is understanding that the department responsible for law and security might ordinarily take a cautious approach, but there is frustration that ministers have failed to realise the current situation requires something out of the ordinary.
Former Home Secretary Amber Rudd told the BBC that the Home Office needed a whole new approach rather than business as usual, saying it was ""baffling and disappointing"" that so few visas had so far been issued to Ukrainian refugees.
Several Conservative MPs point to the fact it's been a week since the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities was tasked with setting up a new humanitarian route for refugees, but so far there's scant detail about how it might work, while the existing scheme for family members of those in the UK seems to be moving slowly.
The former Immigration Minister Mark Harper drew comparisons with the implementation of the furlough scheme at the start of the Covid pandemic.
""The Home Office does, of course, have to make sure the appropriate security measures are in place, but it needs to move at a pace that matches the scale of events,"" he said.
""The government can do this when it needs to, as we saw when the Treasury designed and rolled out the furlough scheme in four days at the start of the pandemic. 
""That's the scale of bold, imaginative policy and operational response we need to see from the Home Office.""
Home Secretary Priti Patel has come under scrutiny over visa numbers for Ukrainians
For some, it comes down to leadership.
Ms Patel's claim that a visa application centre had been established in Calais when it hadn't was described as ""eye watering"" by one backbencher.
One former cabinet minister said Home Office officials needed direction and drive that had so far been lacking, a combination of strong leadership and micro-management to make things happen.
Another Conservative backbencher suggested a home secretary keen to display a tough stance on immigration might have misjudged the public and political mood - something strongly rejected by Ms Patel's supporters, who point out there's no planned cap on the number of Ukrainians who can come to the UK.
Some Conservative backbenchers agree the problem has been one of practicalities - failing to get the right people in the right place quickly enough -  rather than political ideology. 
Strikingly, two former ministers with knowledge of the Home Office both used the same phrase - it's more likely cock-up than conspiracy.
The government has now appointed Richard Harrington as a minister for refugees to work across the Home Office and the Department for Levelling Up, perhaps an acknowledgement of the need for progress.
Ministers have promised regular updates on efforts already underway to speed up the system, though MPs will want to see results on the ground. 
So far there's been a deliberate display of unity from across the political spectrum over the response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, but when it comes to the government's response to a growing refugee crisis, there will be continued pressure.

Wanted: multilingual former soldiers willing to covertly head into Ukraine for the handsome sum of up to $2,000 (£1,523) per day - plus bonus - to help rescue families from an increasingly grim conflict.
It sounds ripped from the script of an action movie, but the job advert is real - taken from an employment website, Silent Professionals, for those working in the private military and security industry.
And, insiders say, demand is growing. Amid a gut-wrenching war in Ukraine, US and European private contractors say they are increasingly eying opportunities, ranging from 'extraction' missions to helping with logistics.
There is ""a frenzy in the market"" for private contractors in Ukraine today, said Robert Young Pelton, a Canadian American author and expert on private military companies (PMCs). 
But the demand for paid security workers - many of them former soldiers with ability to fight and kill - in the midst of a war leaves plenty of room for mistakes, and the potential for bedlam. 
Even as Westerns volunteers are joining the fight in Ukraine, for which they can expect to be paid the same as their Ukrainian counterparts, money is being offered by private interests for security services like the one advertised on Silent Professionals. 
The recruitment platform would not say who it was advertising for, but according to Mr Pelton, contractors are being hired for between $30,000 and $6m to help remove people from Ukraine. The higher-end figure is for whole groups of families wanting to leave with their assets, he said. 
The price of evacuations depends on the complexity of the work, said Tony Schiena, CEO of Mosaic, a US-headquartered intelligence and security advisory firm already operating in Ukraine.
""When there's a larger amount of people, the risk goes up. Children and families are more difficult. It all depends on the methods we get them across"".
Mosaic's missions are largely intelligence-driven, rather than armed, said Mr Schiena, a former South African intelligence operative whose firm includes several former high-ranking US intelligence officials on its board.
They are working with private clients, corporations and PIPs - politically exposed people - to help evacuate them from Ukraine, Mr Schiena told the BBC. 
He claimed an ""intelligence agency of a pretty large country"" that wanted to get its citizens out was among his clients.
""Depending on how the conflict plays out, I think there will be a constant demand for [PMCs],"" Mr Schiena said. ""There's a constant need, and as [the war] escalates or de-escalates, there's always going to be something that we're approached to do"".
Private military contractors contracted by the US State Department in Afghanistan in 2005
Private military and security firms have existed for decades, but were thrust into the public eye during the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan after 9/11, working on behalf of Western governments and commercial interests.
At the height of the Iraq war, tens of thousands of private contractors, such as Blackwater, were operating there. Tasks ranged from armed missions such as convoy protection to feeding and housing troops at military bases. Blackwater became notorious after a number of high-profile incidents, including the death of 14 Iraqi civilians shot dead by its contractors in Baghdad in 2007. 
In Eastern Europe, private firms have long been used to protect wealthy people and corporations. 
During the break-up of the former Yugoslavia, a number of firms were also hired to help equip, train and organise Bosnian and Croatian forces - all with the blessing of the US government.
The nature of the industry means that tracking the number of contractors and money is difficult, but it is by all accounts a growing industry. A report from Aerospace & Defense News found that the global private military and security industry will be worth over $457bn (£348bn) in 2030, up from about $224bn in 2020.
Contractors or mercenaries?
Foreign military contractors say they are not fighting in Ukraine. 
Some say they are being approached to help NGOs and humanitarian organisations in Ukraine or neighbouring countries in need of people with specialised skills and experience working in austere conditions in conflict zones.
""Most of the guys I personally know going over are doctors, physician assistants, paramedics, nurses and former special ops guys - or non-special ops guys - who are combat vets and understand,"" said Mykel Hawke, a former US special forces officer who has worked as a war zone contractor.
The comic travelling 5,000 miles to fight for Ukraine
Why is Russia invading Ukraine and what does Putin want?
Western contractors are governed by the laws and regulations of their own countries, said Christopher Mayer, a former US Army Colonel who worked with PMCs in Iraq.
They are supposed to protect people, places or assets, rather than engage in direct combat. 
Many in the industry bristle at the suggestion that they are 'mercenaries' or soldiers of fortune.
""It's the same kind of work that you see in the United States and elsewhere,"" Mr Mayer said. ""The difference is that in areas of conflict, the likelihood of having to use lethal force is much, much higher"".
In practice, though, the line is blurry. 
""If you have the skillset to be a private contractor, you have the skillset to be a mercenary. There's no bright line between the two,"" said Sean McFate, an-ex US paratrooper who later served as a contractor in Africa and elsewhere. ""It comes down to market circumstances and the decision of the individual person.""
""People talk about legitimacy and who the client is. None of that matters,"" he added. ""If you can do one, you can do the other"". 
The proliferation of PMCs may lead to as much ""chaos and mayhem"" as good, he warned.
""Mercenaries historically elongate conflict for profit,"" he added. ""It could get to a point in the mid-century where super-rich people have private armies, and I don't know how that looks.""

Examples of such companies taking an offensive approach to conflict include the South Africa-based Executive Outcomes, which fought on behalf of the government of Angola and Sierra Leone in the 1990s.
Sandline International, headquartered in London, was involved in conflicts in Papua New Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.
And members of Russian mercenary groups are said to be on the ground in Ukraine.
But Simon Mann, the former British special forces officer founder for Executive Outcomes and Sandline, told the BBC that the prospect of using Western contractors for offensive missions in Ukraine is ""highly unlikely"" and would pose complicated legal and organisational questions. 
""How [would they be] funded? How [would they be] commanded? Where would they fit in the Ukraine order of battle?"" he asked. ""Would they be duly enrolled in the national armed forces before any operations? If not, then what would be their legal position? Casualties? Medical cover? Death and disability insurance?""
Mr Mann - who spent several years in prison after being accused of leading an aborted coup d'état in Equatorial Guinea in 2004 - said that he is aware, however, of evacuation missions charging £10,000 per person, ""mostly organised by PMC-type people who happen to have contacts on the ground"".
Some have warned that even paid-for rescue missions into Ukraine could be fraught with danger for contractors and clients alike, and that the industry is awash with people misrepresenting their ability or experience.
Orlando Wilson, a former British soldier and long-time security contractor, said that he believes that most of the talk surrounding private contractors in Ukraine is ""rubbish"".
""I don't see how people can operate in Ukraine at the moment, at least not privately,"" he said.
""If you're caught by either side or one of the militias, they'll just take you as a spy and that's it,"" Mr Wilson added. ""It wouldn't be safe for people doing it and it wouldn't be safe for the clients"".

194,194,Russia-Ukraine: Is internet on verge of break-up?,"Wed, 09 Mar 2022 01:02:56 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-60661987,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-60661987?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,The global internet is under threat as the conflict in Ukraine continues.,"Russia-Ukraine: Is internet on verge of break-up?
Many of the rules of global business have been torn up following the Russian invasion of Ukraine - will the internet be next?
The world, both physical and digital, finds itself in unprecedented times as the conflict in Ukraine rages.
Corporate giants such as Meta, Google and Apple, who have always framed themselves as neutral tech firms, are now pinning their political colours to the mast - banning products in Russia in response to its invasion.
Meanwhile the internet itself is changing for Russian users - with Twitter and Facebook blocked, TikTok not allowing Russian users to post, and the police reportedly stopping people in the streets to look at what they are viewing on their phones.
Now there are questions about whether the conflict may not just alter the world's geography, but fundamentally change the nature of the global internet.
Should Russia be cut off from the internet?
Recently Russian ISPs have been asked to test a Russian version of the net
The Ukrainian government has singled out individual tech firms to ask them to ban services in Russia, and the list of tech firms refusing to do business or sell products there is growing by the day.
Now Ukraine's tech-savvy leaders are calling for something bigger - for Russia to be completely unplugged from the global internet.
The calls were answered with an emphatic ""No"" from ICANN (the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers), which is in charge of internet governance. It was asked to revoke Russia's top-level domains such as .ru along with the nation's associated Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) certificates.
But its tagline is ""One World, One Internet"" and in his response, external to Ukraine's deputy prime minister Mykhailo Fedorov, ICANN's chief executive  Goran Marby said: ""Within our mission, we maintain neutrality and act in support of the global internet. Our mission does not extend to taking punitive actions, issuing sanctions, or restricting access against segments on the internet - regardless of the provocations.""
Digital privacy group Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) was one of several organisations to support the decision.
In a statemen, externalt, EFF's Corynne McSherry and Konstantinos Komaitis said that war was no time to ""mess with the internet"". Interfering with fundamental internet infrastructure protocols would have ""dangerous and long-lasting consequences.""
These would include:
depriving people of the most powerful tool for sharing information
setting a dangerous precedent
compromising security and privacy
Cloudflare, a web infrastructure firm which offers protection against cyber-attacks, has also been asked by Ukraine to terminate its services inside Russia.
In a blog, external, the firm said it had considered these requests, but concluded that ""Russia needs more internet access, not less"".
What is a Splinternet and how does it work?
China's version of the internet is very different from the one seen in the West
For many, the calls for the cut-off were a dangerous slippery slope towards what is known as the Splinternet - where different countries have different versions of the internet.
The Great Firewall of China, as it is known, is perhaps the most obvious example of how a country can create its own web.
But in Iran too, net content is policed, and external information is limited by the state-owned Telecommunication Company of Iran. 
Russia itself has been experimenting with a sovereign internet - dubbed Runet - for several years, albeit one that has been retro-fitted to the existing internet rather than China's built-from-the-ground-up version.
In 2019, the Russian government said it had successfully tested the system. At the time few understood the need for it, but now, in the context of the Ukraine invasion, it all ""makes a whole lot more sense"", said Prof Alan Woodward, a computer scientist from the University of Surrey.
In that test,  Russian ISPs were asked to effectively configure the internet within their borders as if it were a giant intranet - a private network of websites that don't speak to the outside world.
The initiative involved restricting the points at which Russia's version of the net connected to its global counterpart.
Now it appears Russia is re-testing those systems - in a memo from the Russian government, ISPs were asked to beef up their security and connect to domain name system (DNS) servers in Russia.
Some thought the memo, and the date for completion of the test on 11 March, meant Russia intended to cut itself off imminently.
Prof Woodward sees it more as another test of preparedness: ""This was more about Russia calling on ISPs to get ready, to make local copies of the DNS - the phone book of the internet - and to have local versions of third-party software that comes from servers outside Russia, such as Javascript.""
Russia has since denied it will cut itself off, saying the test was about protecting Russian websites from foreign cyber-attacks.
But James Griffiths, author of The Great Firewall of China, thinks the plug could be pulled at any time: ""Cutting off the internet, making sure Russians are only consuming the content that the Kremlin approves of, that kind of thing makes sense strategically, so you can see the path we're headed down,"" he told the BBC.
""I wouldn't be surprised if that came into force in the coming weeks or months.""
What would be the consequences of that?
Is a fractured internet inevitable?
Abishur Prakash, author of the book The World is Vertical: How Technology is remaking Globalisation, thinks the conflict is reshaping the internet, from ""a global system that the whole world has been plugged into"" to something more fractured.
""Because of geopolitics, a different design for the internet is emerging, where nations are either cut off or are developing their own alternative. The global bridges, like social media platforms, that have connected populations for decades, are being brought down.""
And, according to James Griffiths, the new axis of net power will be divided between the West and China/Russia.
""Fang Binxing, known as the founding father of China's Great Firewall, visited Russia in 2016 to assist them in what they're doing and make the Russian firewall much more similar to the Chinese one,"" he said
And now Russia will once again look to Beijing, as internet firms withdraw services and products, he thinks: ""As the Russian economy is cut off from a lot of the global economy, they are turning to China. They will have to rely on China even more so than they have in the past.""
So far tech firms such as Huawei have said nothing official on the conflict.

195,195,Ukraine crisis: Is the UK doing enough to help refugees?,"Tue, 08 Mar 2022 14:22:38 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/60555166,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/60555166?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,How is the government helping Ukrainian refugees in the UK and in countries neighbouring Ukraine?,"How do the UK's schemes for Ukrainian refugees work?
The UK has been widely criticised for not allowing as many Ukrainian refugees to enter as some other European states.
What are the schemes?
Family visa scheme 
The family visa scheme, external is for Ukrainians with a family member in the UK.
That family member must have British nationality, indefinite leave to remain, settled status or proof of permanent residence. 
It was launched at the beginning of March, and extended after criticism that it excluded some close family members. 
Ukrainian refugees are advised to apply at a Visa Application Centre (VAC) in countries including Poland, Romania, Hungary and Moldova. They need to provide biometric information, such as fingerprints. 
Applications from refugees with a Ukrainian passport can be made online, with biometric information provided after arrival in the UK.
As of 7 April, the UK had issued 28,500 visas, external under this scheme from 36,300 applications. However, only 10,800 have arrived in the UK under this scheme so far. 
Ukrainian refugee family thwarted by paperwork
Sponsorship scheme
The ""Homes for Ukraine"", external scheme lets people in the UK host Ukrainians refugees who are known to them, but who do not have family ties here.
It was launched on 14 March, and more than 100,000 people and organisations signed up within the first day.
Under the scheme, people are asked to offer Ukrainians a rent-free space in their home or a separate residence for at least six months. They will not be expected to provide food and living expenses but can choose to do so.
Those offering to host a refugee will be vetted by the government and Ukrainian applicants will undergo security checks.
Each household housing a refugee will be offered £350 a month, tax-free, for up to 12 months. 
Local authorities will also receive £10,500 in extra funding per refugee for support services, with more for children of school age.
However, some families who have applied to be sponsors have complained that the system is overly complicated.
Government figures show that as of 7 April, 12,500 sponsorship visas had been issued, external from 43,600 applications. However, only 1,200 refugees have arrived in the UK so far under the sponsorship visas.

Homes for Ukraine: 'It's sad, slow and frustrating'
Why has the UK government's response been criticised?
The Home Office has been accused of a chaotic and overly-bureaucratic response. 
EU countries are allowing Ukrainian refugees in for up to three years without a visa, and more than four million people have fled to neighbouring countries since the Russian invasion. 
Poland has taken more than 2.5 million refugees, and Romania more than 650,000. As of 7 April, 40,900 UK visas had been issued in total, external, but only 12,000 have reached the UK so far.
On 8 April, Home Secretary  Priti Patel apologised ""with frustration"" for visa delays.
On 26 February, Home Office minister Kevin Foster was widely criticised after highlighting the government's Seasonal Worker visa, which allows people to apply to come to the UK to pick fruit and vegetables. 
His tweet was subsequently deleted. 
There have been complaints that the UK visa process is too complicated - one British man told the BBC it had taken 72 hours to get a visa for his Ukrainian step-daughter, who had fled to Romania.
There have also been reports of refugees who have got as far as Calais, before being turned away by Border Force officials for not having the right paperwork.
Heartless or doing its best to help refugees? UK in crisis mode
On 7 March, Home Secretary Priti Patel told MPs ""we have set up a bespoke VAC en route to Calais"". But the Home Office did not confirm that this was the case.
The government then opened a VAC in Lille on 10 March - around 70 miles away from Calais. 
The Home Office said it would deal with ""a limited number of cases"" - referred to it by Border Force officials - and advised applicants not to travel there. 
Why have so few visas been issued by the government so far?
In addition to the lengthy paperwork refugees must submit to obtain both types of visas, government guidance, external for the Homes for Ukraine scheme states that applicants ""will be subject to a range of checks"". These can include:
a visit from local authorities to ensure that properties are fit for purpose 
basic DBS check if hosts are sponsoring adults 
enhanced DBS check if hosts are sponsoring children under 18 or vulnerable adults.
It is likely that the vetting process will exacerbate what already seems to be a long and complex visa application process. 
Will the UK lift visa rules for Ukrainian refugees?
The government has faced pressure - including from some Conservative MPs - to issue emergency visas or lift visa requirements altogether for Ukrainian refugees.
Home Secretary Priti Patel has ruled this out, insisting that ""security and biometric checks"" were vital to keep British citizens safe.  
The government also says that some people in Calais claiming to be Ukrainians have presented false documents. 
Boris Johnson has defended the current visa rules, saying: ""People want us to be generous but also careful."" 
He has also repeatedly talked about the government's ""proud record"" on refugees since 2015, telling MPs ""we've done more to resettle vulnerable people than any other European country since 2015"". 
However, this only refers to one specific category - ""resettled refugees"". Other European countries have taken in larger numbers of refugees in general.

196,196,Zimbabwe clinics struggle for nurses after exodus to the UK,"Wed, 09 Mar 2022 01:05:08 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-60524576,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-60524576?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,"With large numbers of nurses emigrating, patient care is suffering as there are not enough staff.","Zimbabwe clinics struggle for nurses after exodus to the UK
Health clinics in Zimbabwe are facing a crisis as increasing numbers of nurses leave the country in search of better prospects, as the BBC's Shingai Nyoka writes.
The young woman in a dark green gown was in the throes of labour, her face twisted in pain. 
Still for one minute and then groaning and writhing this way and that in the next. 
I stood at the half-open door peering in, I had permission to be there for a story but felt more like a voyeur, an intruder in a deeply personal moment. 
Two weeks earlier, the acting chief nursing officer for the authorities in the capital, Harare, Perpetua Kaseke, had shown me around this same clinic, the Warren Park Polyclinic. 
She is responsible for the staffing at all the council's health facilities. 
She told me there were only four nurses on duty for the whole clinic, which serves hundreds of people every day.
Two in the maternity wing, one for outpatients and another for family services. Ordinarily they need a minimum of eight.  
While we were talking, a nurse shot past behind me - she was doubling up her duties, covering the labour, delivery and post-delivery wards, as well as helping out in ante-natal care.  
Seeing the pregnant woman - in labour alone in her most vulnerable moment - really crystallised the extent of the problem.  
Matron Kaseke told me that most of her clinics were operating at 50% capacity. I sensed her frustration - nurses are overworked and stressed, she told me, and they keep resigning. 
Twelve nurses left last month alone. 
Most of them are going to the UK or Ireland, others to Zimbabwe's neighbouring countries or to the private sector. 
She said it can be hard to organise staffing from one minute to the next - some only give 24 hours' notice before they leave.   
None of the nurses at the clinic wanted to speak to me, I suspect some are processing their papers and preparing to leave.  
Staff are struggling to cope with the number of patients they now have to see
The UK has been on a recruitment drive for medical professionals to plug its own staff shortages due to the impact of the pandemic and Brexit.  
Zimbabwe has long underpaid its public sector workers. Nurses employed by the city council earn slightly more than those working in government hospitals. 
But in both cases, the nurse on the lowest salary takes home less than $200 (£150) a month, just enough to cover the rent for a two-bedroom house in a low-income neighbourhood, but not much else. And they are fed up.  
The state Health Service Board says that just over 2,200 medical personnel left its services last year alone: 900 of them were nurses. 
This was double the number of staff who left in 2020 and triple that of 2019.  
Matron Kaseke told me that at one point nine of Harare council's 43 clinics had scaled down their operations or been closed completely for lack of staff.   
I visited Matapi Clinic in the district of Mbare. Its doors were shut and covered in cobwebs. 
Mbare is the most densely populated suburb in the capital, and needs these health services.  
A group of men was eager to find out what story I was covering. 
They used to receive medical attention at this clinic, but now must travel longer distances and have to wait for long periods. 
At the nearby clinic that is still operating, staff were struggling to maintain order. 
In the outside waiting area, a boisterous nursing assistant student was taking people's blood pressure. The clinics and hospitals are now taking on more students before they are qualified to cover the gap.  
It wasn't always like this - public health facilities in Zimbabwe were once envied by other sub-Saharan African countries. But they disintegrated due to decades of under-investment. 
In 1992, former first lady Sally Mugabe chose to be treated for kidney failure in a public hospital right up to her death. 
Over 25 years later, it was a different story for her husband: former President Robert Mugabe opted to be treated in a private hospital in Singapore, where he later died, far away from the crumbling public healthcare system of his homeland.

So what's it like for the nurses who do settle in the UK? 
I spoke to one nurse who has been there since last July.
He tells me with a sense of accomplishment that he now earns about 10 times what he did in Harare, even though British nurses have low pay relative to other professions in the UK. 
The money he sends back home goes a long way. He can afford to send his children to boarding schools in Zimbabwe and support relatives in a difficult position. 
He has no plans to return any time soon.

197,197,What is going on with the partygate probe?,"Wed, 09 Mar 2022 01:01:10 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-60620289,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-60620289?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,Stories about Covid rule breaking in No 10 have gone away but police activities are continuing.,"What is going on with the partygate probe?
Before the war in Ukraine, lockdown parties in Downing Street had dominated the news. But while that's no longer the case, much is still going on behind the scenes. 
We've been speaking to some of those being investigated, as well as some of the Tory MPs who may ultimately decide the fate of Boris Johnson, to understand what's happening, and predict what might happen next.
Partygate may have fallen away from the main headlines, but the Metropolitan Police's activities have been continuing under the radar.
Downing Street sources have confirmed more than 80 questionnaires have been received by aides, officials and politicians, asking about the events.
The Covid rules when Downing Street parties were held 
PM sent lockdown party questionnaire by police
How many parties are police investigating?
We have spoken to some of those who attended at least one of the 12 parties being investigated by the police. So far, no-one has said they have received a fixed penalty notice.
The Met has said it will reveal the number of fixed penalty notices it issues, and the nature of the rule breaches. But they haven't said when.
Naturally, some of those who attended parties have been sent questionnaires but, interestingly, some have not. This could mean the police are focusing their investigation on only ""the most serious and flagrant type of breach"", as then Met Police Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick indicated in January.
If that's the case, it may point to a high number of questionnaires turning into fixed penalty notices.
And it's not impossible the number of people caught in the net begins to grow. I'm told, for example, one civil servant who had been working at his desk while colleagues had been drinking was aggrieved to have received a questionnaire while his boss had not.
Whitehall sources have suggested there were fears among some staff that they might receive multiple fines if they attended more than one event under investigation, and some may face higher fines if they are deemed to have organised and not just attended an event.
So even if Mr Johnson isn't himself fined, critics say he may yet face renewed pressure to go if the scale of rule-breaking is, in the words of an ex-cabinet minister, ""industrial"".
It's still not clear when the Met Police will conclude their involvement. But events in Ukraine may be delaying the process. 
Tory MPs 
So what about Tory MPs?  Before the conflict in Ukraine, the prime minister faced political danger. After a raft of allegations about rule-breaking gatherings during lockdowns, a dozen of his own MPs had publicly called for him to go, and more were considering moving against him.
He toured the parliamentary tea rooms, addressed meetings of his restless MPs, and the chatter in the Commons corridors was of little else.
What those Conservative MPs think of him is crucial. If 54 - 15% of the parliamentary party - lose confidence in him, then a vote would be held to determine whether he continues as Conservative leader, and therefore as prime minister.
But this week, a cabinet minister told me the war in Ukraine had changed everything.

Watch: What has Boris Johnson said before about alleged No 10 parties?
Before, speculation about his leadership had almost become ""a self-fulfilling prophecy"", he said. MPs faced with negative headlines might have been tempted to ""lance the boil"" and have a contest to clear the air.
But now, he said, the whole issue was barely mentioned. He believed Mr Johnson's leadership was safe. The cacophony of concern in the Commons corridors has been replaced with sombre silence.
Some MPs who hadn't called for Mr Johnson to go had been preparing to do so if he was fined by the police. 
The prime minister's backers had become increasingly confident that this outcome could be avoided. He can claim No 10 is both his home and his office, blurring any lines between working and socialising. 
But some now think he does not have to escape a fine to survive. Allies are arguing that ""partygate"" has now been put in perspective. One of them described the lockdown gatherings as ""trivial"" by comparison with war. 
Another denounced the rhetoric and self-righteousness of some of Mr Johnson's opponents, adding: ""What is 'sickening' is what Russia is doing in Ukraine, not whether the prime minister got a birthday cake on his birthday.""
An MP, who wants Mr Johnson to go, said a protracted party leadership contest during a crisis was almost unthinkable, in part because there was not an obvious, single candidate - ""no big beast, Hezza-type figure"" - to replace him.
And, significantly, one former minister who had been on the brink of joining calls for the PM to step down, said he had now changed his mind.
""Even if he gets an FPN (a fixed penalty notice fine), those of us who were waiting for evidence of rule-breaking will certainly feel troubled, but we won't go after him."" This was partly due to a feeling is that he has handled the conflict ""OK"". 
Another was more blunt: any attempted putsch during the conflict would backfire, and the prime minister could win a leadership vote, with the pain of a contest for no obvious political gain.
And of course, with attention rightly focussed on Ukraine, even some of Mr Johnson's internal opponents concede that a recovery in the polls could disperse the political storm clouds around him.
Others believe that the underlying political climate hasn't dramatically changed.
Inside Downing Street
Mr Johnson's defence is that he has already begun reforming the way Downing Street is run - that some of the people who organised and attended the controversial events have moved on, or left government entirely - and there is a new chief of staff, a new communications director and new ways of working.
Sue Gray delivered an initial update at the end of January
But the effects of partygate may still have a long tail. I'm told there is resentment among some officials that while the prime minister and senior civil servants have paid for their own legal advice when completing the Met questionnaires, no assistance has been given to those who can't afford to do so.
Some of those who have received questionnaires have been subjected to the highest level of security clearance and genuinely do not know if a fixed penalty notice would mean they couldn't continue in their roles.
And if the prime minister escapes a fine but a whole swathe of more junior staff look like the ""scapegoats"", then that too could be politically difficult - playing to the opposition narrative that there is ""one rule for Boris Johnson and another for everybody else"".
What does Sue Gray's parties report say?
Senior Tories demand full No 10 parties report
The prime minister has returned his questionnaire - but with the focus at the heart of government now on the Ukraine crisis, some officials have asked for an extension to the seven-day window for their responses. And I'm told the Met has granted this.
It is also not clear yet if the process will be elongated if some people challenge the fixed penalty notices they receive in court. 
What's next?
A former cabinet minister has come to the conclusion that ""the longer the whole thing takes, potentially the higher the danger"" for the prime minister.
If a fixed penalty notice were to be issued ""in the next few days"", it would get little traction, he told me, but it could become more toxic if and when coverage of the conflict in Ukraine dips. 
""I'd say he has had a deferral rather than a reprieve,"" the ex-minister said. ""The timescale moves beyond May and maybe even until October, December - depending on events in Ukraine. But the underlying concerns remain.""
Two factors could still damage Mr Johnson's leadership, according to one Conservative rebel.
One MP says he's received more emails about Downing Street parties than Dominic Cummings's (pictured) trip to County Durham
First, public reaction. He doesn't accept the argument that because voters are focused on the suffering in Ukraine, that they have ""forgiven"" the prime minister for partygate - or forgotten it.
""This issue only looks trivial at Westminster. I had a deluge of emails about it in my inbox. Far more than over Dominic Cummings,"" he said - a reference to the PM's former adviser's infamous lockdown trip to County Durham.
So, when an unexpurgated version of the report by the senior civil servant Sue Gray is published, after the police investigation has concluded, this could provide a focus for more public anger, he argues.
But for him, the issue of whether the prime minister receives a fixed penalty notice or not is something of a red herring.
He believes that what may yet bring Mr Johnson down is not attendance at certain gatherings, but whether he has misled Parliament - and breached the ministerial code. The prime minister has been careful in his language.
In December, in the Commons, he told Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer: ""I have been repeatedly assured that the rules were not broken.""
'Lucky'
Now, such caveats may not wash with Mr Johnson's critics. But while the ministerial code states that ""ministers who knowingly mislead Parliament will be expected to offer their resignation"", that resignation would normally be tendered to none other than the prime minister - who ultimately interprets and enforces the code.
Ultimately, whether Mr Johnson remains in office will be a political, not a legal or procedural decision. And, right now, his position feels less precarious than it did.
A former cabinet colleague of Mr Johnson's said that the ""talk in the [House of Commons] tea room is how lucky a politician Boris Johnson has been"".
Then, after a slight pause, he added: ""I remember they once said the same about David Cameron.""
Timeline: Downing St gatherings

The government has faced intense pressure over gatherings held in and around Downing Street during Covid lockdowns. A police investigation into several of the events has now concluded, with more than 100 fines having been issued to attendees. Here is what we know about the gatherings and the restrictions in place at the time:


15 May 2020

A photo from May 2020 showed the prime minister and his staff with bottles of wine and a cheeseboard in the Downing Street garden. When asked about it, Boris Johnson said ""those people were at work talking about work"".
The rules:
Legal restrictions at the time said you could not leave your house without a reasonable excuse and government guidance was that you could meet one person outside of your household in an outdoor setting while exercising.
This event was not investigated by the police.

20 May 2020

About 100 people were invited by email to ""socially distanced drinks in the No 10 garden this evening"". Witnesses told the BBC the PM and his wife were among about 30 people who attended.
Boris Johnson apologised to MPs for attending the event, saying he spent 25 minutes thanking staff, before returning to his office.
The police investigation determined that this event did breach the rules in place at the time.

18 June 2020

A gathering took place in the Cabinet Office to mark the departure of a No 10 private secretary.
The police investigation determined that this event did breach the rules in place at the time.
We know at least one fine has been issued after the government's former head of ethics admitted receiving one and apologised for attending the event.

19 June 2020

On Boris Johnson’s birthday, up to 30 people gathered in the Cabinet Room at No 10 to present the prime minister with a birthday cake and sing Happy Birthday, according to a report by ITV News.
No 10 said staff had ""gathered briefly"" to ""wish the prime minister a happy birthday"", adding that he had been there ""for less than 10 minutes"".
The rules:
Restrictions at the time banned most indoor gatherings involving more than two people.
The police investigation determined that this event did breach the rules in place at the time.
We know at least three attendees have received fines from the police, with the PM, his wife Carrie Symonds and Chancellor Rishi Sunak all confirming they have paid fixed penalty notices.

13 November 2020

Two gatherings are understood to have taken place in Downing Street on this date: one to mark the departure of a special adviser and one in the Downing Street flat.
According to a report in the Daily Telegraph, the gathering in the flat where Mr Johnson and his wife live was to celebrate the departure of Dominic Cummings, the PM's former senior adviser. A spokesman for Mrs Johnson denies the party took place.
The rules:
Eight days earlier Boris Johnson had announced a new lockdown in England. Indoor gatherings with other households were banned, unless they were for work purposes.
The police investigation determined that an event on this date did breach the rules in place at the time but they have not confirmed whether it was one or both of the events.

27 November 2020

A leaving event was held for No 10 aide, Cleo Watson, where people were drinking, and Mr Johnson made a speech, according to sources.
This event was not investigated by the police.

10 December 2020

The Department for Education has confirmed it had an office gathering to thank staff for their work during the pandemic. It says drinks and snacks were brought by those who attended and no outside guests or support staff were invited.
The rules:
Eight days earlier, London had been placed in restrictions which banned two or more people from different households from meeting indoors, unless ""reasonably necessary"" for work purposes.
This event was not investigated by the police.

14 December 2020

The Conservative Party has admitted that an ""unauthorised gathering"" took place at its HQ in Westminster. It was held by the team of the party's London-mayoral candidate, Shaun Bailey, who has since stepped down as chair of the London Assembly police and crime committee.
In December, police said they would be contacting two people who attended the party.
This event was not included in Sue Gray's report.

15 December 2020

Multiple sources have told the BBC there was a Christmas quiz for No 10 staff last year. A photo - published by the Sunday Mirror - shows Boris Johnson taking part and sitting between two colleagues in No 10. Mr Johnson has denied any wrongdoing.
The rules: At this time, the rules in London banned two or more people from different households from meeting indoors, unless ""reasonably necessary"" for work purposes.
This event was not investigated by the police.

16 December 2020

The Department for Transport has apologised after confirming reports of a party in its offices, calling it ""inappropriate"" and an ""error of judgment"" by staff.
This event was not included in Sue Gray's report.

17 December 2020

A leaving party was held at the Cabinet Office for the outgoing head of the civil service Covid taskforce - the team responsible for drawing up coronavirus restrictions.
Kate Josephs, now chief executive of Sheffield City Council, apologised for the event, saying she was ""truly sorry that I did this and for the anger that people will feel as a result"".
A second gathering was held in the Cabinet Office to hold an online Christmas quiz for the Cabinet Secretary’s private office.
A third gathering was held in No 10 Downing Street to mark the departure of a No 10 official
The police investigation determined that an event on this date did breach the rules in place at the time but they have not confirmed whether it was one or all of the events.

18 December 2020

Downing Street originally denied a report by the Daily Mirror that a party took place in Downing Street on this date.
However, a video obtained by ITV News showed the prime minister's then-press secretary Allegra Stratton joking about reports of the event, saying: ""This fictional party was a business meeting and it was not socially distanced.""
The police investigation determined that this event did breach the rules in place at the time.

14 January 2021

A gathering was held in No 10 Downing Street to mark the departure of two private secretaries.
The police investigation determined that this event did breach the rules in place at the time.

16 April 2021

Two parties were held by Downing Street staff at No 10, the night before Prince Philip's funeral.
One of the events was a leaving party for the PM's then director of communications James Slack, who has apologised for the event and acknowledged it ""should not have happened at the time that it did"".
Boris Johnson was not at either party.
The rules
The rules had been eased in England on 12 April, but working from home continued to be recommended and socialising indoors with people from other households was not allowed. Meeting others outdoors was limited to groups of six people or two households.
The police investigation determined that an event on this date did breach the rules in place at the time but they have not confirmed whether it was one or both of the events.
We know fines have been issued to some people who attended Mr Slack’s leaving party, but we do not know who they were issued to.

Dropped catches cost England in shock defeat by Windies
Women's World Cup, Dunedin
West Indies 225-6 (50 overs): Campbelle 66, Nation 49*, Ecclestone 3-20
England 218 all out (47.4 overs): Beaumont 46, Connell 3-38
West Indies won by seven runs
Scorecard. Table
England engineered their own downfall in a damaging seven-run defeat by West Indies at the Women's World Cup in Dunedin.
The defending champions missed six chances in the field, conceded 23 runs in wides, then made a mess of chasing 226 for their second loss in as many games.
They were given hope by a ninth-wicket stand of 61 between Kate Cross and Sophie Ecclestone, only for Cross to be run out backing-up for 27.
That left nine to win and, one run later, number 11 Anya Shrubsole was bowled by Anisa Mohammed to give West Indies their first win over England at the World Cup. 
West Indies had earlier been reduced from 81-0 to 98-4, before a stand of 123 between Shemaine Campbelle and Chedean Nation lifted them to 225-6.
And, even though West Indies dropped three catches of their own, they ultimately squeezed England for a famous win.
With the top four from the eight-team group going through to the semi-finals, England's defence of the trophy they won in 2017 is far from over, but they now have little margin for error.
Their next game is against South Africa in Tauranga on Monday.
West Indies add this scalp to their victory over hosts New Zealand and are in a strong position for a tilt on the semi-finals.

Winfield-Hill drops Dottin first ball
For all of the positives England took from falling only 12 runs short of chasing 311 in their opening game against Australia, the mistakes they made with the ball and in the field in that match were repeated in Dunedin.
Lauren Winfield-Hill dropped Deandra Dottin from the first ball of the match.
With Hayley Matthews also put down twice, West Indies' openers were able to add 81.
England were at least able to fight back, chiefly through the left-arm spinner Ecclestone, who removed Matthews and Stafanie Taylor, either side of Dottin being run out as three wickets fell in the same over.
However, after Kycia Knight chipped Ecclestone to short cover, Campbelle and Nation took advantage of more England mistakes to rebuild the West Indies innings.
Nation was dropped by Shrubsole on 23 and should have been run out for 24, only for wicketkeeper Amy Jones to drop the ball.
Campbelle overturned being given lbw to Heather Knight on seven and was put down by Shrubsole on 55.
Facing what would have been their highest successful chase in a World Cup match, England struggled on a wearing pitch.
From 94-5, they were first revived by a stand of 60 between Danni Wyatt and Sophia Dunkley then, after three wickets fell for two runs, the composure of Cross and Ecclestone.
With the finish line in sight, it was cruel for Cross to be run out when Ecclestone's drive hit Mohammed's fingers en route to the non-striker's stumps, with Cross out of her ground.
Three balls later, England were beaten.
What can England do to improve?
These opening World Cup defeats follow an Ashes series where England went winless against Australia.
Their top-order batting is reliant on the trio of Knight, Nat Sciver - who both failed in Dunedin - and Tammy Beaumont, who was dropped on six before making 46.
Opener Winfield-Hill is without a half-century since 2016 and has been backed over Emma Lamb, the only batting reserve in the squad. Wicketkeeper Jones looks bereft of confidence with the bat and could drop below Dunkley and Wyatt in the order.
Of greater concern is the unforced errors with the ball and in the field.
The missed chances are immeasurably costly, while their first two games have seen England concede 21 and 23 runs to wides respectively, with the defeats coming by margins of 12 and seven runs.

'An unbelievable piece of athleticism' Dottin takes sensational catch
If West Indies' win over New Zealand was a surprise, this was a huge shock, but one that came from resilience and determination.
They could have imploded when losing four wickets for 17 runs - including three for nought - but Campbelle, with 66, and Nation's 49 not out dragged them to a winning total with patience, control and intelligence.
West Indies had their own problems with drops and wides, but in Dottin they have perhaps the best fielder in the world and she pulled of a spectacular, gravity defying catch to hold Winfield-Hill in one hand, diving to her left.
And, when Cross and Ecclestone were edging closer, West Indies held their nerve, with Shrubsole's wicket sparking joyous celebrations from the women in maroon.
'We've got to be better'
England captain Heather Knight: ""The fielding performance wasn't us. We're not too concerned, but there's a bit of frustration. There's a lot we could have done differently. We've got to be better as a fielding group.""
West Indies captain Stafanie Taylor: ""It's not something that I like, it was a bit nerve-wracking for me but I'm really glad that we came out on the good side. We had to bowl really well and field well, I think we did that in patches. We need to look at that and be as consistent as we can.""
Former England spinner Alex Hartley on Test Match Special: ""That's not good enough. Things have got to change. England should be really disappointed with themselves.""

'Not over the moon, but really happy we went through'
Jurgen Klopp said Liverpool deserve to be in the Champions League quarter-finals despite some ""slapstick"" finishing as they were beaten by Inter Milan in the second leg of their last-16 tie at Anfield.
An outstanding finish by Lautaro Martinez was not enough for the Italian champions as the late goals by Roberto Firmino and Mohamed Salah in the first leg in Milan three weeks ago proved decisive.
""The art of football is to lose the right games,"" said manager Klopp after Liverpool's seven-match winning run in Europe this season came to a disappointing end. 
""I still hate it, but if there was any game we could have afforded to lose it was this one because the main target of this competition is to get through.
""It's not that I am over the moon - I'm really happy we went through, because when we saw the draw it was 'OK, that's a tough one'. But we went through over two legs and I think we deserved it.
""It's a big 'if' but if we had used our chances from set-pieces and other situations - it was a bit slapstick how we missed the chances - in the end we could still have won the game.
""But the only thing I'm interested in is that it is fair we are through.""
Reaction from Anfield and Tuesday's Champions League games
Go straight to all the best Liverpool content
Martinez gave Alisson no chance with an arrowed finish from 20 yards in the 61st minute.
But Inter's hopes of forcing extra time with a second goal faded when former Arsenal and Manchester United forward Alexis Sanchez was sent off just two minutes later for a second yellow card.
Liverpool hit the woodwork three times in a bad-tempered game which, in addition to Sanchez's red card, saw six other players booked.
After Joel Matip headed against the bar, Salah struck the post twice in front of the Kop. 
The draw for the last eight takes place on 18 March in Nyon, Switzerland.
The game was also stopped for a few minutes in the first half due to a medical emergency in the crowd.
Relief as Reds progress
There was a sense of relief around Anfield at full-time after Liverpool suffered a scare before booking their place in the last eight.
The Reds were far from their best, but looked in control of the tie until Martinez's excellent strike, and Sanchez's dismissal then gave the hosts fresh momentum.
A first defeat of 2022, after a terrific run in which they have delivered a trophy with the EFL Cup, will serve as a reminder to Klopp that there is still work to do if they are to end the season with more success.
Having scored 109 goals in their previous 43 games, this was a rare occasion they failed to find the net.
Liverpool did everything but score, though, as they rattled the bar and post, while substitute Luis Diaz was denied at point-blank range in the dying stages by Arturo Vidal's block.
One positive for Klopp was the performance of Trent Alexander-Arnold, who seems to get better and better the longer the season goes on.
He was at the heart of all his side's best moves and went close to scoring from a free-kick at the end of the first half.
First home defeat for a year
This defeat came almost a year to the day since Liverpool's last defeat at Anfield.
Mario Lemina scored the only goal to give relegation-threatened Fulham a surprise away win on 7 March 2021.
Liverpool had gone 28 games unbeaten at home - winning 21 and drawing seven - before Inter's first victory over the Reds since 1965.
Despite the loss, Klopp's men have now reached the Champions League quarter-final stage for the fourth time in the last five seasons.

200,200,Bairstow ton rescues England against West Indies,"Tue, 08 Mar 2022 22:41:57 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/cricket/60665827,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/cricket/60665827?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,Jonny Bairstow's hundred rescues England after another batting collapse on day one of the first Test against West Indies in Antigua.,"England in West Indies: Jonny Bairstow's brilliant century rescues tourists in Antigua
Bairstow's hundred was his eighth in his 81st Test
First Test, Sir Vivian Richards Stadium, Antigua (day one):
England 268-6: Bairstow 109*, Foakes 42; Holder 2-15
West Indies: Yet to bat
Scorecard
Jonny Bairstow's sensational hundred rescued England after their new era began with a familiar batting collapse on day one of the first Test against West Indies in Antigua.
Bairstow came in at 48-4 and hit 109 not out, his second ton in as many Tests, to steer England to 268-6 at the close.
He put on 67 with Ben Stokes and 99 with Ben Foakes, who made a composed 42 on his recall to the team.
In their first Test since their humiliating 4-0 Ashes defeat, England lost four wickets in the first session, including captain Joe Root - bowled by Kemar Roach for 13.
Alex Lees made just four on debut while Zak Crawley nicked behind for eight to follow his fellow opener in departing inside four overs.
But Bairstow showed great application before becoming increasingly aggressive as West Indies lost their discipline and tired late in the day. 
He shared an unbeaten stand of 54 with Chris Woakes to reach the close unbeaten, Woakes ending 24 not out.
On a slow pitch Bairstow's knock put his side in a decent position, one that looked out of reach earlier in the day, as they look to move on from their Ashes fallout and a run of one win in 14 Tests.
TMS podcast: Bairstow's brilliance, Sir Viv's 70th & Lee on Warne
England in West Indies 2022
Bairstow rescues 'new' England
All of the talk in the lead-up to this three-Test series has been of England's ""red-ball reset"". 
Former head coach Chris Silverwood departed last month and record-breaking bowling pair James Anderson and Stuart Broad have been left out. But when the top order wilted once again, England were in a situation that became all-too-common during the Ashes.
They made six changes from the final Ashes Test defeat in Hobart but it was Bairstow, a 32-year-old playing his 81st Test, who stood-up when his side looked like plunging further.
After being recalled for the third Test in Australia, Bairstow hit the only England century of the series a match later in Sydney before missing the final Test through injury. This century was every bit as impressive as that courageous knock in the drawn Test at the SCG.
Bairstow has scored centuries in three consecutive matches when including his 106 not out in the warm-up match in Antigua
The only scare came on 59 when he was given out caught behind off left-arm spinner Veerasammy Permaul, but an immediate review saw him reprieved, having clearly missed it.
He took 128 balls to reach 50 but only another 62 to go to his eighth Test hundred, attacking the increasing amount of width on offer.
After Stokes was bowled by 20-year-old seamer Jayden Seales for a scratchy 36, it was the partnership between Bairstow and Foakes that swung the day in England's favour.
Wicketkeeper Foakes looked impressively assured until getting a delivery from Jason Holder that kept a little low and trapped him lbw.
The day will be remembered for Bairstow's knock - an innings that could prove crucial in halting the downward spiral of this England side.
Another top-order collapse
Joe Root scored 1,708 runs in 15 Tests in 2021
That spiral only looked like continuing after another dismal top-order display.
Lees was perhaps unfortunate. The 28-year-old Durham left-hander was set-up brilliantly by Roach to be trapped lbw from round the wicket - a decision that was upheld on review but a close umpire's call on impact.
But opening partner Crawley played an awful, loose drive and was superbly caught off an inside edge one-handed by wicket-keeper Joshua da Silva diving to his left.
Having promoted himself to number three in this new line-up, Root made a rare error and was bowled leaving a ball that nipped back from Roach, while Dan Lawrence, recalled to bat number four, poked to offer a catch to second slip on 20, having previously looked settled.
England ended the first session of their new era 57-4.
Experienced pair Roach and Holder, who bowled five overs without conceding a run before lunch, were excellent in the first session but youngsters Seales and Alzarri Joseph offered too many boundary balls afterwards, spoiling West Indies' fine start.
Holder also put down Woakes on nought - a tough diving chance at slip off Joseph - and the slow surface saw other edges fall short of fielders.
'It feels amazing' - reaction
BBC cricket correspondent Jonathan Agnew: ""England are definitely back in the match thanks to Stokes, Bairstow and Foakes, with a flourish at the end from Woakes.
""West Indies will be disappointed they couldn't take a wicket with the new ball before the close.""
England batter Jonny Bairstow: ""I am very passionate about playing Test cricket. I am absolutely delighted. It has been a good start to the year and hopefully that can continue.
""It is going to be an interesting one tomorrow morning. It will be a big morning session. We would like to push on to 320-350. Anything from there is a bonus from the start we had. If you look too far ahead you can very quickly come up short.""
West Indies all-rounder Jason Holder: ""Jonny played really well and brought England right back into the game. We had a really good start with the new ball, but it was slow going after that. The wicket got a lot better. 
""If I am being critical we leaked too many boundaries. We need to make the second new ball count.""

201,201,Lewandowski scores earliest Champions League hat-trick as Bayern hit seven,"Tue, 08 Mar 2022 23:04:53 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/60667847,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/60667847?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,Robert Lewandowski scores the earliest ever Champions League hat-trick as Bayern Munich thrash Red Bull Salzburg 6-2 on aggregate to reach the quarter-finals.,"Bayern Munich 7-1 FC Red Bull Salzburg (8-2 agg): Hosts thrash Austrians to advance into last eight
Only Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo have scored more goals for a single team in the Champions League than Robert Lewandowski
Robert Lewandowski scored a hat-trick inside the opening 23 minutes as Bayern Munich thrashed Red Bull Salzburg to reach the Champions League quarter-finals.
The Poland captain, on his 100th start in the competition, confidently stroked home two penalties inside 21 minutes, after twice being recklessly brought down by Salzburg defender Maximilian Wober, the second confirmed after a VAR review.
The first spot-kick, swept into the bottom-left corner, was Lewandowski's 40th goal of the season in all competitions.
He added his third after chasing down an attempted clearance from visiting goalkeeper Philipp Kohn to tap in from close range. 
It is the first time a Champions League hat-trick has been completed as early as the 23rd minute, although it is not the quickest treble in the competition, with that record held by Bafetimbi Gomis following his three goals in eight minutes for Lyon in a 7-1 win over Dinamo Zagreb in 2011.
Bayern's quick start put them firmly in control of a game that had been billed as ""all or nothing"" by some in the Bavarian media after the six-time winners were held to a disappointing 1-1 draw in the first leg in Austria.
Matthias Jaissle's Salzburg had early chances with Nicolas Capaldo and Nicolas Seiwald both guilty of failing to convert glorious opportunities. 
They were made to pay for their profligacy by the deadly Lewandowski before another mistake in defence allowed Serge Gnabry to add a fourth with a low shot that squirmed under Kohn, while Thomas Muller thumped in a fifth after the break. 
On an otherwise bleak night for the visitors Maurits Kjaergaard did at least mange a consolation with a powerful effort into the top-left corner. 
But that only seemed to stir Julian Nagelsmann's team back into life, with Muller finishing off a well-worked move for number six before Leroy Sane thumped home late on.
Relive Tuesday's Champions League action
Lewandowski masterclass inspires Bayern
Much had been made of Bayern's defensive vulnerabilities after they only scraped a late draw in the first leg, and Salzburg appeared to have real hope of becoming the first Austrian team to reach the last eight of this competition since 1985.
But when it came to it they simply had no answer to a masterclass at the Allianz Arena, with Lewandowski the catalyst for a simple yet ruthless night's work by the hosts. 
The 33-year-old twice outfoxed Wober to set the tone for the second leg and his third - as he reached 85 Champions League goals in three fewer matches than Lionel Messi and 17 before Cristiano Ronaldo - was all about his determination to keep going. 
After Ronaldo (seven) and Messi (five), Lewandowski is now only the third player to score 10 or more goals in three or more different Champions League campaigns.
And not content to rest on his laurels after becoming the top scorer in this season's competition, Lewandowski was also involved in Muller's second before teeing up Sane for Bayern's seventh of the night.

Andy Murray has pledged to donate his prize-money earnings for the rest of the year to help children affected by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
The British former world number one is working with Unicef to provide medical supplies and development kits.
Russia's attack on Ukraine has so far seen more than two million people flee the country.
""Over 7.5 million children are at risk with the escalating conflict in Ukraine,"" said Murray, external, 34.
The three-time Grand Slam winner, who is an ambassador for Unicef UK, added: ""It's vital education continues, so Unicef is working to enable access to learning for displaced children, as well as supporting the rehabilitation of damaged schools, together with replacement equipment and furniture.""
Earlier on Tuesday, tennis' governing bodies announced a donation of $700,000 (£530,000) to help humanitarian efforts in Ukraine and support the Ukraine Tennis Federation.

The Football Association of Wales has sold out Cardiff City Stadium for their World Cup play-off semi-final against Austria and potential final against Scotland or Ukraine
Wales' World Cup play-off semi-final against Austria will go ahead this month despite the postponement of Scotland v Ukraine.
The winners of the two ties were due to face each other on 29 March for a place at Qatar 2022.
Fifa has accepted Ukraine's request to push back their tie in Glasgow following Russia's invasion of their country.
However, Wales' game with Austria will be staged as planned on 24 March.
""The FAW supports Fifa's decision in this matter and stands in solidarity with Ukraine and reiterates its condemnation for the use of force and the atrocities being committed by Russia,"" the Football Association of Wales said in a statement.
If Robert Page's side win, the Wales manager will then have to wait several months before knowing who they will face - and when - for a place in Qatar 2022 later this year.
Discussions are under way over a new date for Scotland versus Ukraine, with the Nations League window in June the most likely option.
The final could then also take place shortly after, though Wales are currently due to host both Belgium and the Netherlands this summer in addition to trips to Rotterdam and Poland.
""Alternative fixtures for teams in the March window are being explored by the relevant parties.,"" Fifa said in a statement.
""Similarly, the details of rescheduled fixtures will be announced in due course and the international match calendar window of June will be adapted as necessary for the teams concerned once these details have been finalised.""
Last week FAW chief executive Noel Mooney said they would do whatever the could to show solidarity with Ukraine.
""We are a football family at the Football Association of Wales. We love football but we're also socially conscious as well,"" said Mooney.
""Like anybody else we're appalled and disgusted by what's happening right now with the Russian invasion of Ukraine.""
The World Cup finals take place from 21 November to 18 December and the the draw for the tournament is scheduled for Friday, 1 April in Doha.

205,205,Russia could launch chemical attack in Ukraine - White House,"Thu, 10 Mar 2022 03:47:54 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-60683248,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-60683248?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,"False claims about chemical weapon development are a Russian ploy to justify more attacks, says Jen Psaki.","Russia could launch chemical attack in Ukraine - White House
Russia has been shelling Ukrainian cities, including Irpin, near the capital Kyiv
Russia could be planning a chemical or biological weapon attack in Ukraine - and ""we should all be on the lookout"", the White House has said.
Press secretary Jen Psaki said Russia's claims about US biological weapon labs, and chemical weapon development in Ukraine, were preposterous.
She called the false claims an ""obvious ploy"" to try to justify further premeditated, unprovoked attacks.
It comes after Western officials shared similar concerns about fresh attacks.
They said they were ""very concerned"" about the risk the war could escalate, and particularly the possibility of Russia using non-conventional weapons. 
This most likely refers to chemical weapons although the term also covers tactical (small-scale) nuclear weapons, biological weapons and dirty bombs.
""We've got good reason to be concerned,"" said one Western official.
They said this was partly because of what had been seen in other places where Russia has been engaged - notably Syria where chemical weapons were used by its allies.
Ms Psaki said: ""We should all be on the lookout for Russia to possibly use chemical or biological weapons in Ukraine, or to create a false flag operation using them - it's a clear pattern.""
Earlier on Wednesday, the UK Ministry of Defence said in a tweet, external that Russia had used thermobaric rockets in Ukraine. These rockets are also known as vacuum bombs because they suck in oxygen from the surrounding air to generate a high-temperature explosion.
This makes them more devastating than conventional explosives of a similar size, and can have a terrible impact on people caught in their blast radius.
In a subsequent update, the ministry said it was likely ""experienced mercenaries"" from Russian private military companies associated with the Kremlin were deploying to fight in Ukraine.
The update added Russian mercenaries have been accused of committing human rights abuses in Africa and the Middle East, including in Syria, Libya and the Central African Republic.

The fears around chemical weapon use were borne from Russian claims potentially ""setting the scene"" for some kind of ""false flag"" claim, Western officials said.
In a tweet, external, the Russian Embassy referred to claims that ""recently found documents"" showed components of biological weapons were made in Ukrainian laboratories - with funding from the US Department of Defense. 
The US dismissed the claims, saying it was the ""kind of disinformation operation we've seen repeatedly from the Russians over the years in Ukraine and in other countries"".
Russian officials and media have also claimed in recent days that Ukraine was planning to build a so-called dirty bomb - which disperses radioactive material.
Meanwhile Russia's foreign minister has claimed Ukraine had been seeking nuclear weapons. 
Some believe Moscow is pushing these claims to come up with a justification for its own public about why it invaded Ukraine. But Western officials also fear they could be used as the basis for a ""false flag"" event.
For example, Russia could claim any dispersal of non-conventional weapons came from Ukrainian facilities or troops, or they were used first by Ukraine. That could justify, for Moscow, the subsequent use of non-conventional weapons by Russia.
The Western official said similar stories had come from Russia before their use in Syria.
There were ""other indications as well"", they said - likely referring to some kind of intelligence. ""It's a serious concern for us.""
Russia's ally, the Assad government, used chemical weapons in Syria on multiple occasions against civilians. 
Russia is also accused of using nerve agents - a type of chemical weapon - in attempted assassinations like that of Sergei Skripal in Salisbury in 2018 and against opposition figure Alexei Navalny in Russia in 2020.
The global watchdog that oversees the Chemical Weapons Convention - the OPCW - describes a chemical weapon as a chemical used to cause intentional death or harm through its toxic properties., external
Their use is banned under international humanitarian law regardless of a valid military target because their effects are indiscriminate by nature and designed to cause superfluous injury and unnecessary suffering.

Ukrainians with passports will be able to apply for UK visas online from Tuesday - Priti Patel
Ukrainian refugees who have passports will be able to apply for UK visas online from Tuesday, says Priti Patel.
The move has been done with the approval of the security services, the home secretary told MPs.
It will only apply to people applying under the scheme where they can join family members already in the UK. 
The speed of the UK's response has been criticised, with Labour's Yvette Cooper calling it a ""total disgrace"".
Ms Patel said those applying online would be able to give their biometric data, such as fingerprints, once in the UK - allowing visa application centres to focus on those without passports. 
No further details were given about how a second scheme for refugees, in which people and organisations could sponsor Ukrainians to come to the UK, would work or when it would begin. 
It had been suggested that the family scheme might be expanded to include relatives of people in the UK on temporary visas but this was not addressed by the home secretary in the Commons.
But the Foreign Office has confirmed, external that all Ukrainian staff working for the British embassy and British Council in Ukraine plus their dependents are also able to come to the UK.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson said it was right that the UK should have ""an offer as generous as possible"" that was ""as light touch as possible"" for refugees, but said it remained important to have checks. 
He said ""more than 1,000"" visas had been issued but added that number would ""climb very steeply"".
Meanwhile, a UK charity appeal for Ukraine has raised £120m in less than a week. The Disasters Emergency Committee - made up of a group of UK aid charities - said the level of donations is second only to the response to the Boxing Day earthquake and tsunami in 2004.
UK Home Office in crisis mode over Ukrainian visas
Ukraine: Does the Home Office need to get a grip?
How does the UK's visa scheme for Ukrainians work?
Ms Patel said the new ""streamlined approach"" to visas would make the application process ""quicker and simpler"" but that the Ukrainians with passports can apply for visas online digital system would still allow ""important checks"" to be done.
Speaking about the issue of security, Ms Patel said the Salisbury poisonings in 2018 had showed what Russian President Vladimir Putin was ""willing to do on our soil"" and demonstrated that ""a small number of people with evil intentions can wreak havoc on our streets"".
MPs who had been pushing the government to go further and faster have called the change progress - but many are anxious for more details of the second sponsorship scheme to take in Ukrainians without family in the UK. 
An announcement on this may not come until Monday, BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said.
Shadow home secretary Ms Cooper asked why it had taken ""being hauled into the House of Commons to make basic changes to help vulnerable people who are fleeing from Ukraine?""
She also questioned why there had been a delay when the home secretary had ""had intelligence for weeks, if not months, that she needed to prepare for a Russian invasion of Ukraine"".

Yvette Cooper on the Home Office response to Ukrainian refugees: “Our country is better than this”
During a visit to the Tapa military base in Estonia, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the Home Office approach to visas had been a ""complete shambles that is diminishing our reputation across the world"".
He later told BBC Radio 5 Live the Home Office was ""chopping and changing"" policies and ""making it harder"" for refugees to reach the UK.
Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has written to Mr Johnson urging him to do what the EU has done and waive all visa requirements for any Ukrainian nationals. Poland alone has taken in nearly 1.3 million people so far.
Earlier Ukraine's ambassador to the UK, Vadym Pystaiko, said refugees must not face bureaucratic hurdles, adding that most refugees did not pose a threat. 
Pop-up visa application centre opening
From Phil Mackie in Arras, France
The Préfecture du Pas-de-Calais has announced where the ""pop-up"" visa processing centre for Ukrainian refugees will be. 
There had been reports it would be in Lille, but it's in Arras in France, which is one hour from Calais, two from Brussels and three from Paris. 
Although the UK government had promised that it would be open for several days, it still isn't, but the French authorities say it will be by Friday. 
Many of the hundreds of Ukrainians who are in northern France have spent the past week travelling to the French and Belgian capitals to submit biometric information and documentation. 
Many have already been processed and it's thought most will be by next Tuesday, when the process becomes simpler and will move online.
Meanwhile, the UK has announced sanctions against seven more Russian oligarchs including Chelsea FC owner Roman Abramovich.
How many people have fled Ukraine? 
At UK visa centre in Poland: 'There could be riots'
More than two million people have fled Ukraine since Russia invaded, and the Home Office has come under pressure to speed up visa processing.
Armed Forces Minister James Heappey told BBC Breakfast the Ministry of Defence had offered to assist the Home Office with the visa process, although the countries where application centres are set up would have to approve British troops being sent to help.
The decision to allow Ukrainians with an identity document to apply online for a visa to join family members in the UK is significant.  
It means that from next week many refugees escaping the war and heading for Britain will not have to go to a visa application centre or VAC.
Allowing them to complete biometric tests in the UK after they arrive will reduce the pressure on stretched facilities in Poland, Hungary and elsewhere in Europe.
Biometrics required as part of a UK visa application include fingerprints and a photograph of the applicant's face.
However, the new rules will still exclude anyone who fled without their passport or identity document. They will have to go to a VAC in person. The rules also exclude Ukrainian residents who are not citizens of Ukraine.

Speaking on BBC One's Question Time, Mr Prystaiko pointed out that most of those trying to get to the UK were women with children who were not posing a terrorist threat and said he hoped ""every bureaucratic red tape should be cancelled"".
Elsewhere, Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi said plans were under way to prepare for up to 100,000 Ukrainian children who might need places in UK schools.

Luke Morgan has spent the last week trying to get hold of visas for his wife's family - travelling to Calais, Brussels and then Paris in an effort to fill out the necessary paperwork and provide biometric data.
Visas were finally granted on Wednesday for his wife's parents, sister and two nephews and the group set off for Calais right away after getting the visas.
The refugee crisis has escalated rapidly in recent days as Russia ramped up bombardments of civilian areas in cities. 
On Wednesday, an air strike hit a maternity and children's ward at a hospital in the southern city of Mariupol.
The UK government's response to the refugee crisis has also been branded a ""disgrace"" by Tory MP Alec Shelbrooke, while fellow Conservative politician Sir Roger Gale called on Ms Patel to resign over the situation.

207,207,War in Ukraine: Oil prices plunge as UAE supports supply boost,"Thu, 10 Mar 2022 05:38:22 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-60680787,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-60680787?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,The move could ease a supply crunch as the West and allies shun Russian oil.,"Ukraine war: Oil price rises again due to fears over Russian shortfall
Oil prices rose on Thursday amid confusion over whether major producers would help to plug a gap in supplies from Russia.
The United Arab Emirates had appeared to push members of the Opec producer group to raise output, only for the UAE's energy minister to quash hopes.
The oil price rose more than 5%, after a 17% fall on Wednesday.
""To suggest the oil market is confused would be an understatement,"" said analyst Stephen Innes.
US President Joe Biden and other leaders have pledged to try to ease the price pressures for households. Officials from the US have been in talks with oil producers aimed at boosting supply.
""We favour production increases and will be encouraging Opec to consider higher production levels,"" Ambassador Yousuf Al Otaiba said in a statement, external tweeted by the UAE Embassy in Washington.
But the energy minister Minister Suhail al-Mazrouei said later that the Gulf state remained committed to the existing Opec monthly output agreement, which fixes how much crude is produced by member countries.
Oil prices have jumped more than 30% since 24 February, touching $139 (£105) a barrel at one point this week.  The oil price had fallen back to about $106 a barrel at one point on Wednesday, but by Thursday morning it was trading at around $116.
Could the world survive without Russian oil and gas?
On Tuesday, German Economy Minister Robert Habeck issued an ""urgent appeal"" to Opec oil producers to increase output ""to create relief on the market"".
Saudi Arabia-led Opec and an extended group of oil producers called Opec+ - which includes Russia - have agreed to avoid a price war and keep control over the market.
Mr Innes, managing partner of SPI Asset Management, said: ""To suggest the oil market is confused would be an understatement as we are in an unprecedented situation.""
Commonwealth Bank commodities analyst Vivek Dhar said: ""We think it will be challenging for Opec+ to boost production in this environment."" 
Worries about oil and gas supplies have led to soaring domestic heating bills and fuel prices at the pump. Both petrol and diesel prices hit new records in the UK on Wednesday, according to the RAC motoring group.
Unleaded petrol was 159.57p a litre on average, while diesel was 167.37p. 
Analysis:
By Sameer Hashmi, Middle East business correspondent
Despite the mixed messages coming out from the UAE, there is a broad consensus within Opec+ that there is no immediate need to boost oil production faster. So, even if the UAE tries to convince other members to increase production during the next meeting, it will be difficult to find many backers. 
While Abu Dhabi is a prominent member of Opec+, Riyadh and Moscow are the leaders of the pack and they are the ones who call the shots. Any decision to increase supplies will essentially boil down to Saudi Arabia.
While the UAE is keen to increase production, it is very unlikely that it will break ranks and pump more oil unilaterally.  Both the Saudis and the Emiratis have maintained a neutral stance during the course of this war, and the former would be unwilling to take any decision related to Opec+ that the Russians would oppose.
Opec+ has attributed the recent rise in prices to market volatility caused by geopolitical tensions and maintained that there is no shortage of supplies in the market.
RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said: ""A tank of petrol is now almost £88 while diesel has now gone over £92. Diesel unfortunately appears to be on a clear path to £1.70 a litre.
""As this is an average price, drivers will be seeing some unbelievably high prices on forecourts as retailers pass on their increased wholesale costs.""
Energy prices have been soaring for more than a year amid a rapid rebound in demand for oil, which had collapsed during the pandemic.
Russia's invasion of Ukraine added new price pressures, as sanctions make it hard for the country - typically the producer of about 7% of global supplies -  to find buyers for its oil. 
The US and Canada have also announced bans on Russian oil imports, while the UK said it would phase them out by the end of the year.
The International Energy Agency (IEA) recently agreed to release 60 million barrels of oil from strategic national reserves, but that move is not enough to respond to the recent run-up in prices.
The agency said on Wednesday that oil reserves may be tapped further.
""If there's a need, if our governments decide so, we can bring more oil to the markets, as one part of the response,"" said IEA chief Faith Birol.

Russia's invasion of Ukraine shows that ""the era of complacency"" is over, the Foreign Secretary Liz Truss warned in a speech in Washington DC.
Addressing a think tank, Ms Truss said aggression, such as that shown by Vladimir Putin, can never again be allowed to ""grow unchecked"".
She also called for more defence spending and an end to dependence on ""hostile and authoritarian states"".
The West has reacted to Russia's invasion with a range of sanctions.
On Tuesday, the US and UK announced a ban on Russian oil, while the EU said it would end its reliance on Russian gas.
The same governments have frozen the assets of wealthy Russians believed to have links with Mr Putin.
In a tweet,, external Boris Johnson said he had spoken to Ukraine's President Zelensky, and that the UK would tighten sanctions to ""impose the maximum economic cost on Russia"" and increase military support to Ukraine.
West hits Russia with oil bans and gas curbs 
Giving the Makins lecture to the Atlantic Council think tank, Ms Truss said countries need to introduce further sanctions - including banning Russia completely from using the international payment system, Swift and freezing all Russian banking assets.
She said all countries needed to go further on financing their defence capabilities, arguing that spending 2% of GDP was be a minimum target and that during the Cold War countries were spending upwards of 5%.
The foreign secretary also used her speech to argue that the war in Ukraine is  a ""paradigm shift"" comparable with the 9/11 terror attacks on the United States.
She urged the West to ""rise to his moment"" by increasing pressure on the Russian president. 
""How we respond today will set the pattern for this new era. 
""We must start with the principle that the only thing aggressors understand is strength… and we must start by working together to stop Putin's offensive in Ukraine.""
""We want a situation where they can't access their funds, they can't clear their payments, their trade can't flow, their ships can't dock and their planes can't land,"" she added.
More than two million Ukrainians have fled their country since Russia invaded Ukraine
Speaking at a news conference on Wednesday with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Ms Truss warned there would be ""terrible implications for European and global security"" if Mr Putin were not stopped in Ukraine.
Responding to Ms Truss' comments, Labour's shadow foreign secretary David Lammy said the invasion of Ukraine ""marked the final end of the post-cold war era"".
He criticised the Conservatives for ""isolating Britain on the world stage"" and said it was time ""to bring Britain back to the table and deepen ties with our European partners"".

The calls for stronger action come as western officials say they are ""very concerned"" Russia could resort to using non-conventional weapons.
This could include chemical weapons, biological weapons and dirty bombs.

Anyone who travels unlawfully to Ukraine for combat will be investigated on their return to the UK, the Foreign office has said
Some military veterans have received cold call approaches about fighting in Ukraine, the BBC understands. 
Private militias have reportedly been scouring social media to recruit ex-soldiers.
Ukraine has previously asked for volunteers to join its International Legion.
But the Foreign Office has said anyone who travels unlawfully to Ukraine for combat will be investigated on their return to the UK.
Afghanistan veteran Steve, not his real name, told the BBC Wales Live programme he had received at least 10 approaches, including one which offered him money.

""Whenever there's conflict the chatter starts up, but there was a different tone to this, a more deliberate tone,"" he said. 
""There are private militias who've been scouring social media for veterans, so these private militias have been trying to recruit.""
Steve said he believed the offer of money wasn't genuine, but many of the other contacts he'd received were from other veterans looking to organise groups in the UK before travelling to Ukraine. 
One veteran said he had been offered money to fight in Ukraine
""I did very well on my second tour of Afghanistan and obviously when you're over there you make a lot of contacts,"" he said. 
""The more serious guys are trying to organise it here and go as a group of people that are people you've deployed with, served with, people who know each other's skill set."" 
'Some have no military experience'
However, Steve said he was increasingly concerned for the welfare of both veterans and civilian volunteers.
""A lot of guys want to go out and help, but some are jumping on the bandwagon and have no military experience. Some are veterans, but they've never deployed, so they've never been in combat,"" he said. 
""Veterans with mental health issues, physical issues, and people that go over there that can't fight, that's not actually a help that's more of a hindrance.  
""Who are you meeting at the border? Will you get good weapons systems? Will you get medical care? There are too many moving parts.""  
A Scottish grandfather, Rab Grady (centre), announced he was fighting alongside the Ukrainians on a video he posted online
Despite doing his best to warn others of the dangers, Steve said many veterans would be vulnerable to offers, and the constant talk about going to fight had left his own mind racing.
""I did take myself off down to the beach early hours one morning,"" he said.
""I needed to get some de-sensitisation away from radio, away from social media, and to just think it through.
""If I think with my brain and not emotion then that tells me I've fought - I've been somewhere and done something - and my priority now is my family.""

BBC Wales Live has heard from veteran support staff concerned that more vulnerable members of the community could be tempted by approaches.
Mark, not his real name, is an agricultural worker with no military experience. But he feels he can contribute to Ukraine's war effort. 
""I've spoken to a few people, but not many,"" the 26-year-old said.
""They've all been telling me not to go, that I'm a bit crazy for wanting to go and there are different ways to help, but it feels like the best way to help is by being on the ground. 
""I'm ready to book a flight, I've just got bits and bobs to get now and then I'll be over there."" 
'We've had people ringing up with lists'
An Army surplus store said it had sold stock that would normally take ""years"" to sell
Kirsty, who works in an Army surplus store, said it had almost sold out of its entire stock of combat helmets and vests. 
""We've had people ringing up with lists, asking can we donate items. Things like helmets, plate carriers, any proper military protective gear,"" she said.  
""We're a very small business, the things people want, we can't just give them away."" 
Robert McCartney, from charity Beyond the Battlefield, said he'd heard of veterans approaching each other about going out to Ukraine.
""Social media is full of it,"" he said. ""A lot of these guys are saying 'right, I'm on my way - does anybody want to be there?'
""They see themselves as being able to go out there and recreate themselves as soldiers. 
""They are approaching the guys who are in responsible positions, who are in relationships.""
Mr McCartney raised concerns for some vulnerable veterans.
""One of them came in here last week telling me that he was going on Sunday,"" he said. 
""I was able to talk him out of it. He's got an eight-week-old baby and that was his biggest worry, so I was able to play on those worries.""
A spokesperson for the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office said: ""We advise against travel to Ukraine and anyone who travels to conflict zones to engage in unlawful activity, should expect to be investigated upon their return to the UK.""

Refugees arrive in Poland after fleeing the war in Ukraine
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has approved $1.4bn (£1.1bn) of emergency funding for Ukraine, as it fights against a Russian invasion.
It comes as the IMF predicts Ukraine will see a deep recession this year.
More than 2m people are estimated to have left the country since the war started two weeks ago. 
Earlier this week, the World Bank approved a $732m financial package for Ukraine and is planning more economic assistance for the coming months. 
""The Russian military invasion of Ukraine has been responsible for a massive humanitarian and economic crisis,"" IMF managing director Kristalina Georgieva said in a statement., external
Ms Georgieva said the money was aimed to meet the country's urgent spending needs and help ease the huge economic impact of the war.
""The tragic loss of life, huge refugee flows, and immense destruction of infrastructure and productive capacity is causing severe human suffering and will lead to a deep recession this year. Financing needs are large, urgent, and could rise significantly as the war continues,"" she added.
The funds will be disbursed under IMF's Rapid Financing Instrument. This means it will largely come without conditions that are usually placed on borrower countries.
Ukraine bank: Use frozen Russian money to rebuild
World Bank approves $723m funding for Ukraine
The IMF financing comes on top of a $723m World Bank economic package, which was announced earlier this week.
That package was made up of grants and loans, including a $100m pledge from the UK.
The World Bank said it was continuing to work on a $3bn package of support for the coming months.
It also promised extra help for neighbouring countries that are taking in the estimated 2m refugees - who are mostly women, children and the elderly - fleeing Ukraine.
In recent days Ukraine's government has taken other steps to support its war-torn economy.
Last week, the country raised $270m through the sale of war bonds and said it planned to issue non-fungible tokens to help fund its armed forces.

Kyrylo Shevchenko, Governor of National Bank of Ukraine, in September 2021
Frozen Russian assets should be used to rebuild Ukraine after the war, the governor of Ukraine’s Central Bank has told the BBC.
Kyrylo Shevchenko called for an extensive list of extra sanctions, from cutting card payments to suspending Russian access to the IMF.
Every day that sanctions are delayed ""is costing the lives of civilians and children"", he said in an interview.
For security reasons, he answered questions sent by email.
Mr Shevchenko, governor of the National Bank of Ukraine, said that Russia should eventually be made to pay to repair the damage caused during the invasion.
“The need for money will be huge,” he told the BBC. “It could be fulfilled through loans and grants from multinational organisations and direct help from other countries. However a large share of financing is needed to be obtained as a reparation from the aggressor, including funds that are currently frozen in our allied countries.”
The government building in Kharkiv, destroyed by Russian missiles. Rebuilding Ukraine will cost billions
Much of Russia’s $630bn of foreign exchange reserves are thought to be held outside the country, and effectively frozen by sanctions in the US, the EU and other places.
That would make billions available for reconstruction – if Ukraine is able to access it once the war is over.
Extra sanctions
Mr Shevchenko welcomed the financial sanctions already imposed by the international community, but said the world should go much further. He called on governments, institutions and companies to impose an extensive list of further financial sanctions, targeting every corner of Russia's economy.
He called on:
Trading and financial data platforms Refinitiv and Bloomberg to terminate access for Russian and Belarusian clients.
US and EU to instruct their banks to sever correspondent relationships with Russian banks.
The central banks’ organisation, the Bank for International Settlements, to expel Russia's central bank.
The International Monetary Fund to suspend Russia and Belarus from its meetings, block their access to assets issued by the IMF called Special Drawing Rights, “as these funds may be used to finance military action against our country.” 
China’s UnionPay card payment system (similar to Mastercard and Visa) to stop servicing payment cards issued by Russian banks.  
Armenia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkey and Vietnam to block the Russian payment system, Mir.
International money transfer operator Western Union to cease deliveries of cash to Russian and Belarusian banks. 
“We already see the effect [of sanctions] on the aggressor’s financial system, but we are still waiting for more to be done. I would like to underline that every day that sanctions are delayed is costing the lives of civilians and children,” Mr Shevchenko said.
“These are the lives of Ukrainians who have chosen the European way and are now defending not only their own country, but also the entire system of values that lies at the core of the Western civilization.”
Central bankers normally target inflation.
What is clear from the testimony of the Ukraine's version of Andrew Bailey is that in this war they are leaving no stone uncovered in their targeting of the Russian financial system.
Every pipeline of cash into the ""aggressor"" has been identified, even as Mr Shevchenko's team tries to keep the cash flowing in the Ukrainian financial system and to its millions of refugees, and even set his country's monetary policy from a bunker.
The IMF, the Bank for International Settlements, Western Union, Chinese credit card payment systems, former Soviet nations' use of Russia's payments system, all are the subject of Kyiv's lobbying to subject the Russian financial system to an unprecedented squeeze.
Above all, that targeting of Russia's Central Bank, agreed by G7 nations, has disarmed its warchest of foreign exchange reserves and halved the value of the rouble.
I asked him if he was worried about the precedent being set here for institutions normally given sovereign immunity. He pauses. ""I can answer from the bottom of my heart. We see that the Central Bank of Russia supports military invasion and thus is also guilty, responsible in deaths of civilians in Ukraine"". 
Donations 
Around 11bn hryvnia ($350m, £280m) has been paid in to the two special accounts set up by the National Bank of Ukraine to receive donations for the military and for humanitarian causes, Mr Shevchenko told the BBC.
The account for the military was set up on 24 February to accept international and local donations in multiple currencies.
A similar account for humanitarian purposes was set up on 1 March.
Oil embargo
Western countries have wrestled with the difficulties of suspending purchases of Russian energy. While the cash Moscow receives for oil and gas exports is a vital lifeline, European governments have decided that they can’t live without vital Russian supplies, at least for now. 
Mr Shevchenko said: “Today we can see that Russia is using its energy resources capacities to put economic pressure on Europe. Energy is also one of the leading narratives in the Russian media. They are using it to misinform the Russian public about the West’s unwillingness to take tougher measures, out of fear of losing access to Russian oil and gas. 
Kyrylo Shevchenko, filmed yesterday by NBU staff
“We realise how difficult this decision is for our Western partners. We understand the cost of such a step. But we must work together to find and use all possible tools to stop the killing and the suffering that Russia is increasingly causing in Ukraine.”
Keeping going
Mr Shevchenko also described some of the challenges of keeping the country’s financial system running during a war.
His staff are working round the clock, he said, many sheltering from bombardment in underground bunkers. 
But he said electronic payments and ATMs were still working, and cash was being delivered to everywhere but active combat zones. 
“I can proudly say that Ukrainian banking system remains stable and liquid even under martial law.”
“This is extremely difficult time for every Ukrainian - for the people and the country,” he said. “The National Bank of Ukraine is doing everything in its power to support Ukraine, its defenders, and the population affected by Russian aggression.”

Chancellor Rishi Sunak faces a ""huge judgment call"" over whether to borrow more or allow household budgets to be squeezed, new research suggests.
The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) says the soaring cost of living and war in Ukraine present fresh challenges ahead of the Spring Statement.
Without extra protection, many households will struggle to keep up with bills, it suggests.
Inflation rose to its highest level for 30 years last month.
Prices surged by 5.5% in the 12 months to January, up from 5.4% in December, due to rising energy, fuel and food prices.
Inflation, which measures how quickly the cost of living increases over time, is now rising faster than wages and is expected to climb above 7% this year. 
As Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine pushes energy costs, fuel and other commodities even higher, the IFS says Chancellor Rishi Sunak faces three big decisions.
The first is whether to borrow billions more or allow household incomes to take a bigger hit than at any time since at least the financial crisis. The government has already increased borrowing in recent years to pay for Covid-related measures such as the furlough scheme.
Mr Sunak must also weigh whether to allow inflation to impose effective pay cuts on teachers, nurses and other public sector workers - or to spend less than anticipated on other parts of public services, if borrowing is not an option.
Public sector workers face an average pay cut of about £1,750 once inflation is taken into account, the IFS research says.
And as war in Ukraine continues, the chancellor will have to decide whether to allow defence spending to fall over the next three years, or to borrow to boost it.
""At the Spring Statement, Rishi Sunak has to make a huge judgment call,"" IFS director Paul Johnson said.
""Will he do more to protect households from the effects of energy prices, which have risen even further in the last two weeks?
""If he doesn't, then many on moderate incomes will face the biggest hit to their living standards since at least the financial crisis. If he does, then there will be another big hit to the public finances.""
He told the BBC's Today programme that the chancellor will have to borrow ""at least another £10bn just to cover half the blow from energy prices"".
Mr Johnson warned that rising energy costs look set to continue rather than be a short peak. ""If energy prices are high for three-to-four years, it makes it much harder for the government to support people,"" he said.
Rising inflation - which he warned could reach 8% or more this year - is hurting public sector workers.
Mr Johnson estimated the Treasury would have to find between £1,500-£2,000 per worker to make up the impact of inflation on pay. ""They've already suffered big cuts,"" he said. 
Calls for urgent help over rising household bills
Cost of filling diesel family car hits record £90 
The IFS suggests that if Mr Sunak wants to achieve the same level of protection for households' budgets as he announced earlier this year, he will need to find an extra £12bn.
While the chancellor might have had little choice in spending billions to protect the economy during the extraordinary circumstances of the pandemic, Mr Johnson says the chancellor's response to the cost of living crisis will reveal more about how he sees the government's role in protecting consumers from external events.
The boss of energy regulator Ofgem, Jonathan Brearley, for example, has said that households are heading for an ""almost inevitable"" rise in energy bills in the autumn.
Spikes in wholesale gas prices, which were rising even before Russia's invasion of Ukraine, will be passed on to consumers, he warned on Tuesday.
A Treasury spokesperson said the government was already providing more than £20bn to help people with the cost of living and would continue to monitor the economic impact of the conflict.
""Russia's devastating invasion of Ukraine will have a huge impact on lives and livelihoods around the world and the effects will be felt across this country,"" the spokesperson said.
""It is right that we do all we can to show solidarity with the people of Ukraine and work with our allies and partners to impose the most punishing sanctions to inflict maximum and lasting pain on Russia."" 
The shadow chancellor, Labour MP Rachel Reeves, accused the government of allowing ""the cost of living crisis to spiral out of control since September"".
She called on the chancellor to reconsider ""unfair"" National Insurance contributions, which are due to go up in April to fund social care in England and help the NHS recover after the pandemic.
The Labour party has proposed the introduction of a one-off ""windfall"" tax on oil and gas producers, which would then be used to cut energy costs for consumers.

213,213,Faulty drainage work blamed for fatal Stonehaven derailment,"Thu, 10 Mar 2022 06:18:28 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-north-east-orkney-shetland-60654251,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-north-east-orkney-shetland-60654251?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,Three people died when the train hit a landslide in heavy rain in Aberdeenshire in 2020.,"Faulty drainage work blamed for fatal Stonehaven derailment
A series of failures contributed to a rail crash in Aberdeenshire which claimed three lives, an investigation has found.
A report said the train hit a landslide near Stonehaven in August 2020 after heavy rain in an area where a drainage system had been incorrectly installed.
Investigators also highlighted problems with operational procedures in dealing with the effects of severe weather. 
Train drivers' union Aslef said it was a ""damning"" report. 
""The failures identified are so bad that we believe this must be a watershed moment in the way we ensure the safety of passengers and staff,"" general secretary Mick Whelan added. 
Driver Brett McCullough, 45, conductor Donald Dinnie, 58, and passenger Christopher Stuchbury, 62, died when the train derailed on 12 August 2020.
Six other people were injured when the 06:38 Aberdeen to Glasgow service hit washed-out debris at Carmont, south of Stonehaven.
The train was returning towards Aberdeen due to the railway being blocked further down the line.

Animation reconstructs moment of Stonehaven train derailment
The Rail Accident Investigation Branch (RAIB) made 20 safety recommendations in its report, external on the crash. 
They include better management of civil engineering projects, improved response to extreme rainfall, and better understanding of the additional risk associated with older trains.
And they noted that there were only nine people on the train due to pandemic restrictions.
""With normal passenger numbers, the casualty toll would almost certainly have been significantly higher,"" the report said.
The drainage problem
The train hit debris in heavy rain
A drainage system was installed in 2011 and 2012 by now-collapsed contractor Carillion - but it was not in accordance with the design. 
Had it been constructed correctly, it was ""highly likely to have safely accommodated the flow of surface water"" on the day of the crash, the report concluded. 
More than 5cm (2in) of rain fell on the site of the crash between 06:00 and 09:00 - close to the average for the whole of August in this part of Scotland. 
The train derailed because it struck debris that had washed out of a drainage trench, the report said. 
It was travelling at about 73mph - below the limit of 75mph. Mr McCullough, the driver, had been told to proceed at normal speed.
Derailment driver was told 'normal speed fine'
Climate change impact on railways 'accelerating'
Three dead after passenger train derails
Investigators found no evidence Network Rail carried out any inspection of the upper parts of the drainage system between when it viewed the completed work in 2013 and the accident.
They said that, had Network Rail been aware of the differences between the design and the installation, the risk could have been recognised and action taken. 
Coping with severe weather
The RAIB said it found evidence that the Scotland route control team was under ""severe workload pressure"" on the morning of the crash, due to the volume of weather-related events.
The investigation also found that controllers had not been given sufficient guidance or training to enable them to effectively manage complex situations of the type encountered.
Although Network Rail had taken some steps towards implementing modern technology to help monitor weather conditions and better inform operational decision makers, its capability had not been ""fully exploited"" before the accident at Carmont. 
The RAIB concluded that, despite an awareness of the threat, Network Rail had not sufficiently recognised that its existing measures did not fully address the risk from extreme rainfall events.
The age of the train
A train built to modern standards would have had design features intended to minimise damage in a collision or derailment. 
The train involved in the Carmont derailment had been recently refurbished but it was designed and constructed before these standards came into force. 
It is ""more likely than not"" that there would have been a better outcome to the crash if the train had complied with modern standards, the RAIB concluded. 
Transport Secretary Jenny Gilruth later told MSPs a steering group had been set up to examine the safety of older trains.
Scottish Labour MSP, Neil Bibby, said the Aslef union was calling for high speed train (HST) rolling stock to be phased out by August next year and asked the minister when they would be withdrawn from service.
Ms Gilruth said the rail network was currently quite reliant on HSTs, but added: ""We will come to looking at a date in the future which we may be able to remove some of these trains from service.""
What has the reaction been?
Donald Dinnie, Christopher Stuchbury and Brett McCullough died
Simon French, the chief inspector of rail accidents, said the industry owed it to everyone affected by the tragedy to learn safety lessons for the future. 
""It's important for all of us in the rail industry not to dismiss this truly harrowing accident as a one-off event,"" he added. 
""The railway industry needs to think through the implications of severe weather on its infrastructure, whilst also looking to the behaviour of trains should they derail after striking obstructions such as washouts and landslips.""
Neil Stuchbury, whose father Christopher Stuchbury died in the crash, said the conditions on the day had been ""unusual"" but ""were not at all unforeseen"".
""The tools, know-how, and processes were available to prevent this but were not properly implemented,"" he said.
Mr Stuchbury said the report showed that ""a catalogue of errors and oversights"" were responsible for the crash. 
Relatives of conductor Donald Dinnie added: ""Whilst losing a loved one in these dreadful circumstances has been totally devastating, we also reflect that this accident happened at a time when the early stages of the pandemic saw fewer people travelling.""
The derailment happened near Stonehaven in August 2020
ScotRail chief operating officer Ian McConnell said the report was ""very sober reading"".
Network Rail chief executive Andrew Haines said: ""This report makes clear that there are fundamental lessons to be learnt by Network Rail and the wider industry.
""As well as expressing our deep sorrow and regret at the loss of the lives of Christopher Stuchbury, Donald Dinnie and Brett McCullough, it's important that we acknowledge it should not have taken this tragic accident to highlight those lessons.
""We must do better and we are utterly committed to that.""
The RMT union called for a safety summit involving governments, Network Rail and operators to ""ensure this type of tragedy can never happen again"". 
The Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service said: ""A joint investigation into the deaths by Police Scotland, British Transport Police and the Office of Rail and Road is ongoing and once complete will be fully considered.
""The families will continue to be kept updated in relation to any significant developments.
""Our thoughts are with the families of Donald Dinnie, Brett McCullough and Christopher Stuchbury at this time.""

US Border Patrol agents found dozens of horned lizards and snakes hidden in a man's clothing as he crossed into the US from Mexico last month. 
The scaly discovery occurred at the San Ysidro border crossing near San Diego around 03:00 local time on 25 February. 
The man was driving a pickup truck when he was pulled over for inspection.
Officers discovered 43 horned lizards and nine snakes in plastic bags ""concealed in the man's jacket, pants pockets and groin area,"" agents said.
The suspect, identified as a 30-year old American citizen, was arrested on the suspicion of illegal wildlife smuggling. 
Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) officials say some of the animals are endangered and have now been placed in ""a secure and safe area"" quarantined from other animals.
""Smugglers will try every possible way to try and get their product, or in this case live reptiles, across the border,"" said Sidney Aki, CBP director of field operations in San Diego, California.
""In this occasion, the smuggler attempted to deceive CBP officers in order to bring these animals into the US, without taking care for the health and safety of the animals.""

Former world number one Novak Djokovic played in his first tournament of 2022 in Dubai in February
Novak Djokovic has withdrawn from Indian Wells and the Miami Open - the first two Masters Series events of the year - because of US coronavirus rules.
Regulations require any non-US citizen to have a Covid vaccination before entering the country.
Serb Djokovic, 34, told the BBC last month that he had not been vaccinated.
The 20-time Grand Slam winner was included in the draw for both events, but has since posted on Twitter that he knew it was ""unlikely"" he could travel.

He is likely to make his return to the tour at the Monte Carlo Masters in April.
The Indian Wells draw will be less balanced following the late withdrawal of Djokovic, who was seeded second.
As the next player in line to be seeded outside the tournament's top 32, last year's semi-finalist Grigor Dimitrov will move into Djokovic's space in the draw. A lucky loser from qualifying will fill the Bulgarian's spot in due course.
Djokovic missed the Australian Open in January, being deported from the country after its government cancelled his visa in a row over his vaccine status.
In an interview with the BBC last month, he said that he is prepared to miss other big events in future.
""The principles of decision making on my body are more important than any title or anything else,"" he said.
""I'm trying to be in tune with my body as much as I possibly can.""
By missing the Australian Open, Djokovic was overtaken in the list of overall major titles by eventual winner Rafael Nadal, who secured a record 21st Grand Slam.
Djokovic's first tournament in 2022 came in Dubai in February, where he was beaten by Czech Jiri Vesely in the quarter-finals.
The defeat meant he conceded his world number one ranking to Russian Daniil Medvedev, who claimed his first major title at the US Open in September and is the top seed at Indian Wells.
Analysis
Russell Fuller, tennis correspondent
Djokovic has very few ranking points to defend before his likely next appearance in Monte Carlo. 
In fact, he will be world number one again in a fortnight if Daniil Medvedev fails to reach the quarter-finals here in Indian Wells.
But even though his ranking will not be adversely affected, Djokovic is passing up the opportunity to win two of the biggest titles outside of the Grand Slams.
From a public relations perspective, it would have been so much better to have withdrawn 24 hours earlier.
There are clearly far more important things going on in the world right now, but pulling out after the draw has repercussions for other players as well as the tournament itself.

Karim Benzema is the first player from France to score three Champions League/European Cup hat-tricks
Karim Benzema scored a superb second-half hat-trick as Real Madrid produced a stirring fightback at a raucous Bernabeu to reach the Champions League quarter-finals at the expense of Paris St-Germain. 
Kylian Mbappe's first-half goal had given PSG a deserved two-goal aggregate lead and looked to have put Mauricio Pochettino's side well on course for the last eight. 
However, a mistake by PSG goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma proved the catalyst for a dramatic recovery with Benzema turning home after the Italian dawdled in possession. 
Luka Modric's driving run and intricate pass made Benzema's second as he levelled the tie against a clearly panicked PSG, and as the visitors attempted to regroup the 34-year-old drove a low effort into the bottom right corner seconds after the restart to settle the tie.
Is Benzema the best number nine in the world?
Until Donnarumma's error PSG had been in complete control. 
Marco Verratti was slick and dominant in midfield, while Neymar and Lionel Messi worked themselves into some dangerous positions as the hosts struggled to contain their more fluent opponents.
Mbappe in particular was electric, racing on to a pass from Neymar to open the scoring against the side he has been heavily tipped to join in the summer when his contract at PSG expires.
Either side of that the 23-year-old tormented the Real defence, twice having goals correctly disallowed for offside but showing his predatory instincts nonetheless.
A surge of acceleration also saw him burst past Real's Eder Militao and only a brilliant covering challenge from David Alaba prevented him from adding to his tally. 
Mbappe's influence was such that he received warm applause from the home support as he got up after appearing to be hurt in a tackle, but the real damage to his and PSG's long-standing aspirations in the competition were still to come.

Listen: Football Daily podcast reacts to Real's victory
PSG suffer another painful exit
Benzema's 17-minute treble ensured PSG suffered another painful elimination from a competition that has become an obsession since they moved into Qatari ownership in 2011.
And after reaching the final and semi-finals in consecutive seasons this feels like a considerable backwards step for a squad that has been expensively assembled but remains prone to monumental collapses in this competition.
This felt every bit as shattering as their 6-1 thrashing by Barcelona in 2017, their last-16 defeat by Manchester United in 2019, and was even more remarkable given they had not lost a Champions League away game after leading at half-time since 2001.
While PSG are runaway leaders in Ligue 1 and have been crowned French champions in seven of the past nine seasons, domestic success is not the barometer Pochettino will be judged by come the end of the season. 
And alarmingly the Argentine and his stunned players were unable to provide any adequate response once the tide had turned in this contest. 
Julian Draxler and Angel di Maria were only introduced once the Parisiens were chasing the game, and aside from a late Messi free-kick which dipped just over, they were unable to conjure a single clear-cut goalscoring opportunity as they meekly exited the tournament.

218,218,The Russians using emojis to evade censors,"Thu, 10 Mar 2022 01:29:13 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/60649725,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/60649725?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,"Amid a protest crackdown, young people are still risking freedom to oppose the conflict in Ukraine.","The Russians using emojis to evade censors
On 24 February, as Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine, an image started to spread on social media - a picture of the Russian poet Pushkin, the number seven and rows of the ""person walking"" emoji. 
To those in the know, the meaning was clear - a location (Pushkin Square, in Moscow), a time and a call to protest against the government's actions. 
The emojis made reference to a code used for years in Russia to refer to protests -  one so well known to the authorities, it is barely a code at all, according to human rights group OVD-Info. 
Why use code?
Unauthorised protests have been banned in the country since 2014 and breaches of the rules can lead to up to 15 days detention for a first offence. Repeat offenders can receive prison sentences of up to five years. 
Since then, it has been common for activists to use various coded phrases to organise online. 
""It's like, 'Let's go for a walk to the centre,' or, 'The weather is great for a walk,'"" Maria says. This is what she will text her friends to let them know she plans to attend a protest.
False claims that Ukraine war is a hoax go viral
The young Ukrainians battling pro-Russian trolls 
Misleading Ukraine war claims continue to go viral
What started as a way to evade government censors has almost become an inside joke or a meme, Maria tells BBC News. 
Nevertheless, the consequences of not using this language can be serious. 
What are the potential consequences?
Alexander attended a protest in Moscow, having posted about it on social media.
The following morning, plain-clothes officers picked him up outside his girlfriend's building and took him to the local police department. He was detained for several days and compelled to sign a document listing what the authorities said he had done.  
We cannot be certain his attendance at the protest or his social media activity led to Alexander's detention. He was later arrested for a second time, while using the Moscow Metro, on a day he had not been attending a protest.
BBC News has learned of other detentions based solely on social media activity, including one woman arrested for a tweet.  
On 24 February, she posted: ""I haven't walked in the centre for a long time,"" and quoted another account's tweet containing a more explicit call to rally.
Five days later, she was arrested while taking a train. 
She believes she was detected by facial-recognition software active on the Moscow Metro system - and in her court hearing, a document containing her tweet was presented, showing the authorities had taken a screenshot of it almost immediately after she had posted it. 
In another case, Niki, a blogger, described how a close friend's brother had been detained twice - once for a few hours after attending a protest and a second time, for a whole week, for sharing the details with his friends on VK, Russia's equivalent of Facebook. 
Almost 14,000 people have been detained across Russia since the conflict began a fortnight ago, mainly for attending protests according to OVD-Info - which provides legal advice.
So far, most have been held for a matter of hours or days. 
Is the situation changing?
A law was introduced in Russia on Friday 4 March, with the stated aim of tackling ""fake news"" about the military but it is expected to be used to crack down even further on anti-war protests - including prison sentences of up to 15 years, significantly longer than previous sanctions.
For young people such as Maria, this has ""already changed things, because now I'm afraid to go to protest and also I'm afraid to post about this 'special operation' [Russia's invasion of Ukraine]"".
And there are clear indications arrests have increased since the new law was introduced, OVD-Info says.
Where are Russians now posting?
The shuttering of independent media outlets, blocking of Facebook and restrictions on Russians posting on TikTok have taken away key routes to access information, OVD-Info co-ordinator Leonid Drabkin says, and people will self-censor out of fear.
""Now if you go to your Instagram, there are like 10 times fewer posts,"" he says.
Many of his contacts have deleted their social-media profiles altogether. 
And coupled with the stringent penalties, this has already affected the number of people ""brave enough to protest"". 
Some contributors' names have been changed to protect their identities.

Like many other Ukrainians, Volodymyr Dehtyarov has no idea how long the exile will last
The Russian invasion of Ukraine has torn apart the lives of millions. Many of those who were fleeing the country grew up under communism when Ukraine was part of the USSR - the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. The BBC's Fergal Keane met two members of that older generation at a railway station in Lviv, western Ukraine, where they were trying to escape from Ukraine. 
When he was a soldier in Afghanistan there was only him and the men he fought alongside. To fight the mujahideen in Kandahar meant looking out for each other. Nobody else mattered. The men were given their orders and they fought.
In those days Volodymyr Dehtyarov was a soldier of the USSR, not knowing then that the mission to save the pro-Moscow regime in Kabul was doomed. 
""We were given our orders and we did our duty,"" he tells me. The old soldier is standing in a long line at Lviv railway station waiting to be evacuated to Poland along with his daughter, daughter-in-law and four of his grandchildren. His son and an autistic grandson have had to stay behind in Mykolaiv, southern Ukraine. 
Volodymyr Dehtyarov - seen in this picture during his military service in Afghanistan - does not speak to the Russian veterans he once fought alongside any more
In his black-and-white photographs from that other war the background is bleached of detail by the harsh sunlight. He stands confidently, weapon cradled in his arms. 
The photos, like his Afghan service medal, are mementos of a once mighty power and a time of comradeship forged in battle.
But the Red Army is long gone. And this new war has cleaved apart his friendships with the Russian veterans he once fought alongside. 
""We no longer speak with each other,"" he says. 
Volodymyr retired from the military with the rank of lieutenant colonel. He is aware of the propaganda being fed to Russians by their government, the characterising of Ukraine as a state run by Nazis and fascists. 
When I ask what he thinks of such labels he laughs. It is a long, bitter laugh and he waves his arm towards the press of women and children and old people in the line around him.
""That's some question. Here? Nazis? Fascists? These people? Guys what are you talking about? These are not fascists or Nazis? Look at them. These are Ukrainians. It's simple.""
The veteran boarded a train for Poland with his family group and was hoping to go further west, further into the European Union. Like everybody else here he has no idea how long the exile will last.
Valentyna Malyshkina doesn't even have a mobile phone - but hopes to get one from volunteers in Poland
Heading in the same direction - but alone - is 82-year-old Valentyna Malyshkina, from Kryvyi Rih in central Ukraine. She has a piece of paper in her hand upon which her daughter's phone number is written. 
She explains that she does not have a mobile phone - but hopes to borrow one from a volunteer when she gets to Poland. 
Where exactly was she going? She didn't know. Would anybody meet her? Again, she was not aware of anybody waiting in Poland. But so far the volunteers had been kind. They had given her food. 
When her blood pressure went up and she felt faint they gave her a tablet to place under her tongue to relieve the symptoms of dizziness. Someone had found her a chair. 
Every time the queue moves along somebody helps her to stand and go forward.
""I don't know anything. I am going. And that's it,"" she says. ""I hope there are good people. That's all. I believe I won't be left behind."" 
I thought for a moment that it was brave to be so confident in the kindness of strangers.
Yet everything I have seen at Lviv station, and all I have heard about the reception for the elderly in Poland, suggests Valentyna is right. There will be welcome and comfort for the old woman as she moves into that unknown landscape in the ninth decade of her life.

The war in Ukraine has already caused a surge in some food prices globally, with wheat prices up 40% this month.
Both Russia and Ukraine are among the world's largest agricultural producers and Ukraine is often called ""the breadbasket of Europe"".
With Ukraine's southern ports closed by fighting and Russia's exports affected by sanctions, there are concerns that poorer countries will be hit hard by further pressure on food prices - which the UN says were already at a 10 year high in 2021. 
The BBC's Ros Atkins explains why global food price rises appear inevitable as a consequence of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

More than two million people have now fled Ukraine because of the Russian invasion
Home secretaries must know how to deal with flak. It goes with the job. 
But when accusations of foot-dragging, complacency, heartlessness and lies come from your own backbenches, you know you have got a serious problem.
One Tory MP has called for Priti Patel to resign over her handling of the Ukrainian refugee emergency.
The Home Office is in crisis mode, trying to convince an increasingly sceptical nation that the department has got a grip of the situation.  
""We are doing our best,"" one insider tells me, before adding: ""But we haven't got everything right.""
The nightly images of desperate families fleeing a war but turned away by UK government officials confirm the latter point. 
This is becoming deeply damaging for the Home Office and the prime minister. Priti Patel is under intense pressure, with suggestions that Downing Street is losing confidence.
The surprise appointment of a minister for refugees operating across two government departments suggests the Home Office is not trusted to sort matters out alone.
'Soul-destroying' criticism
Tellingly, the sponsorship scheme launched to bring some Ukrainians to Britain is being run by Michael Gove's communities department.
Home Office staff were overstretched before the latest humanitarian disaster started to unfold - trying to deal with thousands of Afghans coming to Britain to escape the Taliban, migrants arriving by the boatload having crossed the channel, tens of thousands of Hongkongers fleeing the Chinese clampdown, and increasing numbers of unaccompanied asylum-seeking children with nowhere to stay.
For a department trying to convince sceptical voters its attitude to immigration has changed from the days of the ""hostile environment"" and the Windrush scandal, accusations of inhumanity over the plight of Ukrainian refugees are damaging.  
""We are working 24/7 to try to respond in really, really challenging circumstances,"" an official tells me. 
""Some of the criticism has been soul-destroying, but we are not going to give up.""
She shows me a box of Pringles. ""This is my breakfast,"" she says, as evidence of how hard everyone is working.
Visas a shambles, Brits with Ukrainian family say
Ukraine ambassador's wife faced delay to get visa
How does the UK's visa scheme for Ukrainians work?
But it was the sight of hapless officials handing out crisps and Kit Kats to desperate refugees in Calais that will stick in the public's mind, a sense that the home secretary was not taking the plight of those fleeing the conflict in Ukraine seriously. 
The Home Office says it has been preparing for a possible humanitarian crisis in Ukraine since January, designing detailed policies for how to respond. But officials accept that their plans had to be adapted almost as soon as the first refugees asked for sanctuary in Britain.
""You can create a scheme on paper, and the first family group that applies does not meet the criteria,"" an insider tells me. ""We set up a scheme that we thought was very generous and then a case came onto the helpline and it wasn't suitable.""   
Critics see a department that is on the back foot, constantly forced into embarrassing U-turns, accused of both inhumanity and incompetence. But inside the department's headquarters in Westminster, they insist they are listening to the feedback and adjusting their policies in response.
Home Secretary Priti Patel visited the Ukrainian embassy in London at the weekend
One senior official gives me an example: ""In issuing a visa to a child, the original process required both parents to consent. But we realised that conscription in Ukraine meant fathers were away fighting and could not give consent. So we went to the home secretary and she agreed to change the rules.""
The question, though, is why did they not realise the problems earlier? Why was eligibility under the Ukrainian Family Scheme not initially applied to aunts and uncles, cousins and step-children? Why did the rule changes have to be forced out of the Home Office when the emergency reached the UK border?
The answer is that the Home Office's response to desperate people fleeing a war is shaped by a determination to maintain the integrity of the UK border. This is a government and a home secretary elected to get Brexit done, and for many of those who campaigned to leave the EU, taking back control of our borders was the central goal.
That is why Priti Patel's initial response was to say that people escaping the conflict should claim asylum in the first safe country they reached. ""It's important to note that the situation in Ukraine is very different from Afghanistan,"" I was advised by the Home Office, as the Russian tanks rolled across the Ukrainian border.
Ukraine: Does the Home Office need to get a grip?
At UK visa centre in Poland: 'There could be riots'
In those first days of the war, anyone displaced who wished to come to the UK had to satisfy the rules of the government's post-Brexit immigration system. The points-based approach meant refugees would have to demonstrate they earned enough money or had skills that benefited the United Kingdom.
It was a serious miscalculation. As the scale of the humanitarian crisis became clear, the Home Office was forced to move away from its hard-line policy. Time and again the Home Office has found itself having to adjust its policies as the pressure for a more compassionate response has increased. 
The central challenge stems from the insistence that any refugee coming to the UK must apply for a visa, complete biometric tests and satisfy ever-changing rules on eligibility.
The prime minister has defended the checks. 
""Some sort of control is an important feature of the way we do things,"" Boris Johnson said. ""Uncontrolled immigration is not the way forward"".
Avoiding people-traffickers
The government is trying to respond to a humanitarian disaster while still following the Brexit playbook. There are understandable concerns about opening Britain's doors to large numbers of refugees, that undesirable individuals may use the crisis to sneak into the country, posing a threat to national security.  
Controlling our borders remains central to the approach, a challenge currently most acute in Calais, where hundreds of Ukrainians are pleading to be let into Britain.
There is no visa application centre in Calais, so refugees are advised to travel to Paris or Brussels to sort out their paperwork before boarding a ferry or driving through the tunnel. The department claims it wants to ensure there is not a ""choke point"" in the city which might lead to vulnerable refugees being preyed upon by people-trafficking gangs.
Migrants camped around Calais continue to cross the channel in small boats, 2,214 already this year, a phenomenon that infuriates Brexit-supporting MPs who demand the home secretary do more to police the UK's border. 
There have been calls from across the House of Commons for the government to waive the visa requirements as countries across the EU have done. Priti Patel, though, remains opposed to such a move, preferring to tweak the existing immigration rules rather than set up a new humanitarian pathway for those displaced by the war in Ukraine.  
""We need to be really careful managing this process, organising housing, education, access to public services, registering for benefits,"" an official explains. ""We don't want services or resources not to be available.""

IN DEPTH: Full coverage of the conflict
The experience of the Afghan Citizens Resettlement Scheme, welcoming people who had fled the Taliban after the British military withdrawal, may help explain the reluctance to open the UK borders this time.  
Finding housing for the thousands who have already arrived has proved hugely problematic, with the department currently paying more than £1m a day to keep Afghans in requisitioned hotels.
Chastened by that experience, perhaps, the home secretary supported the idea of a Ukrainian sponsorship scheme - in which private individuals or companies can apply to bring a refugee into the UK, with the sponsor rather than the state taking responsibility for accommodation and support.
Sponsorship has been used before, notably to help Syrian refugees. But it is not a quick or straightforward response to a humanitarian emergency. The details are still being worked out. It remains unclear who will be eligible. It will be some time before any Ukrainian will arrive by that route.
The 21st Century Home Office must look tough and compassionate in equal measure. It must navigate the complex politics of immigration and balance the demands for freedom and control.  
""We are genuinely less worried about the reputational side of this than getting the right messages across,"" an insider claims.  
But the concern is that the Home Office is destined always to be playing catch-up as the human tragedy of the Ukrainian refugee emergency unfolds.

WATCH: The aftermath of a Russia strike on a maternity and children's hospital in Mariupol.
On day 14 of the war in Ukraine, as civilians fled towns and cities around the country, an air strike hit a maternity hospital in Mariupol.
The attack - which Ukraine blames on Russia - has been condemned around the world.
Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky posted footage showing burnt out cars, blown out windows and a deep crater in the ground outside.
Officials say at least 17 people were injured - staff and patients.
""We don't understand how it is possible in modern life to bomb a children's hospital,"" the deputy mayor of Mariupol, Serhiy Orlov, told the BBC.
Elsewhere, convoys of civilians were waiting to leave several towns near the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv.
In eastern Ukraine, some people did manage to escape from the city of Sumy; others were blocked as negotiations and fighting continued.

Chernobyl loses electricity
Almost two weeks after Russian forces seized the former nuclear power plant Chernobyl, the power has gone out.
Ukrainian authorities - who blamed the Russian troops for the outage - have suggested the situation could become dangerous, as the plant still requires constant management, decades after it became the site of the world's worst nuclear accident.
The head of the UN nuclear watchdog has said the power cut has not affected safety as the spent nuclear fuel left on site could not heat up enough to cause an accident.
The BBC's science correspondent, Pallab Ghosh, has taken a closer look at why experts say there isn't much reason to panic.
West fears Russia could use non-conventional weapons
Western officials have said they are ""very concerned"" about the risk of escalation in the war between Russia and Ukraine - particularly when it comes to the possibility of Moscow using non-conventional weapons.
This most likely refers to chemical weapons although the term also covers tactical (small-scale) nuclear weapons, biological weapons and dirty bombs.
They said this was partly because of what had been seen in other places where Russia has been engaged in conflict, notably Syria where chemical weapons were used by its allies.
The BBC's security correspondent, Gordon Corera, takes a closer look. 
The Russians thinking of running
Thousands of Russians are leaving the country, including these arriving by train in Helsinki
More than two million Ukrainians have already fled the invasion which engulfed their country just two weeks ago.
But in Russia, tens of thousands are also fleeing - some scared for their futures in a country cut off from the wider world, others frightened by the prospect of life under a more repressive regime.
In Moscow, Lydia is considering becoming the third generation in her family to escape Russia, following in the steps of her grandfather - who ran from Stalin - and his father before him - who fled the anti-Jewish pogroms.
Money may be playing a huge part in her deliberations, but there is something else as well: shame.
""I think it's going to take me and most of my friends years, before I can say I'm Russian and not feel ashamed,"" she tells the BBC.
Read her full story here.
Ukraine's first lady speaks out
Olena Zelenska is a familiar figure on the world stage
Olena Zelenska - a screenwriter before she became Ukraine's first lady - has said the Russian invasion amounts to the same as the ""mass murder"" of her country's civilians.
In a letter, published on the president's website, she described the deaths of children as ""the most terrifying and devastating"" part of the invasion, mentioning the names of three who had been killed since Moscow launched its attack two weeks ago.
""When Russia says that it is 'not waging war against civilians', I call out the names of these murdered children first,"" she wrote.

Watch: Lowri was shocked to be invited to the Bafta film awards
The director of Disney hit Encanto has invited a schoolgirl who campaigned to see more glasses-wearing heroines to join him at the Bafta film awards.
Lowri, from Chilwell, Nottinghamshire, wrote to Disney in 2019 asking for more characters that looked like her.
She saw her dream realised with Encanto's main character Mirabel, which director Jared Bush said was already in production when he saw the letter.
The awards take place on Sunday at London's Royal Albert Hall.
Lowri, 12, said she never expected her letter to be seen by anyone but Mr Bush said he had heard about it three years ago and ""so desperately"" wanted to tell her that her wish was about to come true. 
""But I had to wait and it was difficult,"" he said. 
Appearing on BBC Breakfast on Wednesday, Mr Bush said: ""As it turns out I may be in the UK and I wondered if you might be interested in maybe joining me and the other filmmakers at the Bafta awards ceremony?
""It's going to be a really, really great time. 
""I'm so excited to meet you in person, I can tell you all the Disney secrets that I couldn't tell you, but now I can whisper them all to you and no-one can stop me.""
Jared Bush said Lowri was ""an inspiration"" to everyone on the film's team
Speaking from Los Angeles, Mr Bush said: ""She's my hero. I can't imagine being that age and being that brave. You're such an inspiration to all of us.
""This is a movie that's all about us seeing each other and putting people on the screen that deserve to be seen. 
""And audiences from all over the world have been able to find themselves, their family members in these stories and it's something that we'd always hoped for and it's so rewarding.""
A gobsmacked Lowri struggled to speak after receiving the invite and nodded vigorously before presenter Jon Kay stepped in and said: ""I think that is a yes.""
""Oh my goodness, that's crazy. Thank you so much,"" she said.
Mirabel Madrigal from Encanto is Disney's first glasses-wearing heroine
Thanking the film director, her mother Cyrilyn Moore held back tears as she said: ""That is like the stuff dreams are made of, isn't it? That's beautiful.""
Lowri first spoke to Mr Bush on BBC Radio Nottingham last month when he surprised her with a special drawing of Mirabel by one of the film's artists, Jin Kim, which featured the words ""heroes wear glasses"".
Encanto is nominated for Best Animated Film award alongside Luca, Flee and The Mitchells vs. the Machines.
The 75th Baftas will be hosted by actress Rebel Wilson and broadcast on the BBC.

The ship sank 107 years ago and has been missing ever since.
But even though it has been sitting in 3km (10,000ft) of water for over a century, many of its features look just like it did on the day it went down.

Goin' loco: A silent disco is among the regular events held down at the Acapulco
A nightclub renowned for its sticky carpet is selling off souvenir chunks of its storied adhesive floor covering.
Halifax's Acapulco has been a fixture in the Yorkshire town since 1961 and punters have walked its distinctive, swirly patterned tapestry for 20 years.
Owner Simon Jackson said the sale idea came from a man celebrating a birthday with his mum and grandmother who had been club regulars in their youth.
The proceeds will be donated to a local Street Angels group.
Mr Jackson said the Acca - as the club is affectionately known - was a source of memories for generations of people in Halifax.
""We got to thinking how many people have met here and had first kisses, birthdays whatever here, that's when we got the idea,"" he said.
""Just think how many people have walked on its famous, crazy pattern.""
Bobby dazzler: The club said it planned to replace the unique pattern with a similar design
Mr Jackson said the parents of the birthday boy who inspired the scheme had actually met on the Acca's dancefloor.
He said he had even received an email from someone who spread a little of their grandmother's ashes on its carpet a few years ago. 
The proposal to sell squares of the carpet - at £5 each or £50 for a more sanitary framed version - started as a joke, according to the owner, but had ""snowballed"" as people expressed genuine interest.
Top TV talent, such as Michaela Strachan, pictured filming for the Hitman and Her, has graced the Acca
Before social media, the club would advertise its events - including the now-defunct ""Miss Stockings and Suspenders Contest"" in the local paper
Mr Jackson, 55, first worked at the club in the 1980s, became its owner in 1995 and still works as a DJ there.
The original carpet was made in Halifax and was due to be replaced several years ago, but a fire at the club followed by Covid restrictions had pushed the work back.
""We are one of a few clubs that have survived lockdown and with being the oldest Acapulco in the country, and family-owned, we feel more responsible to keep it going"", Mr Jackson said.
Work to replace the carpet has already started, and is expected to take about two weeks.
""The building is not the prettiest of places but it holds so many memories, it's not a trendy place just somewhere to party and forget your worries,"" he said.

228,228,The Capitol riot trial that tore a family apart,"Wed, 09 Mar 2022 23:35:41 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-60671723,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-60671723?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,"Guy Reffitt was convicted of taking part in the 6 January riots, in part due to testimony from his own son.","The Capitol riot trial that tore a family apart
Guy Reffitt cried in the courtroom when his son Jackson took the stand against him
Guy Reffitt, the first person to stand trial for the US Capitol riot, faced not only a judge and jury, but his own son on the witness stand. On Monday, Reffitt was sentenced to more than seven years in prison.
Those who know Reffitt say he is a big talker. So much so that his defence lawyer used it as his main argument for trying to have the case dismissed against Reffitt, who stood trial for bringing a handgun to the US Capitol during the 6 January riot.
But it was the volume of evidence of this bragging - detailed in texts, videos and audio - that convinced jurors of his guilt in a unanimous verdict in March after less than four hours of deliberations.
Court documents say Guy Reffitt was seen on video on the west front of the US Capitol on 6 January
The guilty verdict, delivered quickly and on all counts, was a huge victory for the government and is expected to affect the trials and defence strategy of other defendants indicted by the justice department.
But Reffitt's trial also showed how fissures dividing Americans have cracked wide open. It revealed how the deep political divide in the US has affected ordinary Americans and their families, often in a way that is emotionally wrenching and deeply personal. The divide has reached beyond the dinner table to pit family members against one another - in this case father against son -  with far-reaching consequences.
For it was Reffitt's son's testimony against his father - whose political views he had long opposed - that formed a crucial part of the prosecution's case.
What happened to the Capitol rioters?
The people who still believe Trump won
Weeks before Guy Reffitt drove from his hometown of Wylie, Texas, to Washington DC to storm the US Capitol, his son Jackson, 18 at the time, had already tipped-off the FBI.
It was a string of messages from his father on Christmas Eve to the family text chain that alarmed Jackson. In them, the older Reffitt announced his intention to go to the nation's capital ""to rise up the way the Constitution was written"".
During his testimony, Jackson said that he reported his father to the FBI because he was worried about his plans.
Afterwards, said Jackson, he struggled with feelings of guilt for betraying his father: ""I just felt gross.""
At first, Jackson heard nothing from the FBI. Then, in early January 2021, Guy Reffitt got behind the wheel of his wife's Chevrolet, with AR-15 rifles stashed away, and drove to Washington DC.
""We took the United States Capitol,"" he texted his family after the siege. ""We are the Republic of the People.""
When he returned home to Texas, Guy Reffitt spoke with his son and other members of his family about his experiences. He bragged about his role in the Capitol assault, said Jackson in his testimony.
""I started the fire,"" Guy Reffitt told his family. He did not know that his son was secretly recording him on his mobile phone.
He threatened his son, warning him not to tell the authorities.
""If you turn me in, you're a traitor,"" his father told Jackson. ""And traitors get shot.""
Soon after, Jackson spoke with an FBI agent. Within days, his father was arrested.
On the day that his son testified against him, Reffitt walked into the courtroom with a swagger. But when Jackson took the stand, Guy's demeanour changed. The big, burly man covered his face with his hands and doubled over in his chair, turning away from his son to hide his tears.
The two men looked strikingly similar that day. They both had the same lush locks - Guy kept his hair back, in a tight ponytail. Jackson's hair fell loose, past his shoulders. They both wore a dark jacket, no tie, and a light-coloured shirt. Guy's shirt was pale blue; Jackson's was pink.
But the similarities ended there.
Once their political views diverged, so did father and son. A few years ago, Jackson was ""moderately left"", he testified, while his father was ""moderately right"". That changed with Trump's election in 2016. Afterwards, Jackson said, they began to shift: ""We both went further in our own direction.""
""I have never known Guy to be violent,"" says his older brother, Nathan Reffitt, who attended the trial
The rift between the father and son was profound, eating away at their family. Guy's older brother, Nathan Reffitt, a 50-year-old electrician, called Jackson a ""snowflake"" and overly sensitive.
""My nephew turned against his father,"" Nathan told the BBC while attending his brother's trial. ""It's sad that our country has come to this.""
After giving media interviews, Jackson moved out of his parents' home in early 2021, using a crowdfunding campaign to support himself. Despite his differences with his family, Jackson has remained close to some of them.

During an afternoon break in the courthouse, in the midst of three hours of testimony, Jackson saw his older sister Sarah, 24, in a hallway. ""Look at you,"" he called to her, admiring her stylish outfit: she wore a black top, stilettos and carried a Kate Spade bag. He ran up to her, and they hugged. They both cried for a moment before he was ushered back into the courtroom.
Sarah described her father as a loving, gentle man. ""Even the things he says that sounds like he would be violent,"" she told the BBC, her voice trailing off. ""He doesn't hurt anyone."" She remembered that it was always their father the children would turn to if they would get into any trouble, because he was so forgiving.
As father and son moved to the right and the left, respectively, the atmosphere at their house became fraught. Outside the family home, the Reffitts flew a Texas Three Percenters flag, showing support for a militia group (members claim only three percent of people in the colonies took up arms against the British during the American revolution).
Guy kept a Smith & Wesson 40-calibre handgun on his bedside table and carried it around the house, into the kitchen, the living room, everywhere. He communicated with his family on a group chat, sounding off about corrupt politicians in Washington.
""Time to remove them,"" he wrote in late December 2020 in a message, one that prosecutors displayed on courtroom screens. ""That's why I'm going to DC.""
During this time, Trump was looking for a way to stay in power. ""What comes next is about tyranny,"" Guy wrote in another text that month, hinting at what he planned to do in the nation's capital: ""Hold my beer and I'll show you.""
Family and friends, gathered in the courthouse on that day and throughout the trial, said that Guy's texts and remarks have been blown out of proportion.
Guy's wife, Nicole, 48, a woman with short, white-blonde hair who chain-smoked during court breaks, claimed he was a big talker, and that she and their children joked about it: ""We say: 'Don't do a Guy.'"" That means swearing a blue streak, the way he does, or trying to out-do someone or impress them.

During one of these breaks, Nicole sat near her mother-in-law, Linda Reffitt, 74, who lives in an RV and travelled with her oldest son, Nathan, to Washington DC for the trial. The afternoon sun streamed into the room, as they recalled Guy's foul language, some of which he had recorded in a video on 6 January.
Prosecutors played the audio in the courtroom. In the recording, Guy Reffitt talked about the Speaker of the US House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, referring to her in abusive language while speaking of a vague plan for ""dragging"" her out of the Capitol.
At moments like these, Nicole wished she could slink out of the room, she told the BBC. Still, she said, it's all just talk: her husband, she insisted, is not a threat to anyone.
He was sentenced on Monday for five felony counts, including obstructing an official proceeding of Congress; trespassing at the Capitol while carrying a holstered semiautomatic handgun; interfering with police in a riot; and witness tampering.
Reffitt's conviction is a result of the sprawling federal investigation into the 6 January riot, which has resulted in prosecutors bringing charges against hundreds of individuals.
After the verdict, Nicole claimed her husband was used as an example to make all the one-sixers (6 January defendants) take a plea. ""Do not take a plea one-sixers,"" she urged, ""we got this.""
Jackson, meanwhile, tweeted that it was ""impossible to be happy"" about the verdict. ""My father could have possibly been home by now getting mental help if he took a plea deal,"" he added.

When asked what the family name, Reffitt, means, Sarah looked it up on her phone. ""It means 'powerful and peace',"" she said with a sad smile. ""Very ironic."" Then she nodded her head and said the name reflected who her father was, and that she was not surprised to see the meaning of their family name: ""Makes sense to me.""
She said that a desire for one-upmanship fuelled her father; it caused him to not only swear like a sailor, but also drove him to Washington DC.
Specifically, she said, he wanted to show Jackson the kind of man that he is.
""He's always trying to impress Jackson,"" she said. ""And he didn't really impress anyone.""

229,229,Fact-checking PM's claim about refugees,"Wed, 09 Mar 2022 18:22:06 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/60679290,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/60679290?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,The PM claimed the UK had done more to resettle vulnerable people than any other European country.,"Fact-checking Boris Johnson's claim about refugees
Boris Johnson was asked at Wednesday's Prime Minister's Questions about the UK's policy on admitting Ukrainian refugees.
He said: ""This government has a proud, proud record. We've done more to resettle vulnerable people than any other European country since 2015."" 
Mr Johnson has made this claim before, which the government says applies to ""resettled refugees"". 
He is right about this one category of refugees, but the overall picture is very different, as some other European countries have taken in far more refugees than the UK since 2015.
Resettled refugees
Resettled refugees are people who are admitted to the UK from another country where they had initially sought refuge. This would apply, for example, to someone who had fled the war in Syria and was now living in a camp in Jordan. 
The UK operates three resettlement schemes: 
The UK Resettlement Scheme for vulnerable refugees, including survivors of violence and torture, women, children and people with medical needs. The government works with the UN's refugee agency, which assesses refugees for resettlement
The Community Sponsorship Scheme enables community groups to directly welcome and support a resettled family into their local community 
The Mandate Resettlement Scheme resettles refugees with a close family member in the UK who is willing to accommodate them
Between 2015 and 2020 (the years for which comparable data exists), the UK admitted about 24,700 resettled refugees - the majority of them Syrians. 
This was higher than France, which resettled about 16,300 people, and Germany with about 14,500. 
Overall refugee figures 
Resettlement schemes are just one part of the asylum system. 
The majority of those who flee their home country, and cannot safely return to it, seek refuge by applying for asylum in another country.
When you factor in the number of people who were granted asylum since 2015, then the picture changes dramatically.
It is clear that looking at the overall numbers of refugees allowed to stay, several European countries are way ahead of the UK.
If you add up the number of resettled refugees and those who were granted asylum, the UK gave refuge to just over 92,000 people from around the world from 2015 to 2020. 
Germany, by contrast, gave refuge to more than one million people.
France, Sweden, Italy and Spain all outperformed the UK over the same period.
And if you look at the figures in proportion to a country's overall population, the UK has provided refuge to 121 people per 100,000. 
On that measure, 20 other European countries have taken in more refugees than the UK. 
Sweden, with 1,619 refugees per 100,000 people leads in Europe, followed by Germany with 1,274, Austria with 1,134 and Switzerland with 955.

230,230,Israel's Bennett plays peacemaker in Ukraine-Russia war,"Thu, 10 Mar 2022 00:57:16 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-60679175,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-60679175?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,"Prime Minister Naftali Bennett is an unlikely mediator between Kyiv and Moscow, Tom Bateman says.","Israel's Bennett plays peacemaker in Ukraine-Russia war
Naftali Bennett says it is a moral obligation to make every effort to extend dialogue
Early in the morning, as Russia's isolation grew, a jet took off from Tel Aviv bound for Moscow. It happened in secret, carrying a VIP delegation. The plane touched down with a reverse thrust: a hot blast into Moscow's dawn while Russia was being frozen out by the West.
This was last Saturday - incidentally the Jewish Sabbath, when tradition says the rest day can be broken to save a life. Onboard were at least two observant Jews working when they normally wouldn't - Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett and Housing Minister Zeev Elkin, plus four officials. Mr Elkin was there, it was said, to help with the translation. He's a native Russian speaker, born and brought up in Kharkiv, the Ukrainian city under relentless Russian bombardment. He has close relatives there; now he was going to meet the war's architect.
The Israelis headed to the Kremlin. Mr Bennett was the first foreign leader to speak to Vladimir Putin in person in response to the invasion of Ukraine. We don't know much about the meeting, whether they were sat six metres (20ft) apart across that glossy white table (the treatment European leaders got in the run up to war). None of the substance leaked at the time. There was nothing to see and little to hear. An invisible liaison.
But the meeting itself was the story. Could Israel be the unlikely broker in the worst crisis between Russia and the West since the Cold War?
News of the meeting was released as it reached its third hour, making global headlines. 
Officials from Ukraine and Russia have been holding face-to-face talks in Belarus
Israel has significant relations with both Russia and Ukraine, and Mr Bennett had been trying to position himself as a go-between. 
There are some immediate concerns for the Israelis. There are at least a quarter of a million Jews in Ukraine, eligible to make Israel their home under its ""Law of Return"". 
But Mr Bennett was flying into something he sees as strategic in the crisis. 
Israel has also developed frequent dialogue with the Russians, or ""our neighbours to the north"" as one official reportedly referred to them recently. Russia controls the skies over Syria, where Israel routinely carries out air strikes. It says it targets weapons transfers and militants linked to Iran, the country it sees as an existential threat. 
Now the relationship dynamics of one regional crisis are becoming entangled in another.
Israel will take in 5,000 Ukrainian refugees and allow 20,000 others who arrived before the war to stay temporarily
Israel's leadership believes its Russia links are an opening. One Israeli official put it to me that it can be a ""bridge"" between Moscow and the West. Prime Minister Bennett even called it a moral obligation to make every effort to extend dialogue.
There have been three rounds of direct talks between Ukrainian and Russian officials in Belarus. The first attempts at local ceasefires to allow so-called humanitarian corridors barely held, under disputed circumstances. 
Any terms of a more permanent truce go to the roots of the crisis. Russia demands that Ukraine declares itself ""neutral"", permanently renounces future Nato membership, and gives up chunks of territory. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky promises to fight on. He says he is ready for dialogue, but ""not for capitulation"".
It's unlikely Israel can play mediator in the usual sense of a powerful arbiter that tries to entice each party into concessions. It would have to be more of a message carrier, shuttling between unequal sides. Some question the value of such an attempt. 
Some protesters in Israel have called on the government to help Ukraine resist the Russian invasion
Israel's leadership has decided largely not to fall in with the West's approach to Russia. It has not, for example, joined much of the barrage of fresh sanctions against Moscow. 
This is a gamble on helping create an environment of de-escalation, but it's high risk.
It has sparked a fiery debate within Israel. First, when it didn't sign up to a text condemning Russia at the UN Security Council. Some called this a serious mistake - alienating the US, Israel's long-time ally. There was some direct criticism of Russia, but it was left to the Foreign Minister, Yair Lapid. Israel did eventually join the vote to condemn Moscow at the UN General Assembly.
Israeli officials are at pains to say the Kremlin meeting had the blessing of the US. But one veteran Israeli journalist quoted American officials as being sceptical about Mr Bennett's moves, thinking it unlikely that he could change Mr Putin's mind. Since then, more reported details of their calls have emerged, with Israeli officials quoted as suggesting Russian and Ukrainian positions in talks may be ""softening"". It was the first significant piece of news about any kind of broader agreement and is likely to give energy to Israel's efforts.
However, other commentators caution that only a fool could trust Vladimir Putin now.

Israel is prepared to be a go-between. It believes it's a card that should be kept on the table, which the West can play if it needs. Of course, it's not the only lens in the Middle East through which the war is seen. 
Many in Arab countries, having lived the aftershocks of American and British invasions, condemn the West for what they see as its double standards over Ukraine. Palestinians point to Western backing for Ukrainian resistance and celebration of its leaders and ask: What about us? Israeli critics of this argument have been very vocal too, saying there is no equivalence between the two conflicts.
Meanwhile Turkey, historically a bridge between East and West, is also in the fray for dialogue between Russia and Ukraine. It's hosting their foreign ministers in the Mediterranean city of Antalya.
As for Mr Zelensky, he has welcomed Israel's potential mediation, but revealed frustration too. The Ukrainian president was asked whether, as a Jewish man, he had expectations of the Jewish state? ""Our relations are not bad, not bad at all,"" he said. But he added, referring to Mr Bennett: ""I don't think he is wrapped in our flag.""
Perhaps that's what's needed from a potential mediator. Mr Zelensky has thanked the Israeli leader for attempts to ""end the war"". But that still feels a dim prospect despite Saturday's diplomatic flurry. Since then, the calls have continued, but the roar of the jet to Moscow has fallen silent.

231,231,Winter Paralympics: 'I chose to have my leg amputated after years of pain',"Thu, 10 Mar 2022 01:16:37 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/disability-60642118,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/disability-60642118?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,Musician Shona chose to have her leg amputated after years of pain - now she's a Paralympian.,"Winter Paralympics: 'I chose to have my leg amputated after years of pain'
When musician Shona Brownlee had a fall at the end of her military training she didn't think much of it - but after years of chronic pain she made a life-changing decision which unexpectedly took her to this year's Winter Paralympics in Beijing. 
Shona had been passionate about the French horn since childhood. 
""Music is all I ever wanted to do,"" she says. ""My evenings and weekends were taken up with orchestra practices and concerts.""
Shona, from Livingston in Scotland, studied music at the highest level, first at Birmingham Conservatoire and then Arizona State University in America.
But life as a freelance musician was tough. Orchestral players are often only paid for the one or two rehearsals before a concert and then the performance itself. And it was unpredictable.
She knew of friends who had joined the RAF as musicians, for stability.   
""I'd always thought the military wasn't for me. But when I went to visit them and sat in on a couple of rehearsals you realise that the job is exactly the same as a civilian musician. 
""You're in a uniform, but you get the rehearsals, you get the concerts, the travel and world class bands.""
Shona applied to the RAF and was accepted as an aircraftwoman. Even with a focus on music she still had to meet the same entry requirements as all of the other recruits and complete basic training before she got to play.
There were a few lifestyle changes too. As well as fitness tests and early starts ""we marched everywhere,"" Shona smiles. ""You have to march between whatever lessons you've got,"" from service knowledge to weapon handling.
As Shona approached the end of basic training, she let herself imagine what her musical career would be like.
And then she fell.
""It was a simple accident,"" she says of the fall from a ledge into a loading bay, and she thought nothing of it. Her ankle was sore, but she presumed it was sprained and would be fine soon enough. 
She pushed herself to finish training and joined the band, but ""band drill"" - more marching - was out. She could barely walk.
Shona was referred to the famous Headley Court Defence Medical Rehabilitation Centre and diagnosed with complex regional pain syndrome which causes severe persistent and disabling pain. She tried various treatments from intensive rehabilitation to surgery. 
""Nothing worked,"" she says. ""I was stuck on crutches with a leg that didn't work.""
Shona continued to work with the RAF band, but on those occasions when she had to perform and march at the same time - one of its key components - she had to sit-out. It was frustrating and she hoped that one day a treatment would work. 
After six years, without success, Shona's medical team called her into a meeting: ""There was nothing more that could be done,"" they told her.
But Shona knew that wasn't quite true.
Over the years, she had made friends with wounded veterans.
""Double or triple amputees who were so much more functional than I was because they were on prosthetics,"" she says.
And she recalled a quip a friend had made years before - ""you should have it chopped off"". 
Shona knew he hadn't been entirely joking, he himself had elected to have a leg amputation.
""At the time, I was a bit horrified and thought 'I'd rather have a wonky leg than no leg', but as time goes on, you think 'that's not such a bad thing'.""
Shona began to research the possibility and when she decided it was for her, she mentioned it to her medical team at Headley Court. 
They took ""a bit of convincing,"" she says and spent a long time discussing all the pros and cons with her, including how she may be left with phantom limb pain. There was also the chance it might not work or she might not get on with a prosthetic.
Shona was willing to take the risk.
""After six years on crutches it seemed almost like there wasn't a decision to make because my leg wasn't working,"" she says. ""I had nothing to lose. 
""I elected to have my leg amputated below the knee.""
Shona says coming to the decision herself helped her come to terms with the life-changing operation, even if she had to convince others.
But even with this conviction, on the day of the operation, she felt nervous. She had no idea if it would work and leave her pain free.  
When Shona came around from the anaesthetic, she looked down.
""There was just a weird little bump where my leg should have been, but I do remember thinking 'it doesn't hurt, that's a good sign'.""
Shona spent a week in hospital followed by six weeks using a wheelchair to ensure the stump healed before she got fitted for her prosthetic leg.
""I found it easier to adapt to than I was expecting,"" she says. ""It felt strange at first,"" and she had to learn to take care  to avoid blisters and sores. ""But within a couple of months it felt normal."" 
She was even able to march with the RAF band for the first time.  
While Shona underwent rehab she spotted an advert for the RAF's Battle Back programme which provides sport and adventure to injured and sick service people as part of their rehabilitation.
It was advertising a ski trip to Bavaria. 
Shona signed up. ""It was going to be a nice little 10-day jolly, but that was the beginning of my skiing career,"" she says.
Shona tried a sit-ski - an encased seat mounted on a single ski. Two handheld outriggers are used for balance and direction control. 
""It was terrifying, but I really enjoyed it,"" she says. ""It's a little like riding a bike. At first it's quite wobbly but once you've found your balance point and your centre of gravity then it's Ok.
""I wouldn't say I picked it up particularly easily. I remember a lot of times being upside down, sliding down the hill head first, ending up in ditches.""
Despite the crashes, someone spotted Shona's potential and introduced her to the Armed Forces Para-Snowsport Team (AFPST) which provides ski opportunities to injured service people as well as coaching and equipment.
The organisation also supported Para-nordic skier Scott Meenagh and snowboarder Owen Pick at this year's Paralympic Games.
Between rehab and work, Shona started training properly and, with the support of the AFPST began to compete under the classification - LW12-2 - for athletes with amputations of the lower limbs.
Over the last 12 months, Shona's career has taken off - first she made the British team, then competed in her first World Cup event and made the podium twice. 
This week she made her debut at the Winter Paralympics. She finished 6th in her first event, the Super-G, and while she was in 5th place after the downhill of the super combined, which also includes slalom, she did not finish the second element. She finished 9th in both the giant slalom and slalom.
""It just snowballed,"" she says.
Shona is now part of the RAF's elite athlete scheme which allows service people to take time out from their assigned jobs and train full-time. She was also named RAF Sportswoman of the Year 2021.
It has been a golden time, but as much as Shona would love a gold medal, Beijing 2022 has been more about the experience.
""I feel like this is my warm-up,"" she says. ""Learn from it and then build on it in another cycle.
 ""But the eventual goal? I will still go back to the band and be a musician again.""

232,232,Drought robs Amazon communities of 'life-giving' river,"Thu, 10 Mar 2022 01:13:51 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-60601711,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-60601711?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,Low water levels mean riverside communities lose much of their income and their mode of transport.,"Drought robs Amazon communities of 'life-giving' river
Boats sit on sandy soil where a river in Colombia's Amazon region would normally be flowing
Orlando Rufino stands in the bed of the river that he says has been ""life-giving"" for his people for hundreds of years.
""It's life, because it's what gives us everything,"" he explains. 
A key source of transport, food and income for families like Mr Rufino's, the river has always snaked through dense jungle in southern Colombia, eventually linking up with the mighty Amazon.
But instead of wading through water, his feet sink into dry sand. Wooden boats that normally travel along its steady current sit forgotten next to him.
""Even during droughts, it has always gone up to here,"" Mr Rufino, 43, says, holding his hand over his head. ""Right now, it's critical.""
Orlando Rufino points to a tree trunk to show how high the river level would be normally
Historically, the dry season in the region runs from July to December. While the river level goes down during this time, it almost always remains deep enough for boats to travel, Mr Rufino says.
But over the past five years, the droughts have gradually worsened. This year, it has stretched for months longer than normal. 
Usually metres deep, right now the river is little more than a trickle. 
Such low water levels pose an existential threat to the estimated 30 million people that call the Amazon basin home, including Mr Rufino's indigenous Ticuna people. 
Mr Rufino relies on the river and its fish to feed his family
The director of the Foundation for Conservation and Sustainable Development, Rodrigo Botero, says that climate change is to blame for the increased frequency of the droughts.
""And the ones who suffer are the people with the fewest resources,"" he adds.
Mr Botero, a scientist working across Colombia's Amazon region, has documented the destruction over the past decades.
Dubbed ""the lungs of the planet"", the Amazon basin's 6.9 million square kilometres (2.7m sq miles) of rainforest - land more than twice the size of India - has suffered rampant deforestation, which fuels climate change.
Roughly 15% of that forest has been destroyed across Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, French Guiana, Guyana, Peru, Suriname and Venezuela since 1978, data gathered by the non-profit conservation news platform Mongabay suggests.
""Between deforestation and these massive droughts... local communities face more new problems every day,"" warns Mr Botero.
Deisi Sánchez Parente worries about what the future may look like for her children
Deisi Sánchez Parente Bóatakü is one of those affected by the dropping river levels. 
The 33-year-old who lives in San Pedro de los Lagos - deep in Colombia's Amazon region, near the border with Peru and Brazil - normally sends her children to school by boat. 
But with river levels too low to navigate, their half-hour journey has turned into a two-hour trek on foot through dense jungle terrain. 
Every day, she wakes her children up at 03:30 to make it to school in time. ""Sometimes they tell me: 'Mommy, I don't want to go to class, it's too far.'""
When the river is too low to go by boat, school children have to get up extra early
For Mr Rufino, a fisherman and farmer, the drought means that half of his work has evaporated. Fish have moved to deeper waters and the community struggles to water its crops, he explains. 
And even when he and his fellow farmers manage to grow something, they cannot take it to market without boats. 
""You lose money, because there is no way to sell anything. There's no transport,"" he says.
The river is key for taking goods to market
Mr Botero says that in some extreme cases he has seen livestock die due to lack of water. Wild animals that communities normally hunt for food migrate to places where water is more abundant. 
He warns that food scarcity could increase further in populations that already face disproportionately high rates of malnutrition.
Indigenous communities have repeatedly sounded the alarm about the effects the drought could have on approximately 350 different ethnic groups in the region.
The river is the lifeblood of many communities who dwell by its banks
""We don't want any more speeches. We are facing an Amazon that's at the point of no return,"" the head of the Coordination of Indigenous Organizations of the Amazon Basin, José Gregorio Díaz, told a press conference recently, as United Nations leaders met to discuss the issue.
To make matters worse, large swathes of Colombia's Amazon region have been ravaged by forest fires since the beginning of the year. 
While data on the fires is still not available, the country's environmental ministry published a memo in January saying they appeared to be the worst the region had experienced in a decade. 
""What is happening is unheard of,"" says Mr Botero. ""It's one of the biggest fires that I've seen in 10 years. Really, it's an apocalyptic situation.""
The fear is that in long term the fires will contribute to changing climate conditions, thrusting the region into a vicious cycle of burns and drought.
Children have been taking advantage of the low river levels to play, but the drought is causing huge problems
Back in her small community, Ms Sánchez Parente is feeding her baby in her small brick home. She says she worries about what the future may look like for her children.
""It never used to be like this,"" she says. ""They're things that make you sad, because everything has changed so much.""

233,233,Kidney donor: I call my remaining one Home Alone Kevin,"Thu, 10 Mar 2022 01:18:17 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-60661268,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-60661268?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,"Azeem Ahmad, who donated one of his kidneys to a stranger, says, years on, he still has no regrets.","Kidney donor: I call my remaining one Home Alone Kevin
Azeem Ahmad, 35, from Newcastle, became a living kidney donor for someone he did not know, in 2019. 
Since Covid hit, kidney transplants and altruistic donations have dropped considerably. 
NHS Blood and Transplant is urging people to think about whether they might be willing to be a donor and to share their decision with family and friends. 
Azeem says, for him, it was an easy but carefully considered choice. 
A healthy person can lead a normal life with only one functioning kidney.
Azeem does not know who received his kidney - but he knows he has helped improve their life. 
Rare condition
More than 4,600 people, including nearly 100 children, in the UK, are waiting for a kidney transplant.
The pandemic means about 1,100 fewer patients received a kidney transplant in 2020-21 than the year before. 
Most organ donations follow death but people can donate some in life - most commonly, a kidney. 
Alisha Gokani, 23, from Kent, has been waiting years for a kidney transplant. 
A rare condition meant her own failed before she reached her teens. 
When she was 19, her mother, herself seriously ill, donated one of her kidneys - but Alisha's body rejected it.
Since then, Alisha has relied on dialysis.
And as an undergraduate, it has been difficult. 
'Complete exhaustion'
""I've had to completely rearrange my life, taking time away from university initially,"" Alisha says, ""but thankfully I was able to return. 
""Every day is a struggle, as I'm faced with complete exhaustion from having treatment four times a week alongside full-time education.
""I have been told that a living donor from the same ethnicity as me would be the best possible match. 
""As I have had a transplant before, my body has created a lot of antibodies, which provides extra challenges, so I could be waiting a very long time. 
""If a live donor came forward, my antibodies can be removed to match the donor's, just before surgery.
""Everything could be planned and controlled for the best possible outcome.
""Living donation is a big ask and something that shouldn't be taken lightly.
""But I am kindly asking people to read more about organ donation, talk to their family and discuss their decision.""
'Helping someone'
Azeem was motivated to act after reading a tweet by former Wales goalkeeper Neville Southall, external on behalf of the family of a young girl who needed a kidney. 
""I thought that I should see if I could be a match and so I got in touch with the local hospital,"" he tells BBC News.
The doctors gave him lots of information about the procedure. 
""The more I knew, the more I decided it was the right thing for me to do,"" Azeem says.
""Helping someone and potentially saving their life for a few days of discomfort seemed absolutely worth it. 
""I was already a blood and stem-cell donor, so it felt like the right thing to do - I wanted to help."" 
And when tests revealed he would not be a match for the young girl, Azeem decided to go ahead with donation if another patient who did match was found.
'Right thing'
Azeem admits he was ""bricking it"" on the day of the operation. 
""I knew that I could still change my mind,"" he says, ""but I'm so pleased that I went through with the donation.
""I don't think it is for everyone - but for me, it was definitely the right thing to do. 
""And my family and friends were really supportive about my decision when they understood how and why I had reached it.""
'Doing great'
It took weeks to recover from the keyhole procedure - but Azeem is back to full health. 
And his kidney function, which the doctors check regularly, is ""really good"". 
""I've called my remaining kidney Kevin - because he is Home Alone,"" Azeem jokes, in a reference to Macaulay Culkin's character in the 1990 comedy film.
""He's doing great - he's grown in size and function."" 
'Really hard'
Azeem received a card and message from the person given his kidney, which he says was extremely moving. 
""It hit me really hard,"" he says.
""It meant so much to me. 
""Most people are prepared to give a little for the benefit of others. 
""The pandemic has shown us that too.""

234,234,The Marvellous Neil Baldwin is back to make us feel better,"Thu, 10 Mar 2022 01:20:18 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-60624134,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-60624134?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,"Baldwin was played by Toby Jones in the Bafta-winning BBC film Marvellous, which is now on stage.","The Marvellous Neil Baldwin is back to make us feel better
Actor Toby Jones (left) and Neil Baldwin with one of the Bafta Awards for their TV drama Marvellous
Neil Baldwin was taken to the nation's hearts thanks to the Bafta-winning BBC film Marvellous, in which he was played by Toby Jones. He has now helped create a theatre version.
People who get their life stories turned into films and plays are usually celebrities or politicians or those who have done something particularly heroic or remarkable. On the face of it, Neil Baldwin is an unlikely subject.
He's a former clown and Stoke City kit man who wasn't well-known - at least beyond his Staffordshire home town - and hasn't been at the centre of any daring or dramatic historical events.
But viewers who watched the heartwarming Marvellous in 2014 came to realise he is remarkable and heroic in his own way.

Toby Jones: 'Neil has an inspiring attitude in seizing life'
They saw his uncanny ability to spread positivity and endear himself to everybody he meets, from students to archbishops to footballers.
They also saw how he always manages to get what he wants and keep going in the face of adversity, his learning difficulties anything but an obstacle.
""When I saw it, I thought, that's a good film,"" he says now. ""The best film ever made. And I still think it is.""
Marvellous won three Baftas in 2015 including best single drama, and was also showered with prizes from the Royal Television Society, Broadcasting Press Guild and Monte Carlo TV Festival.
Since then, Baldwin has received other honours including the freedom of Stoke-on-Trent and the British Empire Medal for services to the community in Newcastle-under-Lyme.
He now wears that medal everywhere, and has it pinned to the lapel of his jacket when he comes to Newcastle-under-Lyme's New Vic theatre to discuss the stage adaptation.
He has created the show with the venue's artistic director Theresa Heskins, and it is finally reaching the stage after lengthy pandemic-enforced delays.
""Three times it was postponed because of the pandemic,"" says Heskins, who has joined Baldwin in the theatre's lounge during a break from rehearsals.
She says to him: ""Every time I phoned you, I thought, how am I going to tell Neil?
""He made me feel better every single time. I'd phone him up feeling dreadful about it, and then I'd put the phone down feeling so much better - which is Neil's special power.""
The cast members take it in turns to play Baldwin in the stage show
The play will have its official opening night on Baldwin's 76th birthday, on Tuesday.
Former Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams recently conducted a special service in Baldwin's honour to mark his 62 years on campus at Keele University, where his mother worked as a cleaner and where the young Baldwin made himself a popular presence and unofficial mascot.
A far back as 1968, he was granted honorary life membership of the students' union, and he received an honorary degree in 2013.
His love of making people laugh led him to join the circus as Nello the clown in 1980. His other passions include Stoke City FC, and when he introduced himself to new manager Lou Macari in 1991, Macari decided Baldwin would be a force for good in the dressing room.
He made Baldwin the kit man and described him as ""my best-ever signing"".

""His real value was in helping the players relax before games,"" Macari wrote in his autobiography. ""No chemist ever produced a drug that could reduce stress levels like Nello. I was convinced that this gave us an edge in matches. Nello bonded the group.""
Baldwin has even run his own football club, named Neil Baldwin FC, at Keele University since 1967, asking the likes of Kevin Keegan and Gary Lineker to serve stints as its president. They agreed, of course.
Baldwin published his autobiography in 2015 and when they started work on the play, he and Heskins went through his life story with a set of actors.
""We'd say to Neil, 'There's this bit in the autobiography, could you tell us a little bit more about that?"" Heskins explains.
""He'd tell us, then we'd try to re-stage that. While the actors were improvising, Neil would say, 'I think I did that and I said that.' And then we'd do those things.""
She adds, addressing Baldwin: ""Always, whenever we wanted to get a bit serious, you'd be the person that would always be telling us, 'Wouldn't it be funny if she had itching powder in her skirt now?'""

The world could do with more of Neil Baldwin's spirit-lifting powers. So what is his secret of staying upbeat?
""I just stay positive,"" he replies simply, before recalling a conversation with a young friend whose mother had recently died.
""He rung me up on Christmas Day and said, 'Why do you keep on being happy?' I said, 'Life is very short sometimes and you've got to keep happy.'""
Heskins has tried to dig deeper. ""Remember that time I trapped you in the auditorium for two hours?"" she says to him. ""I wouldn't let you out until you answered exactly that question. What is your recipe for happiness?
""You kept saying to me, 'Just be happy.' And I kept saying, 'What if some people can't? Offer me some concrete ideas.'
""You said, 'Get a pet. Sing. Have friends.' You said to me, 'I know I live on my own, but I've got that many friends.' And you said, 'That's one of the keys to being happy, having people.'
""You have all those friends and you are lovely to them. You make people feel good about themselves by being so kind to them, and that makes people happy. That feels like your amazing recipe for happiness. And also laughing.""
""Oh yeah,"" Baldwin says. ""I always do try to keep laughing. Sometimes people do get upset. But you've always got life to live.""
Royal approval
Baldwin's trademark positivity was justified when it came to making Marvellous. ""Before the film ever came out, I said, 'We're going to London to the Baftas.' [Writer] Peter Bowker says, 'Don't be a fool.' I said, 'You'll be the fool if we win.' And we won.""
That film opened doors for Baldwin to make even more friends in high places. A devout royalist, he recounts a visit to Buckingham Palace, one of his proudest days.
""William and Kate were there and William said to me, 'You've won a Bafta haven't you? What a film that was.'
""And I said to Kate, 'What lovely children you've got.' She said, 'Thank you, sir.' I turned around and said, 'I'm not a sir till you make me one!'""
Marvellous made Baldwin something approaching a national treasure, and there's still room for more gongs on his lapel.
Marvellous runs at the New Vic theatre in Newcastle-under-Lyme from 11 March to 9 April.

235,235,England in West Indies: Tourists bowlers blunted on attritional second day in Antigua,"Wed, 09 Mar 2022 23:00:57 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/cricket/60665830,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/cricket/60665830?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,A mixed showing from England's bowlers allows West Indies to edge an attritional second day of the first Test in Antigua.,"England in West Indies: Tourists bowlers blunted on attritional second day in Antigua
West Indies were 127-4 before an unbroken partnership lasting 31.4 overs from Bonner and Holder took the hosts to the close
First Test, Sir Vivian Richards Stadium, Antigua (day two):
England 311: Bairstow 140, Foakes 42; Seales 4-79
West Indies 202-4: Brathwaite 55, Holder 43*; Stokes 1-20
West Indies trail by 109 runs
Scorecard
A mixed showing from England's bowlers allowed West Indies to edge an attritional second day of the first Test in Antigua.
The tourists took 4-44 in the afternoon session but struggled otherwise as West Indies closed on 202-4, 109 runs behind.
Without James Anderson and Stuart Broad, England were wayward with the new ball and the hosts raced to 83-0, captain Kraigg Brathwaite making 55 from 70 balls.
England's seamers, helped by some poor shot-making, wrestled back the momentum but Nkrumah Bonner and Jason Holder blunted the bowling in the final session with a watchful, unbroken stand of 75.
England had earlier added 43 runs for their last four wickets before being dismissed for 311.
Jonny Bairstow, who resumed on 109, was last man out for 140, while 20-year-old seamer Jayden Seales took 4-79 for the hosts at the start of a day interrupted by a series of short rain delays.

West Indies hold the edge 
Day one was all about whether England's batters could respond to their Ashes humiliation. After West Indies quickly wrapped up the lower-order in the morning session, attention turned to England's new-look bowling attack on day two.
Once England chose to look to the future and leave Anderson and Broad, their two leading wicket-takers in Tests who have shown little sign of slowing down, out of this series comparisons were always going to be made. 
Ultimately, despite all taking a wicket, this seam attack of Chris Woakes, Craig Overton, Mark Wood and all-rounder Ben Stokes allowed West Indies to move into the ascendency. 
In the veterans' absence, Woakes was the leader of the attack but was particularly wayward on a slow pitch with little support through the air.
Overton, opening the bowling for England for the first time, rarely threatened either side of making the first breakthrough. He had opener John Campbell caught down the leg side for 35.
Wood carried the most threat, as ever bowling with express pace. 
He produced a probing spell of reverse swing after tea but Holder, who scored a double century on England's last tour to the Caribbean, frustrated the tourists again and, having come in at 127-4 with England on top, found able support in 33-year-old Bonner, playing his 10th Test
Holder ended unbeaten on 43 and Bonner 34, ensuring West Indies hold the edge in this Test.
England fight back after woeful start
Woakes ended with figures of 1-54 from 12 overs
The fact England limited the scoring ensured West Indies were not able to pull away after being gifted a quick start.
In a 10-over spell before lunch England failed to hold their line and length or create opportunities. 
Brathwaite, usually the grittiest of openers, was able to race to his fastest Test fifty from 62 balls, the bowling sprayed down both sides of the wicket.
Left-arm spinner Jack Leach, who was accurate but largely unthreatening throughout, was brought on after just eight overs and all five bowlers were used by 23 overs.
Sparked into life by Overton's bouncer to dismiss Campbell, England did improve, however. 
Wood unsettled Brathwaite with a bumper and the opener slashed a full, wide ball to gully. Shamarh Brooks nicked Stokes to first slip for 18 and Woakes had Jermaine Blackwood caught after a review showed a looped catch taken at gully had flicked inside edge before thigh pad.
The slow pitch and a softening ball did not help England's quest for wickets late in the day.
Earlier, Bairstow did at least ensure they passed 300 for the first time this winter at the sixth attempt before he skied a catch off Alzarri Joseph when trying to add quick lower-order runs.
'Our lengths were poor' - reaction
England bowler Mark Wood: ""It was a little bit indifferent. There were parts we bowled really well and parts we were disappointed with how we bowled. The first 15-20 overs we didn't get it right. When we came back after lunch we did really well. 
""There is so much talk around Broad and Anderson we know we are going to be compared to them. We have to do our best. We are never going to be a Jimmy and Broady.
""The disappointing bit for us is we didn't get the start right.""
BBC cricket correspondent Jonathan Agnew: ""I can understand Chris Woakes being nervous. For years it has been Broad and Anderson. He has enormous boots to fill. 
""It is a very slow pitch. There is nothing in it at all. 
""It was a very valuable partnership between Bonner and Holder. The second new ball will probably determine whether England have a lead out of this.""

Tiger Woods' daughter Sam was born the day after he finished joint second at the 2007 US Open
The Players Championship
Venue: Stadium Course, Sawgrass, Florida Date: 10-13 March
Coverage: Live text updates of Saturday and Sunday's third and fourth rounds on BBC Sport website from 18:00 GMT, live commentary on BBC Radio 5 Live Sports Extra of final round from 20:40 GMT, plus in-play clips.
An emotional Tiger Woods choked back the tears as he was inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame on Wednesday after a moving speech by his 14-year-old daughter Sam.
After Sam spoke of not knowing if her father would emerge in one piece from last year's horrific car crash, Woods recalled battling racism as a junior player and the support of his parents, coaches and friends.
""I didn't get here alone,"" said the 46-year-old American. ""I had unbelievable parents, mentors and friends who supported me in the darkest of times and celebrated the highest of times.
""It's actually a team award. All of you allowed me to get here and I just want to say thank you from the bottom of my heart.""
It is unclear whether Woods will return to the game. He moved slowly on the stage, suddenly looking all of his years and clearly still feeling the effects of the crash in February 2021, but his importance to the game is still huge. 
He recently won the PGA Tour's Player Impact Programme, and with it $8m (£6m), for generating more media interest than any other golfer in 2021 - even though he played just one exhibition tournament in 2021. 
His last official PGA Tour event was the 2020 Masters but last November a social media post of him hitting golf balls under the title ""making progress"" attracted 7.8 million views on Twitter.
In a glittering career Woods has won 15 majors - second only to Jack Nicklaus' 18 - and a joint record 82 times on the PGA Tour with Sam Snead. 
And in a recorded video message, Nicklaus paid tribute by saying ""I first saw him when has about 13. I watched this skinny kid hit a few balls and I was told he'd be good. I said we'd see about that. We've now seen.""
PGA Tour commissioner Jay Monahan said: ""Sport needs hype. Not many people live up to it. Tiger exceeded it.""
His list of playing achievements is lengthy, including spending a record 683 weeks as world number one, but he is also recognised for his work with his TGR Foundation, set up in 1996 to improve the health, education and welfare of children.
His own golfing career started in humble fashion. He recounted tales of searching for golf balls to be able to practice, and of putting for quarters and dollars, which he said, with a smile, that his late father Earl frowned upon.
Woods encountered racism when going to junior tournaments. ""I was not allowed into the clubhouses. The colour of my skin dictated that,"" he said.
""I had to change my shoes in the car. As I got older that drove me even more.""
The tears came when he talked about his parents taking out a second mortgage to fund his golf when he was 14 and the fact he was able to pay that off when he signed his first sponsorship deals and won his first prize money.
He said he would not have become the player he did ""without the sacrifices of mom and dad, who instilled in me this work ethic to fight for what I believe in, to chase after my dreams"".
In 1997 he became the first black player to win a major with his 12-shot victory at the Masters and between 1999-2002 he won a remarkable seven out of 11, including a run of four across two years, dubbed the 'Tiger Slam'.
His ""darkest times"" included the breakdown of his marriage to Elin Nordegren after he admitted in December 2009 to having had numerous affairs.
He also had several operations on knee and back injuries, returning to end a five-year drought by winning the 2018 Tour Championship.
Sensationally, he then won his first major in 11 years, collecting his fifth Green Jacket at the 2019 Masters.
He hugged Sam and his son Charlie after that victory at Augusta National, just as he had done with his parents 22 years earlier.
""This is why you deserve this, because you're a fighter,"" Sam had said in her earlier speech.
She called his car crash one of his ""ultimate lows"" and one of the scariest moments of their family's life. 
""Now you are here standing on your own two feet,"" adding ""through thick and thin"" their family will always be a team.
The ceremony, which took place at the PGA Tour's new headquarters in Florida on the eve of its flagship Players Championship, also saw three other people inducted into the Hall of Fame to take the total number to 164.
Former PGA Tour commissioner Tim Finchem, four-time women's major winner Susie Maxwell Berning and the late golf course developer Marion Hollins, who founded Cypress Hill in California, were also recognised for their golfing achievements.

237,237,Women share stories of running in public and their safety concerns,"Thu, 10 Mar 2022 06:16:00 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/athletics/60670632,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/athletics/60670632?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,Is it too dark? Should I wear something different? BBC Sport looks at the reality of being a woman out running and what is done to make it safer.,"Women share stories of running in public and their safety concerns
One in five women worry about the risk or threat of sexual harassment while exercising, according to Sport England's This Girl Can research
Have you ever checked the clock and realised it was too dark go for a run? Have you ever changed your clothes because they may be 'too revealing' to avoid yet another car beeping at you? Have you ever carried a credit card in your leggings pocket 'just in case'?
It is likely that if you're a woman who has ever exercised outside, you would answer 'yes' to all of these questions. 
In January this year, Ashling Murphy put on her trainers, left her house and never returned.
The 23-year-old teacher was killed while out exercising at 4pm, running along the banks of the Grand Canal outside Tullamore, Ireland. Jozef Puska, 31, has been charged with her murder and is awaiting trial. 
Murphy's death led to outpourings of grief and support, especially on social media, with #shewasonarun trending across posts and stories, as people tried to make sense of yet another female life being taken too soon.
She was doing something she enjoyed. She was doing something she should feel safe to do. She was just running. 
Most women know the mental checklist you complete before training outside: you contemplate the time of day you leave the house, you pick the most populated or well-lit roads and paths and dress appropriately - because you're trying to minimise the likelihood of sparking unwanted and unwarranted attention.
Amy Hughes, the first women to run 53 marathons in 53 days, lives in Cheshire and knows the checklist well: ""I've always been wary of what time I go out [for a run]. 
""In the day I'm not really bothered at all, but you do have to think about it if it's dark,"" she told BBC Sport.
""You've also got to think about what you're wearing and you shouldn't have to think about what you put on to go for a run, but it's just in case someone says or does something."" 
Murphy's death left many women questioning how safe they are training and exercising on the streets alone.
In November 2021, Sport England's This Girl Can research found:
• One in five women (22%) worry about the risk or threat of sexual harassment in relation to doing physical activity and exercise, including 38% of those aged 16-20 and 35% aged 21-30
• 28% worry about personal safety exercising outside in the dark 
Hughes recalled one experience she had while running.
""There was a traffic jam and these guys were in the car and they were just shouting disgusting things at me as I ran past,"" she said. 
28% of women worry about personal safety exercising outside in the dark, according to Sport England research
Charlotte, a runner training for the Manchester marathon was even photographed by a man while she was running in broad daylight.
""I was running in a wooded area in the summer and there was no-one else around me,"" she said. ""As I ran past him, he lifted his phone and photographed me. He didn't say anything, he just took a photo of me.
""It made me feel so uncomfortable and upset and I ran home as fast as I could. I remember questioning everyone who I ran past on my way home, wondering if I had enough energy left to sprint away if I needed to.
""Once I got home I was playing it over and over in my head. He didn't touch me or say anything but the idea that there was a picture of me on that man's phone without my consent made me feel sick.""
Charlotte did report it to the police after encouragement from her friends.
""The sad thing is, I now have the same worries on every single run,"" she said. ""I know I'm a smart, confident and capable runner, yet in the space of a few seconds none of that mattered. In that man's mind I wasn't worthy of his respect, I was just a woman exercising that he wanted to look at.""
Emma, a runner in London, says constant harassment has changed how she exercises.
""Almost every time I run near a road I have men rolling down their windows, shouting sexual abuse. I only run near a road because I'm nervous to go to the park. I've completely stopped running alone because nowhere feels safe,"" she said.
This type of harassment or intimidation does not just affect people enjoying their daily exercise - professional athletes have also spoken out about how it is affecting them while training.
British triathlete and Olympic gold medallist Georgia Taylor-Brown tweeted in December: ""I left my house for a run a few days ago and as I ran past three workmen, they whistled at me. Did they really need to make me feel uncomfortable while I'm just trying to do my job?"" 
And Welsh 400m runner Rhiannon Linington-Payne questioned what governing bodies were doing to help women train safely outdoors when indoor venues were closed during the winter 2021 Covid lockdown. 
As a result, Welsh governing bodies made an effort to work with Welsh police to tackle intimidating behaviour. But a report by UN Women last year found that 95% of sexual harassment is going unreported in the UK, so is enough being done?
Mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, believes it is down to men and boys to question and change their behaviour towards women in public.
In his video campaign 'Is This OK?' that was released in December 2021, the video shows a young woman being approached, filmed, shouted at and intimidated while running and he says it is on men to rectify this issue not women.
Burnham said: ""Blokes have got to look themselves in the mirror. It's embarrassing to behave in that way, why? It's just not right. It's not respectful. It's not acceptable what women have to face day to day. 
""Sometimes there's too much tolerance of the macho, laddish banter but there are boundaries and actually we shouldn't let that go unchallenged.
""If you have mates that do that regularly, if you have mates that spike drinks, or do worse in pubs and clubs you shouldn't just distance yourself from them, you should report them. And just have a different approach to this whole issue.
""The campaign is really important on so many levels. But as I say, it's about men, lads and boys. This one's on us. We've got to own it. We've got to sort it out. It's time for change.""

238,238,Mazepin & father added to list of wealthy Russians sanctioned by EU,"Wed, 09 Mar 2022 18:01:15 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/formula1/60678476,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/formula1/60678476?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,Ex-Haas driver Nikita Mazepin and his father Dmitry are added to a list of Russians sanctioned over the invasion of Ukraine.,"Formula 1: Russian driver Nikita Mazepin and father Dmitry sanctioned by EU
Mazepin and team-mate Mick Schumacher failed to register a point in the entire 2021 season
Ex-Haas driver Nikita Mazepin and his father Dmitry have been added to a list of Russians sanctioned over the invasion of Ukraine.
On Wednesday the European Union declared chemicals billionaire Dmitry Mazepin ""a member of the closest circle of [President] Vladimir Putin"".
An EU document accused Mazepin Sr of ""supporting or implementing actions which undermine or threaten"" Ukraine.
His business was providing ""substantial revenue"" to the Russian government.
Nikita Mazepin said on Wednesday that he did not believe his sacking by the US-based team at the weekend was ""fair"", adding that he ""didn't deserve it"".
Denmark's Magnussen replaces Mazepin at Haas
But the EU said he was ""a natural person associated with a leading businessperson [his father]  involved in economic sectors providing a substantial source of revenue to the government of the Russian Federation, which is responsible for the annexation of Crimea and the destabilisation of Ukraine"".
Mazepin owed his seat to sponsorship funding from the Russian chemicals business Uralkali, which is part-owned by his father through his company Uralchem.
The EU is attempting to close loopholes in its sanctions against allies of Putin.
Those named on the list will be subject to an assets freeze and visa-ban blacklist.
Mazepin Sr's presence at a meeting with Putin at the Kremlin on 24 February was cited as a specific example of his links to the war.
The EU statement said Mazepin, along with 36 other businesspeople, ""met with President Vladimir Putin and other members of the Russian government to discuss the impact of the course of action in the wake of Western sanctions"". 
It added: ""The fact that he was invited to attend this meeting shows that he is a member of the closest circle of Vladimir Putin and that he is supporting or implementing actions or policies which undermine or threaten the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine, as well as stability and security in Ukraine.""
The move means Nikita Mazepin would not have been able to take part in a significant number of races for Haas this year, even if the team had not terminated his contract.
Nikita Mazepin claimed at a news conference on Wednesday that there was ""no legal reason that could enable the team to terminate my contract"".
He said he had committed to race as a neutral, as permitted by F1's governing body the FIA, but refused to say whether he approved or disapproved of Putin's decision to invade Ukraine.
He also did not answer questions about whether he would have signed a document the FIA requires of all Russian and Belarussian drivers that commits them to comply with decisions made by the FIA on 1 March, when the organisation announced it ""condemned"" the invasion.
Mazepin said the question was irrelevant because he did not have a contract to race.
Asked whether it was possible for him to be perceived as a neutral athlete in the context of his father's links to the Kremlin, Mazepin reiterated that the FIA had ""ruled that drivers can compete if they are neutral. This I am ready to agree with. And I was ready to consider myself neutral to compete"".
He added: ""Formula 1 is not a closed chapter for me. I will be ready to race in case there is an opportunity to return. I wish all the best to the drivers who will replace me. They have nothing to do with the existing situation.""

239,239,Man City comfortably into Champions League last eight with draw,"Wed, 09 Mar 2022 23:26:53 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/60666631,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/60666631?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,"Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola says he has learned to ""enjoy the moment"" as his side cruise into the quarter-finals of the Champions League with a 0-0 draw against Sporting Lisbon.","Man City 0-0 Sporting Lisbon (5-0 agg): Pep Guardiola's side comfortably into last eight with draw
Raheem Sterling had a golden chance to score his 25th Champions League goal before half-time, but saw his shot saved by Antonio Adan
Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola said he has learned to ""enjoy the moment"" after his side cruised into the quarter-finals of the Champions League despite being held at home by Sporting Lisbon. 
It is the fifth successive season City have reached the quarter-finals, while Guardiola has managed a team to this stage for a record-equalling 12th time.
""I'm a guy who learns at the time to enjoy the moment. When I qualify for the quarter-finals, I enjoy it; when I qualify for the last 16, I know how difficult it is,"" said Guardiola, who led Barcelona to two Champions League titles as their manager.
""When you go through, every opponent is difficult. Now it is time to congratulate everyone, focus on the Premier League and see the draw.""
City's stunning 5-0 win in last month's first leg in Lisbon had already effectively settled this tie, and it was clear from the outset that the Portuguese side did not entertain any hope of an unlikely comeback.
Sporting packed their defence, perhaps wary of suffering another damaging defeat, leaving Guardiola's side in total control of possession but struggling to carve out meaningful chances.
Raheem Sterling wasted City's best opportunity before the break when he ran on to Phil Foden's pass and tried to dink the ball over Antonio Adan but did not get enough height on his shot.
Gabriel Jesus did find the net for the home side at the start of the second half but a VAR review ruled he was offside from Riyad Mahrez's pass and the goal was disallowed.
Despite being unable to make the breakthrough, City remained completely comfortable and Guardiola was relaxed enough to bring on third-choice keeper Scott Carson for Ederson with 20 minutes remaining.
The 36-year-old, making his first appearance of the season, was quickly called into action to deny Paulinho from close range, bringing chants of 'England's number one' from the delighted City fans.
City will find out their quarter-final opponents on 18 March and Guardiola said it was a ""good sign"" that expectations have risen for the club. 
""The last decade, step by step, the club grew and for many years we were there in the Champions League and qualifying for the last 16,"" he added. 
""Now, again, we're in the quarter-finals and among the best eight teams in Europe.""

It's an honour to be among the last eight teams in Europe - Guardiola
This was the first time since the end of October that City had failed to score at home but, while this performance lacked the sparkle of their win in Lisbon, they never loosened their grip on the tie.
Sporting did manage some efforts at goal before the end but in the early stages they barely got a kick, and seemed content to try to keep City quiet.
Until Sterling ran clear before half-time, there had been precious little goalmouth action at either end but the home fans, still chanting noisily about Sunday's thumping derby win over Manchester United, did not seem to care too much.
City's lack of fit or available defenders had been a cause for concern for Guardiola before kick-off but Sporting's lack of ambition meant he had little to worry about on the night, and teenage defender Conrad Egan-Riley acquitted himself well on his debut at this level.
So too did veteran midfielder Fernandinho, who was making his 100th Champions League appearance, and seemed to relish his recall to the starting line-up.
There are much tougher tests to come for City this season, starting with their trip to Crystal Palace in the Premier League on Monday, but they made effortless progress here.

241,241,On the front line of the battle for Kharkiv,"Thu, 10 Mar 2022 17:04:13 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-60693166,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-60693166?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,Quentin Sommerville and cameraman Darren Conway are with Ukrainian forces fighting to stop the Russian advance on the country's second city.,"Ukraine war: On the front line of the battle for Kharkiv
Lieutenant Yevgen Gromadsky
In the early days of the invasion, Kharkiv in eastern Ukraine fought back a Russian armoured column. Since then, it has suffered nightly Russian airstrikes and shelling, with dozens of civilians killed and hundreds injured. The BBC's Quentin Sommerville and cameraman Darren Conway have spent the week with the Ukrainian forces as they fight to stop a further Russian advance. 
This report contains material some viewers will find disturbing
The first casualty of war is time. Ask the young soldier at the front when the attack happened, or the old lady in the hospital bed when her home was shelled, and they look at you confused. Was it 24 hours ago, or 48? The days have become one, they tell you.
In Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, time is elastic. It's close to the border with Russia and the nightly shelling from Russian artillery and warplanes gives no rest. The past two weeks have seemed like an eternity, yet peace can be remembered as if it were yesterday.
In a frozen landscape on the city's north-eastern edge, 21-year-old Lieutenant Yevgen Gromadsky stands with hands outstretched. There are trenches dug in nearby.  ""Outgoing,"" he says, lifting his right hand to accompany the thump of fire from his positions. ""Incoming,"" he says, and his left hand ticks up. With a crump, Russian shells are fired from their positions 900m away across snow-covered fields. 
The shelling continues like clockwork at the edge of this bombed-out village - ""Incoming, outgoing, incoming, outgoing,"" Lt Gromadsky flicks his hands with each report.  
We met only this afternoon, but already I know that just last week, his father Oleg was killed defending the city, and Lt Gromadsky is the seventh generation of military in his family. He plans for an eighth, in a free Ukraine.
He describes the fight so far, ""Sabotage groups are probing our lines out, we have direct tank battles. They shoot with mortar shells at first, and then tanks fire at our positions.""
White flag tactic 
We move along the front lines from position to position. Inside his armoured vehicle, a Russian army hat - a trophy from their first capture - hanging from the ceiling, he continues, ""We are shooting back with anti-tank guided missiles and also the usual small arms. They dismount, they scatter, there's always a lot of people.""
Inside the truck there are Mexican Day of the Dead air fresheners. Grinning skulls hanging from every corner as we bounce along rutted dirt road. On the floor, rocket-propelled grenade launchers roll around.
From the front passenger seat Lt Gromadsky says, ""Sometimes they use this tactic - first, they raise a white flag above their equipment, then come closer to our positions. When we come up and kind of take them as prisoners of war, they start to open fire on our troops.""
The position was attacked on Monday (or was it the day before, he wonders), two Russian tanks and an armoured vehicle. ""Don't worry, we are well defended,"" he says as he gestures to a pile of American-made Javelin guided anti-tank missiles. ""Lockheed Martin, Texas,"" is written on their casing. Nearby, is a pile of British next-generation light anti-tank weapon (NLAW) missiles. ""Eliminates even the most advanced tanks,"" its manufacturer Saab promises on its website.
It is bitterly cold and two puppies are playing around Lt Gromadsky's feet. His shoes are a pair of white Puma trainers - ""You need to be fast out here,"" he says.
The Ukrainians are improvising in this war. Their government has been criticised for being ill-prepared, and now there is a rush to bring men forward to the front. The regular army is being merged with civilian defence forces. At a marshalling point on the city's eastern edge, I watch as buses arrive with hundreds of freshly equipped soldiers. ""Where's my body armour?"" asks one. ""You'll get it at the front,"" yells an officer, and moments later they are gone.

Some will be joining Lt Gromadsky's unit and working alongside a medic who goes by the name of Reaper. ""You've heard of the grim reaper, right?"" he asks. He's also in command of this defence line at the edge of a village. Many of the homes there have been destroyed or damaged by Russian shelling.
How are the Russians fighting, I ask. ""They fight like stupid animals,"" says Reaper. ""They fight like it's 1941 - they have no manoeuvrability, they just come to the front and that's all. They have a lot of people, a lot of tanks, a lot of vehicles, but we are fighting for our land, and we are protecting our families. it doesn't matter how they fight because we fight like lions and they won't win.""
Back in the rear, the field kitchen is in a coffee shop. The army cook is reassuringly large with a knitted hat atop his head. He offers bowls of steaming hot borscht - ""Have sour cream with it,"" he insists. There are piles of cakes and biscuits, made by local factories for the troops.
I sit beside a 30-year-old battalion commander, Sergey. ""We see the enemy, we kill the enemy, there's no conversation, that's it,"" he says. He wants to know where I'm from. I tell him and he asks if it's true that British volunteers have come to fight for Ukraine. ""What aircraft have you given us,"" he says as he finishes his borscht.
Battalion commander Sergey
But across the east and south of Ukraine, Russia has been advancing. The Russian army has met more determined resistance than it expected, but cities continue to fall. And for all their front-line courage, there is a recognition that their abilities on the ground will not be enough. Soldier after soldier says they need air defence, a no-fly zone.
I get inside another armoured vehicle, which two weeks ago was doing cash pickups at the city's banks. It, too, has now been put into the war effort. As we drive through the city, with its wide boulevards, and fine buildings, we reach a Soviet-Era apartment complex. And there I meet Eugene, a great Viking of a man, heavily tattooed with an orange beard.
Eugene is part of a reconnaissance team
""If Kharkiv falls, then all of Ukraine falls,"" Eugene, 36,  tells me. He's a part of a reconnaissance team working near apartment blocks. Some of the flats have taken direct hits and in the car park, a car lies ripped apart from another grad missile strike.
What there isn't here in Kharkiv, is any surprise at the Russian attack. ""Since 2014 we knew they would come, maybe in a year, 10 years, or 1,000 years, but we knew they would come"".
At 04:55 on 24 February, Eugene received a call from a friend saying the attack was about to begin. ""Then I heard the rockets attack our city,"" he says. Like everyone else he hasn't been home since.
Viewers in the UK can watch an extended report from Kharkiv on BBC iPlayer
Leaving the front to return to the centre of the city is almost like entering another world. The relentless Russian shelling has meant that most of the 1.5m population has fled. Few neighbourhoods have escaped some kind of damage. Early in the mornings, queues can still be seen at pharmacies, banks, supermarkets and petrol stations, as those who stayed behind stock up on supplies. A huge logistical and humanitarian effort is going on behind the scenes to keep Kharkiv running.
Before curfew I make my way to the city's Hospital Number 4 to meet Dr Alexander Dukhovskyi, head of paediatrics. Underneath his hospital whites, he's wearing a Miami Beach 2015 T-shirt, with the American flag. He hasn't gone home in weeks.

He laughs when I say that Russia says it isn't targeting civilians. Then, silently, he takes me down corridor after corridor of victims of Russian attacks. They are in the hallways because Russian shells have landed nearby, so the patients aren't safe in the wards with large windows. Most here were injured while at home.
The children's intensive care unit is on the ground floor. Its narrow windows catch the brilliant light from the snow outside and glint over the golden icons of saints above the nurses' station.
Dmitry in intensive care
In a bed nearby is eight-year-old Dmitry. His toes poke out from under the blanket and a hand, bruised and bloodied peeks out too. His face is scraped and scarred with hundreds of marks, his right eye is not quite closed. A few days ago, the doctors removed a bullet from under his skull and vertebrae.
It is hoped he'll make a full recovery, but for the moment he's in a sorry state, with tubes taking out fluids from his small body in plastic bottles hanging beneath his bed. The thin blanket with tiny roses on it, rises and falls with his mechanical breathing.

Vladimir Putin said he wanted to demilitarise Ukraine, instead he's creating a no-man's land. At night the city is in near total blackout. A steady beat of Russian strikes fall through the night.
Kharkiv was once Ukraine's capital - it has the parks, cathedrals, museums and theatres you would expect, as well as the Antonov aircraft factory and tank and turbine manufacturers.
All of the city is now a front line.
And this, too, should come as no surprise. The Russian war-playbook has been perfected in Syria over the past 10 years. Surround, besiege, and terrorise the population. In Ukraine, as in Syria, the population is being bussed out of their home cities as Russian forces continue their advance.
But still Ukraine resists.
I meet an intelligence team, who drive with anti-tank missiles ready to use in the back of their vehicles. Again, I head to the city's edge, and pass through the front lines into a wasteland. Two petrol stations just outside the city that have been destroyed by shelling and gunfire.
Lying in the snow, are a dozen or so frozen Russian corpses. The men lie like wax figures, some with hands reaching out, their matted beards frozen stiff in the cold.
The guts of one are spilled across the forecourt. There are blood-red footprints around his corpse. Their weapons have been taken, and I ask Uta, one of the officers, what will happen to the bodies.
""What do you think will happen, we will leave them for the dogs,"" he says with a shrug.
And at this miserable spot on Kharkiv's edge, unremarkable for its ordinariness two weeks ago, surrounded by frozen corpses, it's as if time is standing still.

242,242,Ukraine war: Large Russian convoy redeploys near Kyiv - satellite images,"Fri, 11 Mar 2022 05:38:49 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-60702464,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-60702464?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,"The convoy has now largely dispersed, with artillery set up in firing positions, a US company says.","Ukraine war: Large Russian convoy redeploys near Kyiv - satellite images
Satellite images taken by a US firm of a large Russian military convoy near Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, show it has ""largely dispersed and redeployed"".
The convoy was last seen near Antonov Airport, north-west of Kyiv, and its movement could signal a renewed push towards the city.
The firm that took the photos, Maxar Technologies, said parts of the convoy were in positions in surrounding towns.
Other parts are further north, with artillery now in firing positions.
The apparent redeployment came as Russian forces in Ukraine began attacking new targets in different areas of the country:
An airfield and jet engine factory were targeted in Lutsk, in the north-west
Explosions also hit airfields at Ivano-Frankivsk, in the south-west, according to Russian defence officials
In Dnipro, a major stronghold in central eastern Ukraine, one person was reported dead in air strikes  
Safe haven no more
Sarah Rainsford, Eastern Europe correspondent, Dnipro
The air raid sirens went off at 04:30 and wailed for more than three hours. We now know the danger was real. 
Officials here say there were three air strikes, hitting a small shoe factory, an apartment block and a kindergarten. 
This city is full of heavy industry, including a rocket factory. There is a metalworks nearby the site that was hit, but no obvious military target. 
Dnipro has been bracing for this since the war began. All the bridges and main roads here are heavily guarded. Residents have got used to scrambling to underground shelters when the sirens sound. 
Even so, the city has been something of a safe haven, for people fleeing cities under sustained Russian attack. In the past few days, residents here had begun leaving: we saw giant queues for evacuation trains and the roads west out of town have been heavily congested. Now the city has been directly hit, I suspect more will be thinking of getting out. 
""Ukrainian big cities are again subjected to devastating blows,"" said Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhaylo Podolyak.
He added that the shelling in Lutsk had shut down two central heating compounds.
""Russia's destructive war against civilians and major cities continues,"" he said.
Russian state media reported that the Ukrainian city of Volnovakha had been captured by Russian-backed separatist forces.  
There is no independent confirmation of the capture of the city, which is a northern gateway to the besieged port city of Mariupol.

President Volodymyr Zelensky has rejected Russian claims that chemical weapons or weapons of mass destruction were developed in Ukraine. In a video address, he also warned that Russia would get ""the most severe sanctions response"" if it were to use such weapons against Ukraine.
The US said earlier that Russia's claims of Ukraine hosting US-backed chemical weapons facilities was a ""false flag"", intended to justify Russia's possible use of such weapons.
Russia has requested an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council on Friday to discuss the alleged manufacture of biological weapons in Ukraine.
Convoy redeploys around Kyiv
Russian forces moved three miles (5km) closer to Kyiv in the past 24 hours, a senior US defence official said on Thursday.
That meant Russian troops advancing from the north-west were now just nine miles from the city centre, the official - who spoke on condition of anonymity - told reporters.
Russian forces were also trying to close in on the city from the north-east, and were now about 25 miles (40km) away, the official said.
The northern city of Chernihiv was now ""isolated"" the official added. 
Why has Russia's 64km convoy stopped moving?
The convoy was earlier seen stalled not far from the capital, where US officials said it was targeted by Ukrainian troops with anti-tank missiles. It is not clear how many of the vehicles currently seen on the move may have been an initial part of that first group.
Fierce battles have been raging in recent days in Irpin and Bucha, satellite towns just a few kilometres north-west of Kyiv. Thousands of civilians have been forced to flee their homes.
On Thursday, footage emerged apparently showing a Russian military column being hit by Ukrainian forces near the city of Brovary, just outside the capital.
Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko says that half the population of the city of about three million has already fled, adding that Kyiv ""has been transformed into a fortress"". 
""Every street, every building, every checkpoint has been fortified,"" the mayor said.
Tens of thousands of civilians have formed Territorial Defence units to help the Ukrainian armed forces defend the capital.

Watch: Lena and Raisa Kamolikova face a lengthy process to apply for a UK visa in Poland
Boris Johnson has defended the UK's response to the refugee crisis and said an upcoming scheme will allow Britons to take Ukrainians into their homes.
The PM told Sky News the UK would be ""generous"" to those fleeing Ukraine, and that details of a second visa scheme would be announced on Monday.
Defending the current visa rules, Mr Johnson said: ""People want us to be generous but also careful.""
The UK has been criticised for only taking in about 1,000 refugees so far.
Unlike the European Union - which is allowing Ukrainians three-year residency without a visa - the UK has retained controls on entry, saying they are essential for security.
But the government has come under mounting pressure, including from Conservative MPs, to do more to take in refugees fleeing Ukraine. 
A scheme allowing individuals and businesses to sponsor a refugee's visa to the UK was originally promised on 1 March, along with the other main route for Ukrainians to get to the UK, which launched last week and allows refugees to join relatives already settled in Britain.
As Russia targets more cities for air strikes and shelling, the United Nations said more than 2.5 million people have now fled Ukraine. More than 1.5 million refugees crossed into Poland, but about 40% of them are thought to have subsequently left for other countries.
Meanwhile, the UK has imposed sanctions on 386 more members of Russia's parliament who voted to recognise the independence of breakaway Ukrainian regions Luhansk and Donetsk, which the Foreign Office said was used as a ""pretext"" for the invasion of Ukraine.
A total of 400 members of the Duma, the lower house of Russia's parliament, are now subject to sanctions - including asset freezes, a ban on entering the country and a ban on doing business in the UK.

How does the UK's visa scheme for Ukrainians work?
Speaking on Sky News' Beth Rigby Interviews programme, Mr Johnson said ""historically and by nature"", the British people are ""very generous, open and welcoming"". 
Defending the need to check biometric data, such as fingerprints, he said: ""People want us to be generous but also careful,"" adding security measures were ""light touch"" and ""sensible given the attitudes of the Putin regime towards the UK"".
Mr Johnson said this would also be the ""best thing for refugees, because they want a scheme that is safe, that is welcoming and that works"".
Challenged on why the checks would be needed for children, who are estimated to make up around half of the two million refugees fleeing Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the prime minister said these requirements did not apply to younger people.
But pressed on why just 1,000 family visas had been issued so far, Mr Johnson said the number would ""rise very sharply"".
He added that on Monday, the Levelling Up, Housing and Communities Secretary Michael Gove would announce details of the second visa scheme, which he said would mean that ""if people want to welcome [them] into their own homes, they can do so"".
However, the British Red Cross and Ukraine's UK ambassador have been among those urging the government to drop requirements for visas altogether during the war so Ukrainian refugees can travel to the UK more easily.
On Thursday Home Secretary Priti Patel announced that, from Tuesday, Ukrainian refugees with valid passports will be able to apply for visas online without submitting biometric information until they reach the UK.
The change - which Ms Patel said had the approval of the security services - would only affect people applying under the family scheme.
French President Emmanuel Macron said he saw a ""glimmer of pragmatism"" in the move but added that ""we'll see in coming days whether it's enough or needs to go further"".
Refugee plans begin to take shape
The government is keen to avoid some of the problems of the scheme designed to help Afghans fleeing after the Taliban took back power, with thousands of people still stuck in hotels without temporary accommodation.  
The Home Office will still administer the provision of visas, with the levelling up department taking responsibility for what happens once the refugees are here. 
It's not impossible that the offer, expected to be detailed on Monday, could result in many thousands of Ukrainians coming here. 
With more than two million people on the move as a result of the war, the need is plain. 
Like the family visa scheme, which has already been extended under political pressure, the sponsorship route is not expected to have a limit. 
How many Ukrainians end up in the UK may rest therefore, in part, on the willingness of the British people to open their homes. 
Read more of Laura's analysis here.
Ministers and officials met on Thursday afternoon to discuss the sponsorship plan, in which refugee groups are expected to be involved in finding suitable host individuals or organisations - such as families or church groups.
It is anticipated that those offering accommodation will be expected to commit to a minimum of six months. 
Ukrainians entering through this new route are expected to be allowed to stay for a year initially and will be entitled to work, claim benefits and access public services.
Ahead of the scheme's launch, Krish Kandiah, a government adviser on the care system, said 2,000 people and organisations had signed up to help Ukrainian refugees settle in the UK through his Sanctuary Foundation.
He told BBC Breakfast that he understood people would be able to offer homes to Ukrainians they already knew personally or they could be matched by the government with refugees.
Pop-up visa application centre opening
From Phil Mackie in Arras, France
The Préfecture du Pas-de-Calais has announced where the ""pop-up"" visa processing centre for Ukrainian refugees will be. 
There had been reports it would be in Lille, but it's in Arras, in France, which is one hour from Calais, two from Brussels and three from Paris. 
The UK government had been promising it would open for several few days now. French authorities say it is finally expected to start operating on Friday. 
Many of the hundreds of Ukrainians who are in northern France have spent the past week travelling to the French and Belgian capitals to submit biometric information and documentation. 
Many have already been processed and it's thought most will be by next Tuesday, when the process becomes simpler and will move online.
The Foreign Office also confirmed, external on Thursday that all Ukrainian staff working for the British embassy and British Council in Ukraine plus their dependents are able to come to the UK.
However, the speed of the UK's response to taking in Ukrainian refugees has been criticised, with Labour's shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper calling it a ""total disgrace"".

244,244,Ukraine conflict: Growing numbers of firms pull back from Russia,"Fri, 11 Mar 2022 00:52:35 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-60571133,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-60571133?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,Reputational risk and practical difficulties are making it harder to do business in the country.,"Which companies are pulling out of Russia?
Thirty years ago when communism collapsed in the Soviet Union, Western firms stepped up their presence in Russia. 
The arrival of big Western companies symbolised the start of a new era with Russians becoming eager consumers of brands ranging from fast-food chain McDonalds to Levi jeans and luxury goods. 
Now, in the wake of President Putin's invasion of Ukraine, a growing number of firms have suspended activities in Russia.
So which firms, in which sectors, are exiting and why have others held back? 
Fast food and drinks giants
McDonald's, Coca-Cola, Starbucks and Heineken are the latest companies to announce they are halting business in Russia after mounting pressure to act.
McDonald's said it was temporarily closing its roughly 850 restaurants in Russia, while Starbucks also said its 100 coffee shops would shut.
The firms were initially remained tight lipped over the conflict, but took action because shareholders ""wouldn't stand"" for the continued generation of profits from Russia, says Anna MacDonald, a fund manager at Amati Global Investors.
""It was affecting their share prices and the feeling was that it was just utterly inappropriate to continue to do so,"" she told the BBC.
Pepsi, which has a much larger presence in Russia than rival Coca-Cola, said it was halting the production and sale of Pepsi and other global brands in Russia, but the company, which employs 20,000 people there, said it would continue to offer other products.
Food companies Nestle, Mondelez, Procter & Gamble and Unilever have halted investment in Russia, but said they would continue providing essentials.
British American Tobacco has announced it plans to sell its business in Russia due to it being ""no longer sustainable in the current environment"".
Retail
The world's biggest cosmetics firm L'Oreal and rival Estee Lauder are both closing shops , external and ceasing online sales. Estee Lauder, whose brands include Michael Kors, DKNY, Clinique and Bobbi Brown, has had a presence in the country for about 30 years and Russia was where it had some of its strongest sales.
In fact, Russia was the fifth largest European retail market globally last year, valued at £337.2bn. So some brands may not want to burn their bridges, if there's a chance of returning at a later date.
That is why many firms, including other luxury retailers like Burberry and Chanel, simply say they are ""suspending"" sales and temporarily shutting stores rather than withdrawing altogether, says Chris Weafer, chief executive of consulting firm Macro-advisory Limited. 
With sanctions limiting forms of payment and huge uncertainty over future prices and consumer appetite, the business climate is ""extremely challenging"" he adds, making the decision to hit pause easier. 
The world's biggest fashion retailers H&M and Zara-owner Inditex, which has 502 stores in the country, for example have already suspended sales in Russia, citing ""tragic developments"" in Ukraine. Other brands like Nike have simply said they can't currently guarantee delivery of goods to customers in Russia.
More brands are likely to follow suit, according to Maureen Hinton of retail consultancy GlobalData. Boohoo, Swedish furniture giant Ikea and Japanese clothing retailer Uniqlo which initially kept its 49 Russian stores open, saying clothes were a ""necessity of life"", are some of the other names to have now cut ties. 
Even Levi's, the jeans brand that became a symbol of post-Soviet business in Russia, has closed its shops. The all-American jeans firm said about, external 4% of its total net sales came from Eastern Europe and Russia last year, but ""any business considerations are clearly secondary to the human suffering experienced by so many"".
Technology
Samsung, the leading supplier of smartphones in Russia, has said it will suspend shipments to the country but has not said whether its shops will close.
Japan's Sony and Nintendo suspended deliveries of gaming consoles, and Sony suspended the launch of racing game ""Gran Turismo 7"".
Apple has also halted all of its product sales in Russia, and limited other services such as Apple Pay and Apple Maps. Its shops have closed too.
All shops under the Re:store in Moscow have been shut as Apple halts all product sales in Russia
For a firm like Apple selling imported items, that's a relatively straightforward decision to take, suggests Macro-advisory's Chris Weafer. 
""Companies do not want to be associated with the Russian regime and what's happening in Ukraine,"" he says. Their Russian business may be profitable, but ""the rest of the world is more important"" when it comes to reputational risk.
Some tech companies, flooded by misinformation, are also restricting Kremlin-linked media outlets posting on their platforms. Facebook was blocked in Russia after it said it had refused to stop fact-checking and labelling content from state-owned news organisations. 
Meanwhile, TikTok has blocked all non-Russian content in Russia and suspended live streaming, although it is allowing historical content uploaded by domestic accounts to stay online, including videos by state-backed media services.
Consultancy firms
Large consultancy and law firms were some of the first to set up a presence in Russia after the collapse of the Soviet Union but they mostly operate out of the spotlight. 
All of the Big Four accounting groups - Deloitte, KPMG, EY and PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) - have said they will no longer have a member firm in Russia because of the invasion. Top-tier law firm Freshfields says it will no longer work with any clients linked to the Russian state either.
Others say they are reviewing their client base and Russian links. 
What sanctions are being imposed on Russia?
How badly will Russia be hit by new sanctions?
A senior executive for consultancy firm McKinsey, for example, wrote online that the company would ""no longer serve"" any government or state-owned entities in Russia. According to McKinsey's website, it serves 21 of the 30 biggest Russian companies.
Oil and gas
When the conflict in Ukraine broke out, energy firms came under immediate pressure. And that is set to intensify now the UK, US and UK have announced bans or curbs on Russian oil and gas.
BP owns a large stake in Russian energy giant Rosneft, but within days of the war starting it had announced the operation would be hived off. 
That was closely followed by pledges from Shell, ExxonMobil and Equinor to cut their Russian investments following pressure from shareholders, as well as from governments and the public.

Firms want to be seen to be doing the ""right thing"", says Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell.
Meanwhile, Total Energies, another big player in Russia, has said it won't fund new projects in the country, but unlike its peers does not plan to sell existing investments.
It is still far from clear what will happen to those investments - whether they can eventually be sold, recouping some of their value, or if they will simply be written off at great cost.
Entertainment
Film fans in Russia wanting to go and see Warner Bros' new blockbuster The Batman won't be able to after the company suspended new film releases in the country.
The US movie-maker was joined by Disney and Sony, with premieres of animation Turning Red and Marvel adaptation Morbius also being withdrawn. Disney has also paused its TV channels.
Netflix, a fairly new entrant in Russia, has suspended its service in the country and put all ""future projects"" on pause.
Pixar's new animated film Turning Red won't be released in Russia
All companies said their decisions were based on the ""humanitarian crisis"" in Ukraine, rather than as a result of sanctions that have been imposed.
All three of the world's major record labels - Sony, Warner and Universal - have closed their offices in Russia, and Spotify has announced it is cancelling its subscription service, although the free, ad-funded version will still work.
Finance
Payment giants Visa, Mastercard, American Express and PayPal are pulling out of the Russian market in protest.
Russian banks have, however, already downplayed the impact of the announcements on their clients. 
Sberbank, for example, said that Visa and Mastercard-branded cards would continue to work on Russian territory because all payments in Russia are made through a national system.  
However, domestically issued cards won't work abroad, and foreign-issued ones won't work inside the country.
US investment bank Goldman Sachs was the first Wall Street bank to say it was winding down its Russian business. The bank, soon followed by JPMorgan, said it was doing so in compliance with regulatory and licensing requirements. 
German lender Deutsche Bank, which had faced criticism for defending plans not to withdraw, has also said it was taking steps to exit, pledging ""there won't be any new business in Russia"".
Cars
Jaguar Land Rover, General Motors, Aston Martin and Rolls-Royce are among the car-makers that have halted deliveries of vehicles to Russia due to the conflict, while construction equipment manufacturer JCB has paused all operations.
Jaguar Land Rover said sales were paused due to ""trading challenges""
Cars are the biggest UK export to Russia, but still only 1% of UK cars went to Russia last year. 
So any decision to stop exporting won't be particularly costly, and will have been made easier by nagging concerns over whether or not payments will arrive, says investment analyst Russ Mould.
Transporting cars to Russia could prove difficult anyway, with the world's two largest cargo shipping companies, MSC and Maersk, suspending routes to and from Russia, except for food, medical and humanitarian supply deliveries.
Which firms remain?
While the flood of announcements from companies stepping back goes on, there are calls for more to join them.
Attention has turned to big food firms like Burger King who have condemned Russia's actions and have pledged support for Ukraine, but are yet to pull out.
Some firms will also find it much harder to extricate themselves, even if pressure mounts in the coming days and weeks.
In retaliation against sanctions introduced by Western countries, Moscow has banned the sale of Russian assets. So firms that, in recent years, have been encouraged to establish a presence in Russia are ""locked in"" with local businesses, staff and supply chains.
Marks & Spencer, for example, has 48 shops in Russia but they are operated by a Turkish franchise company called FiBA. M&S has said it is suspending shipments of its goods to FiBA's Russian business, but the shops in the country remain open.
Restaurant Brands International, which owns Burger King, told the BBC its Russian outlets were operated by franchisees  with which it had ""long-standing legal agreements"" that were not easy to change.
Yum Brands, which owns KFC and Pizza Hut, said it was suspending operations in the Russian KFC restaurants it owns, and finalising an agreement with its main franchisee to temporarily halt Pizza Hut operations.
Mr Weafer predicts it is likely that some large consumer brands may express concerns over the military conflict, but try to ""ride it out"".

Three people including a child died when Russia struck a hospital on Wednesday
Twitter has removed two posts by the Russian embassy in London which claimed the bombing of a Ukrainian hospital by Russian forces had been faked.
The Mariupol hospital was attacked on Wednesday, leaving three people dead.
But the embassy's tweets made unfounded claims the hospital was not operational at the time, and that injured women pictured at the scene were actors.
Twitter told the BBC the tweets violated rules ""related to the denial of violent events"".
Officials at the embassy have offered no proof to back up their claims, and the BBC's disinformation team has found evidence which contradicts the allegations. 
The embassy claimed the hospital had been ""long non-operational"". However, a week-old post on the hospital's Facebook page, external asked for fuel to keep operations going.
Reports from Mariupol last week - from the Associated Press news agency and Sky News - also says it was treating bombing victims, and that the maternity ward had been moved to the basement.
The allegation that a beauty blogger was used to fake photos of a pregnant woman at the scene was also called into question, as the woman in question, who lives in the city, is seen heavily pregnant in Instagram posts dating from last month., external
This tweet was deleted by Twitter for violating its rules
The initial claims that the bombing was faked by Ukraine did not come from the embassy. They first began trending among Russian users of the Telegram messaging app earlier in the day, and were then mentioned on state television news bulletins and chat shows.
A further claim circulating that the beauty blogger also pretended to be another woman caught up in the bombing and photographed at the scene is also untrue. A look at high-resolution images of the other woman featured in the claims shows she looks nothing like the beauty blogger. Those are two different women.
Finally there were accusations that the hospital had been taken over by a far-right battalion of the Ukrainian army. As yet there is no evidence that this was the case.
These claims all continue to circulate online, despite the tweets being removed.
The pregnant beauty blogger's Instagram account has also now become a target for online trolls and conspiracy theorists.
Social media companies have been trying to tackle misinformation on their platforms, with many big tech companies blocking Russian broadcasters RT and Sputnik. 
But Twitter has not banned several accounts linked to Russian government organisations - including Vladimir Putin's official Twitter account.
The Russian embassy account also remains active.

The owner of Facebook and Instagram will allow users in some countries to call for violence against Vladimir Putin and Russian soldiers. 
Meta says it has temporarily made allowances for some violent speech, like ""death to the Russian invaders,"" that would usually break its rules. 
However, it says it won't permit calls for violence against Russian civilians.
In response, Russia called on the US to stop the social media giant's ""extremist activities"".
The announcement came after Reuters news agency said it had seen internal emails outlining the policy shift.
""In light of the ongoing invasion of Ukraine, we made a temporary exception for those affected by the war, to express violent sentiments toward invading armed forces,"" a Meta spokesperson told the BBC.
Under the amended policy, users in countries including Russia, Ukraine and Poland will also be able to call for the deaths of Russia's President Putin and Belarusian President Lukashenko.
The emails reportedly said calls for the leaders' deaths will be allowed unless they contain other targets, or included a location or methods.
Could Putin be prosecuted for war crimes?
Calls for violence against Russians are also allowed when the post is clearly references the invasion of Ukraine, the emails reportedly said.
""We demand that US authorities stop the extremist activities of Meta, take measures to bring the perpetrators to justice,"" Russia's embassy in the US tweeted.
""Users of Facebook & Instagram did not give the owners of these platforms the right to determine the criteria of truth and pit nations against each other,"" it added.

Watch: Jussie Smollett shouts in courtroom after jail sentencing
US actor Jussie Smollett has been sentenced to 150 days in jail after a jury found he lied to police about being the victim of a hate crime.
The former Empire star, 39, was found guilty in December of five charges of felony disorderly conduct after making false reports about the hoax attack.
The sentence also includes 30 months of probation and $145,000 (£110,000) in restitution and fines.
Following the sentence, Smollett said: ""I did not do this!""
The trial stemmed from an incident three years ago when Smollett said he was attacked by two assailants.
The actor, who is black and gay, said the attackers shouted slurs at him and a Trump slogan, dumped a ""chemical substance"" on him and tied a noose around his neck while he was walking late at night in January 2019.
Authorities opened an investigation, but in February of that year, police charged Smollett with filing a false police report, alleging he had staged the assault.
At trial last year, a jury of six men and six women heard from brothers Abimbola and Olabinjo Osundairo, who testified Smollett paid them to orchestrate the attack and paid them $3,500 to carry it out.
Smollett faced up to three years in prison for each of the five counts. The first 150 days of his probation will be spent in custody, beginning immediately.
He must also pay $120,106 in restitution to the city of Chicago and $25,000 in fines - the maximum allowable by law.
Throughout the trial, Smollett maintained that he had been the victim of a crime.
How the Jussie Smollett drama unfolded
In court on Thursday, his defence team again asked that the case be thrown out or declared a mistrial, citing a previous prosecutor's 2019 promise to drop the charges.
Prosecutors characterised the effort as ""finger-pointing and scapegoating"".
Smollet, seen here in March 2019, is known for his role in the TV series Empire
Additionally, the judge heard from several witnesses who testified on Smollett's behalf in a bid for leniency. Letters were also read from the likes of civil rights leader Jesse Jackson and actor Samuel L Jackson.
""Jussie should not be incarcerated,"" his brother Joel said. ""He is not a threat to the people of Illinois.""
A victim impact statement on behalf of the Chicago Police Department read in court said police officers had committed more than 30 officers to the investigation - spread over 1,426 regular hours and 1,837 overtime hours. 
They had interviewed dozens of witnesses, watched thousands of hours of surveillance videos and gone door-to-door during Chicago's Polar Vortex - one of the coldest periods in the city's history, it said.
Judge James Linn repeatedly addressed Smollett directly and noted that the ""unprecedented"" media attention the case attracted is usually reserved for murder cases.
""There is nothing that I can do here today that can come close to the damage you've already done to your own life,"" Mr Linn told Smollett. ""You've turned your life upside down by your conduct and shenanigans.""
""You're just a charlatan pretending to be a victim of a hate crime, and that's shameful,"" Mr Linn later added.
Following the sentencing, Smollett left the courtroom with a raised fist, and exclaimed: ""I am innocent, and I am not suicidal.""
""If I did this, then it means that I stuck my fist in the fears of black Americans in this country for over 400 years and the fears of the LGBT community,"" he said. ""But I did not do this.""
Smollett's acting career stalled after the incident. He lost his role as a singer-songwriter in the final season of Empire, a Fox television hip-hop drama.

Why does North Korea keep launching missiles?
The US says N Korea recently tested parts of a new intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) system, in what it called a ""serious escalation"".
Pyongyang said the launches on 26 February and 4 March focused on developing a reconnaissance satellite.
But the Pentagon now says the tests were experimental launches, before a likely full-range ICBM launch.
With a minimum range of 5,500km (3,417 miles), ICBMs can reach the US. They are designed for nuclear arms delivery.
On Thursday, Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said North Korea's two tests ""involved a new intercontinental ballistic missile system"". 
Neither launch displayed ICBM range or capability, but the tests were carried out ""to evaluate this new system before conducting a test at full range in the future, potentially disguised as a space launch,"" Mr Kirby said.
""The United States strongly condemns these launches, which are a brazen violation of multiple United Nations Security Council resolutions, needlessly raise tensions and risk destabilising the security situation in the region.""
Both South Korea and Japan have confirmed the US statement and condemned Pyongyang. 
Here we go again. And we can't say we were not warned.
North Korea has spent over a year saying that it would return to testing bigger and better weapons. They even displayed them in a military parade and exhibitions.
Pyongyang has carried out several short-range missile tests which will have helped their scientists try out new technology. But testing long range intercontinental ballistic missiles really make Washington sit up and take notice.
Why? Because these missiles put the US mainland within striking distance, as North Korea demonstrated during its launches in 2017.
The Hwasong-12 was thought to be able to reach as far as 4,500km (2,800 miles), putting US military bases on the Pacific island of Guam well within striking distance. The Hwasong-14 demonstrated even greater potential, with a range of 8,000km.
Only the US, Russia and China have land-based missiles of this range.
Kim Jong-un has warned he will launch ""many satellites"" soon, which Washington and Seoul will see as an attempt to try out the same technology as an ICBM.
The allies have stepped up surveillance in the region. More sanctions will be announced.
Once again, it seems tensions may return to the Korean peninsula, just as Seoul elects a new conservative president who has pledged to be tougher on Pyongyang.
In a statement released on Friday, South Korea's defence ministry linked the two recent launches to a ""newly developing ICBM system"" that had been previously unveiled by North Korea's ruling party during a military parade in October. 
Seoul also ""strongly condemned"" the tests, whereas Japan called them a ""threat to peace and security... that can never be tolerated.""
A senior US official described the tests as a ""serious escalation"", adding that the US would slap further sanctions against North Korea on Friday.
North Korea's missile and nuclear programme
N Korea missile tests: What does Kim Jong-un want?
The official, who was speaking on condition of anonymity, said the new measures would prevent Pyongyang from accessing ""foreign items and technology"" to further develop its missile programme.
North Korea is already under biting international sanctions over its missile and nuclear weapons programme.
Pyongyang has not conducted any ICBM or nuclear tests since 2017, though North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has at times hinted he may do so. 
The North put a moratorium in place on testing long-range ballistic missiles and nuclear tests after talks with then US President Donald Trump. But in 2020, Mr Kim announced he was no longer bound by this promise.

Chelsea FC owner Roman Abramovich has been sanctioned by the UK government as part of its response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
He is one of seven oligarchs to be hit with fresh sanctions, external, including asset freezes and travel bans.
The list also includes billionaires Igor Sechin and Oleg Deripaska, both seen as allies of Vladimir Putin.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson said ""there can be no safe havens"" for those who have supported the invasion.
Live: Latest developments in Ukraine war 
Who are the mega-rich Russians facing sanctions?
Chelsea FC cannot sell any more tickets for games, its merchandise shop will be closed, and it will be unable to buy or sell players on the transfer market.
The government said it would issue a special licence that allows fixtures to be fulfilled, staff to be paid and existing ticket holders to attend matches.
Ministers have come under pressure to sanction Mr Abramovich, who said he had made the ""difficult decision"" to sell Chelsea FC earlier this month.
The football club is among the assets frozen as part of the sanctions against Mr Abramovich and its sale has now been stalled.
Roman Abramovich and Vladimir Putin pictured together at an event in Russia in 2016
But the BBC understands the government would consider allowing Mr Abramovich to apply for a special licence to sell the club, providing he can prove he would not benefit from the sale.
Mr Abramovich, 55, is alleged to have strong ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin, which he has denied.
The government says Mr Abramovich, who has an estimated net worth of £9.4bn, is ""one of the few oligarchs from the 1990s to maintain prominence under Putin"". 
Mr Abramovich has stakes in steel giant Evraz and Norilsk Nickel. He sold a 73% stake in Russian oil firm Sibneft to state-owned gas titan Gazprom for £9.87bn in 2005.
He is believed to own a number of properties in the UK, including a 15-bedroom mansion at Kensington Palace Gardens in west London, reportedly valued at more than £150m.
Chelsea reassurances
While the sanctions against him throw Chelsea's future in doubt, ministers sought to reassure the club it would not be ""unnecessarily harmed"".
In a tweet, external, Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries said holding those who have ""enabled the Putin regime to account"" was the priority.

""I know this brings some uncertainty, but the government will work with the league and clubs to keep football being played while ensuring sanctions hit those intended,"" she wrote.
When asked if being unable to sell tickets and merchandise would hit Chelsea's finances, the culture secretary said: ""Sanctions have consequences and that's a fact.""
London Mayor Sadiq Khan expressed support for the government's actions but said Chelsea fans were ""completely innocent"" and that it was important to ensure the club was not ""sold off in a fire sale"".

Nadine Dorries says her focus is to protect Chelsea FC, its fans and the ""national game""
Telecommunications company Three, said it would temporarily suspend its sponsorship of the club and would ""request the removal of our brand from shirts and around the stadium until further notice"".
Chelsea has enjoyed major success since Mr Abramovich bought the club in 2003 for £140m, winning major titles including the Champions League, the Premier League and the FA Cup.
The club's fans were heard chanting Mr Abramovich's name during a match against Norwich on Thursday evening. 
Mr Abramovich has previously said that proceeds of the club's sale would be donated to victims of war.
On Wednesday, there were 20 credible interested parties looking at a potential Chelsea takeover, including British businessman Nick Candy.
Analysis from BBC home affairs correspondent Daniel Sandford
Like all the Russian billionaires who still run businesses in their motherland, Roman Abramovich has had to remain on good terms with President Putin, even though he no longer spends much time in the country.
This is what led to him being sanctioned, with the UK government saying he is a ""pro-Kremlin oligarch"" who had has a ""close relationship"" with Vladimir Putin for decades and has obtained ""financial benefit"" and ""preferential treatment"" from that relationship.
One example given of that is the contracts he received in the run up to the FIFA 2018 World Cup.
More specifically on Ukraine and the Russian army, the UK government claims one of Mr Abramovich's companies, Evraz Plc, may ""potentially"" have been involved in providing steel which ""may have been used in the production of tanks"".
It is probably now too late for Roman Abramovich to recover his position and he may find himself being sanctioned by the US and the EU as well. 
Like many Russian businessmen he is now likely to turn to China.
The UK and its western allies have been ratcheting up sanctions against individuals and companies linked to President Putin since the invasion of Ukraine was launched on 24 February.
The government said Thursday's sanctions against ""seven of Russia's wealthiest and most influential oligarchs"" were part of the UK's ""efforts to isolate Putin and those around him"".
Among those sanctioned was Oleg Deripaska, a leading industrialist who has had links with British politicians.
Once one of the richest men linked to President Putin, Mr Deripaska made billions from his stake in Russia's aluminium industries, including EN+ Group, and has a multi-million pound property portfolio in the UK.
Media reports have named Mr Deripaska as the owner of a property on Belgrave Square, one of London's most exclusive neighbourhoods.
His net worth is now an estimated £2bn, according to the Foreign Office, and he has been subject to US sanctions since 2018, external.
Unlike other Russian oligarchs, who have remained silent on the war in Ukraine so far, Mr Deripaska has called for ""peace as soon as possible"" in a tweet, external.

Igor Sechin is another wealthy businessman who is said to have deep ties to President Putin.
Named Putin's right-hand man by the UK, Mr Sechin worked with the president when he was mayor in St Petersburg in the 1990s.
Igor Sechin is the chief executive of Rosneft, a Russian state oil company, and has been sanctioned by the US and EU.
In its statement, external, the government said the four others sanctioned included:
Andrey Kostin, chairman of VTB bank. He ""has long supported Kremlin objectives"" through the bank, which has already been sanctioned by the UK
Alexei Miller, CEO of energy company Gazprom. An ally of Mr Putin from his St Petersburg days, he is ""one of the most important executives supporting the Russian government""
Nikolai Tokarev, president of the Russia state-owned pipeline company Transneft, He served with Mr Putin as a KGB officer in Dresden in East Germany in the 1980s and the pair have ""remained closely associated ever since""
Dmitri Lebedev, chairman of the board of directors of Bank Rossiya. Sanctioned by the UK, IS ""widely considered to be the Kremlin's private bank""
The UK has now sanctioned 18 oligarchs since the invasion of Ukraine began, a Downing Street spokesperson said.
In addition to President Putin, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and four Belarusian generals, 23 high-profile Russian oligarchs were now on the UK's sanctions list, the spokesperson said.
Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said the government had targeted the oligarchs to ""ramp up the pressure on the Putin regime and choke off funds to his brutal war machine"".
She said: ""With their close links to Putin they are complicit in his aggression.
""The blood of the Ukrainian people is on their hands. They should hang their heads in shame.""
Labour's shadow foreign secretary David Lammy said the sanctions were the ""right decision"" but ""should not have taken the government weeks"".
""Too few oligarchs linked to Putin's rogue regime have so far faced sanctions from the UK government,"" Mr Lammy said.
The government has been accused of moving slower than western allies the US and the EU in its sanctioning of individuals linked to President Putin.
The government's Economic Crime Bill, which is expected to become law later this month, is designed to harden and quicken these sanctions.
The government says the bill will also stop wealthy Russians using the City of London for money laundering and hiding gains linked to organised crime.

Chelsea have won 10 games away from home in the Premier League
Chelsea beat bottom club Norwich as Mason Mount scored one and made another on the day his club's long-term future was thrown into uncertainty.
Travelling fans at Carrow Road chanted the name of Roman Abramovich hours after it was announced Chelsea's Russian owner had been sanctioned by the UK government.
On the pitch, Chelsea's players responded to one of the most dramatic days in the club's 117-year history by storming into a 2-0 lead inside the opening 15 minutes on their way to a fourth successive league win.
Trevoh Chalobah opened the scoring in the third minute after meeting Mason Mount's corner before Kai Havertz set up England's Mount for his eighth goal of the season.
Norwich were much better after half-time and Teemu Pukki gave his side hope from the penalty spot after Chalobah handled, but Havertz sealed the points with a late third for Chelsea.
While the win strengthened Chelsea's grip on third spot, Norwich are five points from safety with just 10 games left.

Norwich 1-3 Chelsea: Thomas Tuchel praises Blues 'brilliant' performance against Canaries
Business as usual on the pitch
While Chelsea's future off the pitch is precarious right now, it was pretty much business as usual on it.
Captain Cesar Azpilicueta spoke before the game about ""this not being a normal day"" while boss Thomas Tuchel talked about ""a lot of noise"" around the club.
Within hours of the announcement that Abramovich had been sanctioned, Chelsea' main shirt sponsors - mobile network provider Three - suspended its deal with the club.
Nevertheless, the Blues wore their usual kit with the sponsors logo as the timing of Three's suspension made it impossible to get a fresh kit with no logo to Norfolk.
There were 'Champions of Europe' banners in the away end although the Abramovich chants were greeted with some boos from the home fans.
Yet any concerns Tuchel might have had about the day's worrying off-field developments seeping onto the pitch were quickly dispelled as Chelsea raced into a 2-0 lead.
Chalobah got between Grant Hanley and Christoph Zimmermann to put the visitors ahead before Mount lashed home the second high into the roof of the net.
Andreas Christensen - out of contract at the end of the season and in a state of short-term limbo following today's announcement that Chelsea are unable to offer new deals - went close with a header.
Mateo Kovacic grazed the woodwork from 20 yards and Mount was denied a second goal by Tim Krul before Havertz sealed Chelsea's 10th Premier League away win with a fine 90th minute finish after a lay-off by N'Golo Kante.

Norwich 1-3 Chelsea: Dean Smith disappointed by 'passive' performance
Another hard-luck tale
With the flag of Ukraine flying at Carrow Road, Norwich produced a spirited second-half performance before Havertz's fifth goal in his last six appearances killed off their hopes of salvaging a point.
This was another hard-luck tale in a season of hard-luck tales for Dean Smith's side.
Having got to half-time having conceded only two goals, they came out fighting in the second half but were unable to avoid a 19th top-flight defeat of the season.
Smith will still believe his side can avoid a quick-fire return to the Championship.
Norwich still have to entertain fellow strugglers Burnley but time is running out of the Canaries.
They have 10 matches left including games against West Ham (home), Tottenham (home) and Manchester United (away), who are all chasing European places.

251,251,Covid deaths probably three times higher than records say,"Fri, 11 Mar 2022 00:19:39 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-60690251,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-60690251?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,"Official records say six million have died, but the true figure may be over 18 million, say researchers.","Covid deaths probably three times higher than records say
More than 18 million people - three times higher than official records suggest - have probably died because of Covid, say researchers.
Their report comes two years to the day from when the World Health Organization first declared the pandemic. 
The Covid-19 excess mortality team at the US's Washington University studied 191 countries and territories for what they call the true global death figure. 
Some deaths were from the virus, while others were linked to the infection. 
This is because catching Covid might worsen other pre-existing medical conditions, such as heart or lung disease, for example. 
The measure used is called excess deaths - how many more people have been dying than would be expected compared to recent years, before the pandemic hit.
How are different countries faring with Covid?
How new drugs are finally taming the virus
To calculate this, the researchers gathered data through searches of various government websites, the World Mortality Database,, external the Human Mortality Database,, external and the European Statistical Office., external
Rates of excess deaths are estimated to have varied dramatically by country and region, but the overall global rate calculated in the study is 120 deaths per 100,000 people. 
That would mean about 18.2 million deaths have happened because of Covid in the two years between the start of 2020 and the end of 2021 - three times as many as the official 5.9 million that have actually been recorded. 
Excess death estimates were calculated for the full study period only, and not by week or month, because of lags and inconsistencies in reporting of Covid death data that could drastically alter the estimates, the investigators stress.
According to the research, which is published in The Lancet,, external the highest rates were in lower income countries in Latin America, Europe and sub-Saharan Africa. But deaths were also fairly high in some high-income countries, such as Italy and parts of the US.
The five countries with the highest estimated excess death rates were:
Bolivia 
Bulgaria 
Eswatini 
North Macedonia
Lesotho
The five with the lowest were:
Iceland 
Australia
Singapore 
New Zealand
Taiwan
For the UK, the estimated total number of Covid-related deaths in 2020 and 2021 was similar to official records at about 173,000, with an excess mortality rate of 130 people per 100,000.
Lead author Dr Haidong Wang, from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation,, external said: ""Understanding the true death toll from the pandemic is vital for effective public health decision-making.
""Studies from several countries, including Sweden and the Netherlands, suggest Covid was the direct cause of most excess deaths, but we currently don't have enough evidence for most locations.
""Further research will help to reveal how many deaths were caused directly by Covid, and how many occurred as an indirect result of the pandemic."" 
The researchers predict that excess mortality linked to the pandemic will decline, thanks to vaccines and new treatments. 
But they warn that the pandemic is not yet over. And new, dangerous variants of the virus could emerge.

The draft terms of reference for the UK public inquiry into the government's handling of the Covid-19 pandemic have been published.
It will look at preparedness, the public health response, the health and care sector response and the economic response, the Cabinet Office said.
The probe will play a key role in ""learning lessons"" from the pandemic and for the future, it said.
The inquiry is due to start in the spring.
The terms of reference were published, external after a consultation with inquiry chairwoman and former High Court judge Baroness Hallett, and with ministers in the devolved nations.
Representatives of the inquiry will travel to towns and cities across the UK in the coming weeks to meet with people impacted by the pandemic and hear their views on what should be investigated.
The Scottish government has already published the terms of reference for its own Covid-19 inquiry, to be led by Judge Lady Poole.
The UK-wide inquiry proposes examining a broad range of issues including:
the UK's preparedness for the pandemic
the use of lockdowns and other 'non-pharmaceutical' interventions such as social distancing and the use of face coverings
the management of the pandemic in hospitals and care homes 
the procurement and provision of equipment like personal protective equipment and ventilators 
support for businesses and jobs, including the furlough scheme, as well as benefits and sick pay.
The inquiry aims to produce ""a factual, narrative account"" covering decision-making at all levels of government and the response of the health and care sector as well as identifying the ""lessons to be learned"".
The draft document said the inquiry would ""produce its reports (including interim reports) and any recommendations in a timely manner"".
In the UK, more than 162,000 people have died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus since the start of the pandemic in early 2020.
The Cabinet Office said the UK-wide inquiry would ""reflect the importance of understanding the experiences of those most affected by the pandemic"" such as bereaved families and examine any ""disparities"" in the impact of the pandemic and the government's response.
It said there would now be a further public consultation led by Baroness Hallett to consider any changes to the terms before they are finalised.
Baroness Hallett said she would open the public consultation into the scope of the inquiry, which will run until 7 April.
In a statement, she reiterated it was independent and urged people across the UK to share their views on what it should cover, especially those ""who have been bereaved, experienced hardship or suffered other harm"".

Becky Kummer, spokesperson for Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice, said the publication was a ""huge step forward"" and the organisation looked forward to contributing to the consultation on the terms.
Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents hospital trusts, said there was much the NHS did well during the pandemic but: ""It is right the inquiry looks at areas where there were major challenges - such as infection prevention and control, access to PPE, testing, and robust epidemiological modelling.""
He said trust leaders welcomed the inquiry covering ""the nation's preparedness, initial capacity, and resilience ahead of, and during the pandemic, and the important focus on inequalities"".
Emma Norris, director of research at the Institute for Government think tank, said on Twitter, external the inquiry's ""huge remit"" had ""likely implications for the length and timeliness of the inquiry"", adding: ""A wide scope usually means a longer inquiry.""
To avoid a lengthy inquiry, she said a large team would be needed to probe different issues concurrently, but that the mention of interim reports was ""positive"".
Barrister and Covid lockdown regulations expert Adam Wagner also said on first look, the draft terms of reference appeared to be ""very wide"".
In a Twitter thread, external, he said they failed to mention explicitly the policing of the pandemic, the government's hotel quarantine policy for people arriving in the UK from abroad and the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions on human rights.
He said these elements would ""hopefully"" be covered by the items ""the use of lockdowns"" and ""travel and borders"".
As the terms stand, he predicted it would be ""a massive, long and difficult"" inquiry with ""many strands and elements"".
Several reports have already put the UK government's handling of the pandemic under the spotlight.
A report by MPs on the Health and Social Care Committee and the Science and Technology Committee last October said the UK's failure to do more to stop Covid spreading early in the pandemic was one of the country's worst public health failures.
It said the government approach - backed by its scientists - was to try to manage the situation and in effect achieve herd immunity by infection. 
The MPs said this led to a delay in introducing the first lockdown, costing thousands of lives.
A report by spending watchdog the National Audit Office (NAO) last November found ministers were not properly prepared for a pandemic like Covid-19 and lacked detailed plans on shielding, job support schemes and school disruption.
The government said the unprecedented pandemic had challenged health systems around the world - not just the UK.

Year 6 pupils in Sheffield have been trying to catch up after the disruption
The ""devastating"" impact of England's school closures during the pandemic is leading to greater inequality, MPs say. 
A report by the Education Select Committee found Yorkshire and the Humber, and the North East are the worst-affected areas. 
It warns the flagship National Tutoring Programme is falling far short, external of its targets this year. 
The government said it aimed to ensure as many children as possible received high-quality catch-up tutoring. 
The committee gathered evidence about how education in England is recovering after two years of disruption. 
The report calls for the government to ""refocus"" its efforts on a ""fragmented and bureaucratic"" catch-up programme.  
School catch-up tsar resigns over lack of funding
Telling children to catch up 'adds huge pressure'
Primary maths is one of the subjects where there are shocking regional differences: the average learning loss was 0.5 months in the South West, 0.9 months in London, four months in the North East and 5.3 months in Yorkshire and the Humber. 
At Greenhill Primary School in Sheffield, it has been one of the subjects where pupils have been offered extra teaching to recover lost ground. 
Year 6 teacher Toni Whitehouse said there had been a ""massive impact"" from the classroom closure, and not just on learning. 
""We found children couldn't sit still, hold a discussion, collaborate with other children,"" she said.
As well as covering new topics, teachers have had to reinstil some of the basics.
""Coming back from Covid, I've got children who can't use capital letters, full stops, the kind of skills we taught them when they were four or five.""
Nicola said she lost confidence because of the disruption to classes
Annabel, one of the Year 6 pupils, said booster classes with her teachers have really helped after the disruption. 
""I think it's helped with my arithmetic and reasoning. We didn't get to do much in lockdown. I lost quite a lot of confidence.""
Nicola, also in Year 6, said despite extra help she is worried about going to secondary school.  
""My confidence with learning got a bit messed up - with a year-and-a-half of learning partly at home with your family around you.""
Long-term damage
The risk of failing to make up for the learning loss from the pandemic is rated as ""critical or very likely"" by the Department for Education itself in its annual report. 
Robert Halfon, chairman of the Education Select Committee, thinks the damage could be long term
""This is incredibly serious, children have lost months of learning, disadvantaged children are between five to eight months behind in maths.
""We are damaging their life chances if we don't get this catch-up programme right.""
He is also worried that if the almost £5bn committed so far isn't well spent, it could be hard to persuade the Treasury to give more funding to education. 
Toni Whitehouse said disruption had had a massive impact
Greenhill is part of a group of nine primary schools spread across Sheffield in very different parts of the city. 
Chief executive Nicola Shipman says some schools have seen children more affected by the pandemic than others. 
Confusing funding
They tried using one part of the National Tutoring Programme, which is the main part of the government's catch-up programme, to get academic mentors for pupils. However, they found it wasn't easy to recruit enough good people.
This year instead, like many schools, they have used their own staff to run extra sessions with some extra government funding, rather than using tutoring agencies through the national scheme.   
Ms Shipman said: ""There needs to be a rethink, about how that money can be better spent by those of us who know our children better.""
Schools can bid for funding from the National Tutoring Programme to organise extra tutoring themselves for disadvantaged pupils, or seek to be matched with tutoring agencies and academic mentors for pupils. This is via the private company Randstad, which won the contract. 
However, MPs say it has only reached 52,000 courses so far  - just 10% of this year's target for tutoring courses.  
They criticised the lack of transparency around the contract, and a decision to relax a target to reach mainly poorer pupils with tutoring. 
Unless performance improves, the report calls for the contract with Randstad to be scrapped. 
It adds the current ""spaghetti junction"" of confusing funding should be replaced by giving money directly to the schools and areas that need it most. 
So far almost £5bn has been committed to education recovery in England.
A Department for Education spokesperson said: ""Tutoring plays an integral role in supporting pupils to catch up on any lost learning, and delivery is on track to meet the ambitious target of teaching two million courses this academic year.
""We continue to work with Randstad to ensure as many children from all backgrounds - in particular those from disadvantaged backgrounds - across the country can benefit from high-quality tutoring and catch up on lost learning.""

The scale of the destruction in the besieged Ukrainian city of Mariupol has been revealed in a series of photos and satellite images.
Residential areas have been flattened, a shopping centre destroyed and a maternity hospital attacked. The southern port city has used at least one mass grave to bury the dead.
Mariupol, a city of about 400,000, has been subjected to days of heavy bombardment.
Its people are running dangerously short of food and water, the city's deputy mayor Sergei Orlov, says, and there is ""no electricity, no water supply, no heating, no sanitary system"".
People are being forced to melt snow to drink, and chop wood to cook and keep warm in sub-zero temperatures, he says.
On Wednesday, three people - including a child - were killed and 17 wounded in a devastating strike that destroyed a maternity ward and children's ward of a hospital.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky described the attack as a war crime.
A short distance away, damage could be seen on the roads close to the university, which also suffered heavy damage.
Images from satellite technology company Maxar have also revealed damage to residential areas to the south and east of the city, now virtually cut off from the outside world.
Another image shows the damage done to a shopping centre to the west. The roofs of two buildings have been completely destroyed.
Mariupol is a key strategic target for Russia. Seizing it would allow Russian-backed rebels in eastern Ukraine to join forces with troops in Crimea - the southern peninsula annexed by Russia in 2014.

South African President Cyril Ramaphosa has said Vladimir Putin will no longer attend a summit there in August.
The International Criminal Court (ICC) has issued a warrant for the Russian president's arrest. 
As a signatory to the court, South Africa should detain suspects in its territory, but President Ramaphosa warned Russia would see this as a declaration of war. 
What is a war crime, and what is the ICC?
The rules for war are spelt out in the Geneva Conventions, and other international laws and agreements.
Serious offences such as murder, rape or mass persecution of a group are known as ""crimes against humanity"" or, in some circumstances, ""genocide"".
Military forces cannot deliberately attack civilians - nor the infrastructure that they depend on, such as power stations.
Some weapons are banned, external, such as anti-personnel landmines, and chemical or biological weapons. 
The sick and wounded must be cared for - including injured soldiers, who have rights as prisoners of war. 
The ICC, based in The Hague, was set up to investigate war crimes and crimes against humanity.
It often holds trials on behalf of countries with weak judicial systems, which are unable to prosecute such cases in their own courts.
What are the allegations against President Putin?
The UN Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine says Russian authorities took 16,221 children out of Ukraine to Russia. 
It said these deportations ""violate international humanitarian law and amount to a war crime"".
Mariupol theatre after the air strike
The UN has also said that Russian forces in Ukraine are responsible for rapes, ""widespread"" torture and killings:
March 2022: Russian forces carried out an air strike on a theatre in Mariupol which was sheltering children, and attacked a hospital in the city
April 2022: the bodies of 400 civilians were found in Bucha, near Kyiv
September 2022: 450 bodies - mostly of civilians - were found in Izium, in the Kharkiv region
Ukraine has also accused Russian forces of committing more than 400 war crimes in the Kherson region between March and November 2022. 
In addition, the UN says Russia could be responsible for ""crimes against humanity"" by attacking civilian infrastructure such as power stations and dams.
Russia has denied all allegations of war crimes or targeting civilians. 
Russia faces war crimes investigation over Ukraine
How is South Africa involved? 
President Putin was due to visit the country in August to attend a conference of the Brics nations (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa).
South Africa's main opposition party, Democratic Alliance, asked the courts to order his arrest, should he arrive. 
South Africa has invited Russian President Vladimir Putin to a conference in August
However, in documents submitted to the court, President Ramaphosa said this must not happen: ""Russia has made it clear that arresting its sitting president would be a declaration of war.""
Later, he said that he and President Putin had ""mutually"" agreed he should not come. Russia's foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, will attend instead. 
South Africa has ignored the ICC before.
In 2015, it refused to arrest Sudan's then-president, Omar al-Bashir and let him fly out from a South African airbase. 
The ICC had charged him with genocide and war crimes in connection with the conflict in the Darfur region. 
Could the ICC try Putin?
The ICC can bring a prosecution against political leaders for ""waging aggressive war"" in the event of an unjustified invasion, or conflict not undertaken in self-defence. 
It has been investigating potential war crimes and crimes against humanity in Ukraine carried out as far as 2013, before Russia illegally annexed Crimea. 
In March 2023, it issued arrest warrants against President Putin and Russia's Commissioner for Children's Rights, Ms Maria Lvova-Belova. 
However, Russia is not a signatory to the ICC, so is highly unlikely to extradite Putin or Ms Lvova-Belova. 
The president is not expected to travel to any country which might arrest him.

How has Ukraine dealt with war crimes?
The first conviction for war crimes in the Ukrainian courts happened in May 2022, when 21-year-old Russian tank commander Vadim Shishimarin was jailed for life. 
He was found guilty of shooting an unarmed civilian, 62-year-old Oleksandr Shelipov, in the north-eastern village of Chupakhivka, a few days after the invasion began. 
Vadim Shishimarin was the first Russian soldier to be tried for war crimes
At the start of July 2022, Ukraine's prosecutor-general, Iryna Venediktova, said her office was investigating more than 21,000 war crimes and crimes of aggression allegedly committed by Russian forces since the start of the conflict.
She said 600 suspects had been identified, and 80 prosecutions had begun.
According to Reuters, in March 2023, at least 26 war crimes suspects had been convicted by Ukrainian courts.

259,259,Ukraine: What sanctions are being imposed on Russia?,"Thu, 10 Mar 2022 17:16:09 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-60125659,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-60125659?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,Western nations have imposed severe sanctions on Russia over its invasion of Ukraine.,"What are the sanctions on Russia and have they affected its economy?
The US, UK and EU have announced new sanctions on Russia, two years after its invasion of Ukraine.
The measures also marked a week since the death in custody of opposition leader Alexei Navalny.
What are sanctions?
Sanctions are penalties imposed by one country on another, to stop them acting aggressively or breaking international law.
They are among the toughest measures nations can take, short of going to war. 
What are the latest sanctions on Russia?
Announcing 500 new sanctions against Russia, US President Joe Biden said they would target Russia's war machine. Export restrictions will be imposed on nearly 100 firms or individuals.
President Biden said the measures would also target people connected with the imprisonment of Mr Navalny, who died in an Arctic penal camp. 
The UK has frozen the assets of six bosses at the prison and banned them from travelling to the UK. 
The UK has also imposed new bans on Russian metal, diamond and energy exports.
The EU has announced sanctions on 200 organisations and people, external which it says are helping Russia acquire weapons, or taking Ukrainian children from their homes. 
The sanctions include companies and individuals involved in shipping North Korean armaments to Russia.
Alexei Navalny: What we know about his death 
What other sanctions have been imposed on Russia?
Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the US, UK and EU, along with countries including Australia, Canada and Japan, have imposed more than 16,500 sanctions on Russia, external.
Their main target has been Russia's money.
Foreign currency reserves worth $350bn (£276bn) - about half its total reserves - were frozen.
About 70% of the assets of Russian banks, external were also frozen, the EU says, and some were excluded from Swift, a high-speed messaging service for financial institutions.
Western nations have also:
banned exports of technology Russia might use for making weapons
banned imports of gold and diamonds from Russia 
banned flights from Russia
sanctioned oligarchs - the wealthy business people linked with the Kremlin  - and impounded their yachts
Roman Abramovich, former owner of Chelsea FC, is one oligarch who has been sanctioned
Russia's oil industry has been another major target.
The US and UK banned Russian oil and natural gas. The EU has banned seaborne crude imports.
The G7 - an organisation of the world's seven largest ""advanced"" economies - has imposed a maximum price of $60 (£47) a barrel, external on Russian crude oil, to try to reduce its earnings.
Which Western companies have left Russia?
Hundreds of major firms, including McDonald's, Coca-Cola, Starbucks and Heineken, have stopped selling and making goods in Russia. 
However, some still do business in Russia. 
PepsiCo, for example, has been accused of continuing to sell food products in Russia. And the BBC discovered that US cosmetics firm Avon was making goods in a factory near Moscow.
How has Russia evaded sanctions?
President Vladimir Putin has claimed European sanctions have done Russia no harm, saying: ""We have growth, and they have decline."", external
Russia has managed to sell oil abroad for more than the G7's price cap, external, according to the Atlantic Council, a US think tank. It says a ""shadow fleet"" of about 1,000 tankers is used to ship it, external.
The International Energy Agency says Russia is still exporting 8.3 million barrels of oil a day, external - having increased supplies to India and China.
Russia is also able to import many sanctioned Western goods, external by buying them through countries such as Georgia, Belarus and Kazakhstan, according to researchers at King's College London. 
China has been a vital supplier of alternative hi-tech products to those produced in the West, says Dr Maria Snegovaya from the US think tank, the Center for Strategic and International Studies.
""China sells it chips and other components it needs to for keep its military production going,"" she says. ""Russia wouldn't be able to pull that off without China's help.""
Russian oil getting into UK via refinery loophole
What support is China giving Russia? 
What impact have sanctions had on Russia's economy?
In 2022, the first year of the war, Russia's economy shrank by 2.1%, external, according to the International Monetary Fund.
However, it estimates that Russia's economy grew by 2.2% in 2023 and predicts growth of 1.1% in 2024.
Nevertheless, the US Treasury claims sanctions are damaging Russia, having cut 5% from the economic growth, external it might have had over the past two years.
But Dr Snegovaya suggests: ""Sanctions have not made waging this war sufficiently costly for Russia, and that means it can continue with it for some time to come"".
The US Treasury also says that the war in Ukraine and sanctions have led more than a million people, external - many of them young and highly educated - to leave Russia. 
Russia's government has also been slashing health spending to fund the war in Ukraine, according to the UK's Ministry of Defence, external. 
""This mainly hits people in rural areas,"" says James Nixey of foreign affairs think tank Chatham House. ""The government makes cuts there rather than in the major cities, where they might cause uprisings.""

260,260,Ukraine: What happened on day 15 of Russia's invasion,"Thu, 10 Mar 2022 22:02:16 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-60697521,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-60697521?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,On the frontline in the battle for Kharkiv - and Ukrainians rescue their grandmothers from Russian shelling.,"Ukraine: What happened on day 15 of Russia's invasion
Kharkiv has been one of the focal points of the Russian attack
""We met only this afternoon, but already I know that just last week, his father Oleg was killed defending the city, and Lt Gromadsky is the seventh generation of military in his family. He plans for an eighth, in a free Ukraine.""
Russia's invasion of Ukraine has now entered its third week. What Russia's President, Vladimir Putin, surely intended to be a quick victory has stalled in the face of Ukrainian resistance.
Major urbans centres remain contested, with Ukraine's second largest city Kharkiv a flashpoint. 
Our reporter, Quentin Sommerville, has been embedded with Ukrainian forces.
Over a cup of borscht, he found men willing to fight but recognising they need more from the West if they are to win. 
""If Kharkiv falls, then all of Ukraine falls,"" one of them said. 
Death and despair in Mariupol
Ukrainian officials say three people including a child died in an attack on a children's hospital in Mariupol
A dire picture is emerging from the southern port city of Mariupol.
Reports say food and medicine are hard to find, and residents resorting to melting snow for water. And all this under an intense Russian bombardment. 
With the city encircled, residents of those trapped inside face the agonising uncertainty of trying to reach them by phone.
The BBC's Joel Gunter, who is in the Ukrainian city of Lviv, has been speaking to some of them.
""There is no possibility of private graves, because of the high numbers and because of the continuous shelling,"" one of them told him.  
""They are being put into mass graves.""
Dragging grandmother to safety 
A relieved Dmytro (R) poses here with (L-R) his sister, neighbour, grandmother and mother
Bucha is a small town just to the north-west of Kyiv. Much like in Mariupol, the shelling has been relentless, with residents forced to shelter in basements.
Dmytro, a 30-year-old lawyer, decided to escape. He was joined with his sister, his mother and his two grandmothers, aged 74 and 83.
Not long after they left, their grandmother could no longer walk so they needed to drag her to safety. 
""My granny begged us to leave her behind. She didn't want to be a burden for us but we didn't drop our loved ones.""
High-level talks but no breakthrough
Russia's Lavrov (R) in talks with Ukraine's Kuleba - but there was no immediate breakthrough
For the first time since Russia invaded Ukraine, the two sides have held high-level talks as Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba met Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov in Turkey.
The two agreed to continue discussions but apart from that there was nothing in the way of a substantial agreement.
They remain far apart. Lavrov repeated Russia's demands Ukraine disarm and adopt a neutral position, something Kuleba said amounted to wanting a surrender.

Abramovich sanctioned by UK
Roman Abramovich and Vladimir Putin pictured together at an event in Russia in 2016
As the fighting continued, individuals and companies linked to Russian President Vladimir Putin face more reprisals. 
The UK on Thursday sanctioned one of the best known oligarchs, Chelsea football club owner Roman Abramovich. 
His exact relationship with the Kremlin remains murky - some suggest he is merely tolerated by President Putin, others say the relationship is much closer than that.
Here's our guide to the mega-rich facing sanctions
Russia hits back
The sanctions against oligarchs are just one part of a long list of measures announced against Russia.
The US and UK are banning Russian oil imports, Russian banks have been shut out of international payment systems, and the central bank has had its assets frozen.
A swathe of major brands have pulled out of Russia. For Russians, whether super-rich or not, that means no Big Macs or watching Netflix.
Russia has now announced a series of counter measures, including export bans on a string of products such as agricultural equipment and telecoms. There's also a warning the assets of foreign companies could be seized.
But as our write-up says, the absence of raw materials among the banned list means the measures are more symbolic than significant.

BBC Sport answers some of the key questions.,"Roman Abramovich: What do Russian owner's sanctions mean for Chelsea?
Chelsea's next game at Stamford Bridge is on Sunday when Newcastle are the visitors in the Premier League
The future of European champions Chelsea is uncertain after sanctions were placed on Russian owner Roman Abramovich on Thursday.
The billionaire has been in charge since 2003 but had his attempts to sell the club halted by the UK government, which has frozen his assets.
What does it mean for Chelsea's fans, players and staff? BBC Sport explains how the situation will affect those associated with the club.
What exactly happened on Thursday?
This video can not be played
To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.
Nadine Dorries says her focus is to protect Chelsea FC, its fans and the ""national game""
Abramovich was sanctioned by the UK government as part of its response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
The government believes the billionaire has had a ""close relationship for decades"" with Russia's president Vladimir Putin, links Abramovich has always denied.
Watch: The Football News Show - Chelsea special
The Sports Desk: Life after Abramovich - what's next for Chelsea and English football?
Like the rest of his assets, Chelsea would have been frozen but a special licence granted by the government allows the Stamford Bridge club to keep operating.
Can Chelsea continue to play games?
Yes. 
The special licence issued by the government allows the men's and women's teams to fulfil their fixtures for the rest of this season as normal.
Chelsea's men won away at Norwich in the Premier League on Thursday while Chelsea's women were victorious at West Ham in the Women's Super League at the same time.
What does it mean for match-going fans?
Chelsea's club shop has closed after club owner Roman Abramovich was sanctioned by the UK government
Season-ticket holders will still be able to attend games at Stamford Bridge as normal, while match tickets sold before 10 March will be honoured.
But beyond that, supporters cannot buy any new tickets to watch Chelsea. 
Tickets were due to go on sale for the FA Cup quarter-final tie at Middlesbrough on 19 March but a post on the club's official website, external on Thursday confirmed that would no longer happen as planned.
The club is also unable to sell any merchandise, with the club shop at Stamford Bridge closing on Thursday morning.
Can Chelsea sell season tickets for next year? 
BBC senior sports news reporter Laura Scott: 
All the licence says is that anyone who purchased season tickets before 10 March, and makes payments in regular instalments, can ""continue to make those payments"". 
No mention has been made about future seasons.
Can Chelsea keep paying staff wages in the short and mid-terms?
The government's special licence allows Chelsea to pay the wages of all employees, including players and coaching staff.
The licence is in place until 31 May, so covers the Blues for the rest of the season and the Treasury has the right to vary, revoke or suspend it at any time.
Do these sanctions mean they cannot transfer players in or out?
Antonio Rudiger's future at Chelsea is uncertain with his contract expiring in the summer
While the sanctions are in place, Chelsea are effectively under a transfer ban and are unable to buy or sell players.
They are also unable to negotiate new contracts for the players they currently own, so leaves an uncertain future for those whose current deals expire in the summer.
That applies to Antonio Rudiger, Cesar Azpilicueta, and Andreas Christensen, although the latter two have been linked with a move to Barcelona. 
Rudiger was believed to be close to a new deal but current developments leave the defender in a limbo situation.
What about the future of Chelsea men and women head coaches?
BBC Sport's Simon Stone:
It's the same situation for both Thomas Tuchel and Emma Hayes - nobody has any idea how this will affect them yet. 
They have got contracts, no-one is saying they won't get paid. However, this is a time of great change. Does it make the club more vulnerable to an approach for either manager from a rival team? Things are likely to change significantly at the club. 
Tuchel said the future was uncertain, though he was happy to remain as manager when giving his reaction to Thursday's developments after Chelsea's game at Norwich later on the same day.
Thomas Tuchel and Emma Hayes coach the men's and women's teams respectively
BBC Sport's Emma Sanders: 
Hayes, who has been at the club for a decade, signed a long-term contract in July and had her eye on chasing a first Champions League title with Chelsea. 
She is extremely well supported within the club and has earned the respect from those high up, having won 10 major trophies during her time in charge.
Hayes was also among the exclusive list of trustees to whom Abramovich attempted to give 'stewardship' of Chelsea at the end of last month. Her commitment to the club has never been questioned so fans will no doubt be monitoring the situation cautiously.

The Football News Show: What do sanctions mean for the sale of Chelsea?
Can Chelsea still be sold?
BBC Sport's Alistair Magowan: 
Chelsea were put up for sale on 2 March and there are understood to be plenty of interested parties, despite Abramovich being sanctioned.
The UK government is open to considering a further addition to the special licence to allow a sale to proceed.
Those working on the deal on behalf of Abramovich were always told that proceeds from the sale would go to a fund for victims of the war in Ukraine.
This was made clear when Abramovich put the club up for sale last week. It is understood that the £1.5bn loan from Abramovich will not be deducted from the price.
Abramovich had instructed American investment firm Raine Group to seek £3bn for the club, but finance experts believe that an already inflated price could drop further given the current uncertainty around Chelsea.
Raine Group has temporarily halted the sale process while it seeks answers from the government.
How quickly the club can be sold once a buyer has been found depends on the government receiving assurances that the proceeds would not go to Abramovich, but securing those assurances could take time.
What about Chelsea's participation in European competition? 
Chelsea's men's side won the Champions League last season while the women's team were runners-up
BBC senior sports news reporter Laura Scott: 
All we've had from Uefa at this stage is that it is ""seeking further clarification on the matter"" before it comments further. 
What Uefa is presumably trying to establish is what happens if Chelsea make it through to the quarter-finals of the Champions League, and can't sell any tickets.  
If Chelsea get to the FA Cup semi-finals, will their section of the ground be empty?
Chelsea's men's side are away to Championship side Middlesbrough in the quarter-finals on 19 March (17:15 GMT), which will be shown live on BBC One. 
If they win that then they will play at Wembley in the semi-finals on the weekend 16-17 April.
It is unclear at this stage how the the restrictions would impact FA Cup ticket sales if they progressed to Wembley.
Can Chelsea afford away travel, given the government budget?
BBC senior sports news reporter Laura Scott: 
The government has set a limit of £20,000 per team per match for travel to and from matches. 
BBC Sport understands the club considers the £20,000 cap to be too low to allow it to operate normally, and this is a pressing matter given next week the men's team travel to Lille in the Champions League.
How much are Chelsea's sponsors worth and how have they reacted?
Within hours of the announcement that Abramovich had been sanctioned by the UK government, Chelsea' main shirt sponsors suspended their £40m-a-year deal with the club.
Mobile network provider Three had been Chelsea's official partner since 2020.
It is unclear whether any of Chelsea's other sponsorship deals are at risk at this stage.
In 2016, the London club signed a new kit deal with US sportswear giants Nike. At the time it was reported to be worth £60m a season for the next 15 years, but the club did not confirm any cash figures.
In May 2021, Chelsea named global hotel search platform Trivago as the club's official training wear partner in a multi-year partnership.
Chelsea also have a number of other official partners.
Could Chelsea go into administration?
If Chelsea are unable to pay their bills they could go into administration and face a nine-point deduction.
Financial journalist Kieran Maguire: 
In the short term, it's to a large extent business as usual. Chelsea will be able to pay wages due at the end of March and will have other overheads.
Chelsea's wage bill is round about £28m a month. We don't know how much cash they have in the bank. The most recent accounts we have are from June 2021 when there was £16m in the bank. Abramovich has been injecting money into Chelsea on a regular basis over recent years and presumably that won't be able to continue.
The concern might be what happens if Chelsea's cash reserves are insufficient to pay their wage bill - but presumably the government and Premier League, who have been working on this, will have been looking at it to try to minimise disruption on a club level.

264,264,What is a thermobaric or vacuum bomb?,"Thu, 10 Mar 2022 11:34:56 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-60571395,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-60571395?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,"What is a thermobaric or vacuum bomb, and why is Russia using them in the war in Ukraine?","What is a thermobaric or vacuum bomb?
Russia's TOS-1A thermobaric rocket launchers at a defence exhibition in Moscow last year
Russia has used thermobaric weapons - also known as vacuum bombs - in Ukraine, says the UK's Ministry of Defence (MoD). 
Thermobaric weapons are controversial because they are much more devastating than conventional explosives of similar size, and have a terrible impact on anyone caught in their blast radius. 
Has Russia used thermobaric weapons in Ukraine?
In a tweet, the MoD said that Russia had confirmed the use of the TOS-1A weapon system in Ukraine, external.
It said: ""The TOS-1A uses thermobaric rockets, creating incendiary and blast effects."" The Russian military calls the units ""heavy flamethrowers"", external, which can fire rockets up to 9km.
Ukraine's ambassador to the US, Oksana Markarova, has also accused Russia of using them in its invasion.
How does a thermobaric bomb work?
A thermobaric bomb (also called a vacuum or aerosol bomb - or fuel air explosive) consists of a fuel container with two separate explosive charges. 
This can be launched as a rocket or dropped as a bomb from aircraft. When it hits its target, the first explosive charge opens the container and widely scatters fuel mixture as a cloud. 
This cloud can penetrate any building openings or defences that are not totally sealed. 
A second charge then detonates the cloud, resulting in a huge fireball, a massive blast wave and a vacuum which sucks up all surrounding oxygen. The weapon can destroy reinforced buildings, equipment and kill or injure people. 
They are used for a variety of purposes and come in a range of sizes - including weapons for use by individual soldiers such as grenades and hand-held rocket launchers. 
Huge air-launched versions have also been designed, specifically to kill defenders in caves and tunnel complexes - the effects of this weapon are at their most severe in enclosed spaces.
In 2003, the US tested a 9,800kg bomb, nicknamed the ""Mother of all bombs"". Four years later, Russia developed a similar device, the Father of all bombs"", external. This created an explosion equivalent to a 44-tonne conventional bomb - making it the biggest non-nuclear explosive device in the world.
Given their devastating impact, and their usefulness against defenders who are dug in to buildings or bunkers, thermobaric bombs have mainly been used in urban environments.
This is significant given developments on the ground in Ukraine, where Russian forces are trying to take control of the capital, Kyiv, and other main cities in the east of the country.
What are the rules of war for thermobaric bombs?
There are no international laws specifically banning their use, but if a country uses them to target civilian populations in built-up areas, schools or hospitals, then it could be convicted of a war crime under the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907, external.
International Criminal Court prosecutor Karim Khan has said his court will investigate possible war crimes in Ukraine, external.
Where have they been used before?
Thermobaric munitions can be traced back to World War Two, when they were initially used by the German army. They were not widely developed until the 1960s, when the US used them in Vietnam. 
US forces used thermobaric bombs in Afghanistan
The US also used them in Afghanistan. First, in 2001 to try to destroy al-Qaeda forces hiding in the caves of the Tora Bora mountains, external, and in 2017, against Islamic State forces. 
Russia used them in its war in Chechnya in 1999, external and was condemned by Human Rights Watch for doing so. 
Russian-made thermobaric weapons were reportedly used in the Syrian civil war, external by the regime of Bashar al-Assad.

Most papers are leading with the UK's latest sanctions on Russian oligarchs - especially those facing Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich. 
The Daily Express, external calls it ""The fall of Roman's Empire"" - a fall the Daily Star, external describes as ""inevitable."" The Daily Mirror, external pictures Mr Abramovich and Russian President Vladimir Putin against a backdrop showing a victim of the war, with the headline ""Blood Brothers."" 
The Daily Mail, external welcomes the crackdown, saying ""Abramovich's dirty billions"" have been ""frozen at last"" and the Guardian, external questions why nothing has happened before now. The i suggests, external the billionaire could move to China, while the Financial Times, external reports wealthy Russians are flocking to the United Arab Emirates to avoid Western sanctions.
There is concern about the future of Chelsea as a football club, with the Sun warning, external it faces going bust - which the Mail thinks , externalis a real possibility unless a sale takes place within months. 
A senior source at Chelsea tells the Times, external that if the club cannot operate normally, it will quickly begin to lose money and rack up debts.
The Mail echoes, external the UN's claims that Europe is facing its biggest refugee crisis since the end of World War Two, with two million more people expected to flee Ukraine in the coming days. The Daily Telegraph, external says ministers will announce a hotline and webpage where the public, charities and businesses will be invited to offer refugees somewhere to stay.
The Times suggests, external the scheme has been delayed because of disagreements over the details, including which benefits the refugees could claim and how safeguarding checks will be carried out.
The Telegraph reports, external that Russian state television has broadcast calls for Mr Putin to stop the war. Pundits likened the conflict to Afghanistan - while a serving army officer is said to have explained on a channel run by the country's Ministry of Defence that Russian soldiers were dying in Ukraine.
In its leader column, the Times examines, external the threat of Russia using chemical weapons. The editorial says there can be ""little doubt"" that President Putin could adopt them. The paper says their deployment would raise the stakes for the West and intensify calls for a no-fly zone - calls the Times suggests should not be heeded.

The Express says, external that experts around the world are monitoring cases of a new Covid variant called Deltacron - a suspected combination of both Delta and Omicron variants. 
According to the Times, external, cases of Covid 19 are now rising in every age group and region of England. But the Mail stresses , externalthat figures suggest that the virus is proving less deadly than flu. 
The i reports that GPs and hospitals have been told to ""crack on"" with giving a fourth Covid vaccine to the over 75s and the vulnerable at the end of this month.
Meanwhile, the Telegraph, external notes that Britain's pandemic death rate is considered to better than previously thought - roughly in the middle compared with other countries.
And many of the papers report on the second child of the Tesla chief executive Elon Musk with the singer Grimes - a baby that the Mail, external says was a secret. 
The game was given away, explains the i, when the girl began crying unexpectedly during an interview. The Express , external says her name is Exa Dark Siderael, but is nicknamed Y, coming after her brother, X.

Before the auction, Mr Hobbs had expected the lot to sell for more than £10,000 but said ""these things are impossible to value""
A piece of artwork from the cover of a classic Queen album has been sold at auction for more than £28,000.
The piece, designed by David Costa, and from the 1976 album A Day at the Races, was sold by Gardiner Houlgate in Corsham on Wednesday.
Auctioneer Luke Hobbs said the piece was ""probably, for me personally, the most exciting piece I've ever had in, just because of the connection with the band and what it is"".
An American buyer purchased the piece.
Describing the quality of the work guitar specialist Mr Hobbs said: ""Our art expert here had a look at it and said it's one of the finest 20th Century art pieces he's ever looked at.""
The piece was by David Costa who was the art director for both A Night at the Opera and A Day at the Races.
In 2021, the original artwork for another Queen album, 1977's News Of The World sold in New York for $62,575 (£46,000).
The artwork design came from an original sketch by Freddie Mercury
Mr Hobbs said when he was researching the lot ""[David] gave it to me initially thinking it was A Night at the Opera [and] I turned round and said 'it's not, it's A Day at the Races'.
He said when he asked if he still had the opera artwork, Mr Costa said: ""'Oh no, well I've got no idea where it is, I think A Night at the Opera may have have become a night in the dustbin' and that was his exact quote to me.""
Mr Hobbs said the piece is valuable because of the quality and ""there's only one of them"".
He added: ""It's not just a Queen cover, it's a piece of art that was used and became one of [the bands] most iconic albums really,"" he added.
A Day At The Races was released in 1976 and went platinum, reaching number one in the UK album chart as well as in Japan and the Netherlands. It contained the hit singles Somebody To Love and Tie Your Mother Down.

""Gracie was let down by the police, definitely""
The parents of a young woman who was killed by her stalker believe she would still be alive if police had ""done their job properly"".
Six weeks before Gracie Spinks was stabbed to death in June 2021, two walkers found a bag of weapons near the scene and gave it to police.
Her parents have now been told the bag contained a shop receipt that linked back to killer Michael Sellers.
Derbyshire Police told the BBC they could not comment on this.
This is due to an ongoing investigation by the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC), which has served a gross misconduct notice, external on a police sergeant and misconduct notices on two constables in relation to what police did with the bag.
""It was a very, very sinister bag of weapons, including Rambo-style knives, axe, blades, Viagra, a note, and they just logged it as lost property,"" said Gracie's mother Alison Heaton.
""We now know that bag directly led straight back to Michael Sellers. There was a receipt in there that led back to his household.""
Mrs Heaton said they had been told about the receipt - which had card payment details printed on it - by police.
""They traced it back to that house after her death. It should have been traced back to that household back on 6 May [when the bag was found],"" she said.
Gracie's mother described the bag of weapons as ""very sinister""
By that point Gracie had already complained to police about Sellers stalking her, after she saw him waiting at the stables in Duckmanton where she kept her horse.
This was the same area where the bag of weapons was found, and where she was killed.
""Surely basic policing and training would show you that is a bag of weapons [belonging to someone] about to commit a murder?"" said Gracie's father, Richard Spinks.
""If they had done their job properly, Gracie would still be alive today.""
Misconduct notices have also been served on a separate police sergeant and constable, external concerning how the investigation into Gracie's stalking complaint was handled.
Gracie was murdered after going to look after her horse Paddy at stables in Duckmanton
An inquest which opened into Gracie's death heard she died from a stab wound to the neck on 18 June 2021, after going to look after her horse Paddy in Duckmanton.
Sellers, who was 35, is thought to have killed Gracie before running away and killing himself in another field.
Gracie met Sellers when she started working at Xbite, an e-commerce company in Chesterfield, in April 2020.
She had been working as a lifeguard but was furloughed because of the pandemic.
Sellers was Gracie's supervisor and became ""infatuated"" with her, her mother said.
'Pestered'
Gracie agreed to go for a meal with Sellers but her mother said she was not interested in a relationship.
""Because he was her supervisor she was a bit anxious and nervous about how to tell him to go away,"" said her father.
""He pestered her with messages and phone calls; obviously she blocked him in the end.
""He was constantly asking [work colleagues] 'what's Gracie doing, where is she?'""
Michael Sellers is thought to have killed Gracie before running away and killing himself
In early 2021 Gracie saw Sellers waiting for her near the Duckmanton stables.
He was waiting in a white VW Scirocco car, which he bought after Gracie told him she liked her brother's Scirocco.
Gracie's father said this ""spooked her even more"".
""The fact he had bought it and the fact he was there that morning waiting for her,"" he said.
""He knew all her movements you see, it was definitely stalking.""
'Alarm bells'
Gracie then reported Sellers to Xbite, who suspended him and advised Gracie to report him to police.
Gracie's mother said two female police officers came to their house in Old Whittington and took a statement.
""They left that evening saying they were going to go to his home address and tell him to leave her alone,"" she said.
""The police have since told us that they did go to his address and he said he was in a relationship with Gracie, which to us flags alarm bells even more.
""If that's what he's telling the police and Gracie's saying something completely different, there's clearly a problem.""
Richard Spinks believed his daughter would still be alive if she had been warned about the bag of weapons
Gracie's parents said, following the sighting of Sellers, they did not let her go back to the stables on her own for weeks.
If they had known about the bag of weapons, they said they would not have let her go there on her own again.
The bag was found by Anna White and her partner Wayne Kipling.
""When we took everything out the bag and saw the note that said 'don't lie', it was obvious that it was going to be used to kill someone.
""That's what I thought, so that's why I rang the police,"" said Ms White.
""I asked what was going to be done with it and they said it would probably just go to lost property. I was just gobsmacked.""
By coincidence, her daughter also works at Xbite.
She said Sellers was known as ""creepy Mike"". 
""He must have been a certain way with the girls, I think, and that's what they called him,"" she said.
Wayne Kipling and Anna White found the bag of weapons near the scene where Gracie was later murdered
Gracie's parents believe police should have spoken to staff at Xbite, where other women had reportedly made complaints about Sellers.
They are now supporting a campaign for Gracie's Law, which asks the government to fund stalking advocates for police forces.
""I don't think they [police] get enough training in stalking or understand it fully, and that's what needs to be addressed as well,"" said Mr Spinks.
""We don't want this to happen to anybody else.""
Derbyshire Police has announced it is to appoint a stalking coordinator.
In a statement, the force said: ""We continue to support and fully cooperate with the IOPC investigation into the circumstances leading up to the tragic death of Gracie.
""We are keeping the IOPC up to date with a number of improvements we have implemented in recent months and we would encourage all victims of stalking and harassment to report incidents to us for investigation.
""We're unable to comment further at this time due to the ongoing IOPC investigation.""
An IOPC spokesperson said: ""We have completed our investigative steps into the actions of Derbyshire Constabulary in the months leading up to the death of Gracie Spinks in Duckmanton in June last year and are now compiling our final investigation report.
""We have kept Gracie's family, the coroner, and Derbyshire Constabulary updated during the course of our investigation.
""At its conclusion we will decide whether any of the five officers we have served notices on may have a disciplinary case to answer.
""We are also considering whether any learning has arisen for Derbyshire Constabulary from their contact with Gracie prior to her tragic death.""

273,273,Climate change: Can the Russian energy crisis help to curb global heating?,"Fri, 11 Mar 2022 01:59:25 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-60683929,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-60683929?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,"An energy strategy is due - but can it get the UK off Russian gas, cut bills and help the environment?","Climate change: Can the Russian energy crisis help to curb global heating?
Can the government wean Britain off Russian gas while also keeping energy affordable and hitting its climate change targets?
Boris Johnson has pledged to produce an energy strategy shortly that does all three things. 
Can he pull it off and what are the political hurdles he faces?
Some journalists have been briefed that the PM may encourage further research into fracking - where rocks are cracked underground to release gas.
But otherwise the launch will offer no radically new policy - rather, an acceleration of existing plans. 
One thing is clear - there will be no new coal-fired power stations.
But Mr Johnson is being tugged in two directions as he deliberates. 
Calls for urgent help over rising household bills
Charities warn fuel poverty could double in a year
Warning UK faces biggest income squeeze in 50 years
The business department (BEIS), and most experts, tell him existing plans to cut fossil fuels to protect the climate will help shield the UK from rocketing global prices for oil and gas.  
They want government support for home insulation to reduce demand for gas heating. They say alternatives, such as electric heat pumps, should be rapidly deployed. And they want much faster deployment of renewables and nuclear. 
Conservative commentators share the desire for new nuclear, but insist that the UK should also resume fracking to shield the UK from fuel price rises.
The PM is looking to announce plans from the short term to the long term. 
Instant cheap - or even free - results, for instance, can be gained by cutting our use of gas and oil.  
Big questions are being asked about the future role of nuclear energy
The International Energy Agency, external urges everyone to turn down the thermostat by a degree - that could save up to 10% of heating energy (and costs), it says.
Insulation is another no-brainer quick hit - and it makes your home more comfortable. Even a draught excluder ""sausage"" for a door makes a small difference, as does basic draught-proofing. Heating only the rooms you're using is an easy hit.
A speed limit of 55mph - the most efficient running speed for many cars - could be set during the energy crisis to cut carbon emissions. That might be resisted by a libertarian PM and in any case the RAC Foundation said it would be more effective to make fewer trips, and to brake and accelerate more smoothly.
Trains could reduce their top speed and services could be reduced to prevent empty running. 
The public might accept the restrictions if they were persuaded of an urgent need. 
Some analysts want the government to phase out the sale of new gas boilers and hobs rapidly. Boilers running on imported gas would be replaced by electric heat pumps powered by electricity generated by British wind farms.
That would immediately cut demand but it would require a challenging increase in heat pump installations when there are too few installers and a poor supply chain. 
Others want a government energy savings campaign like the one employed to tackle the oil crisis in 1970s with cheeky slogans like ""Save energy - bath with a friend"". 
Tremors and house prices
What about the medium term?  
This is where the fracking debate comes into play. When fracking began in the UK there were high hopes Britain could emulate the cheap energy boom in the United States. 
But there were problems. The operators couldn't predict the effects of the fracking process, and neighbours complained about minor earth tremors and house prices.  What's more, geologists started to raise doubts - not about the quantity of shale gas in the UK, but about our potential ability to get it out of the ground.
Then economists warned that any fracked gas would be sold on to the global market so it wouldn't lower UK prices much anyway. 
Former head of the gas giant Centrica, Iain Conn - previously a shale fan - told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""I don't think it is possible to drill enough wells to be able to make a material difference to the UK supplies.""
FM: North Sea oil not solution to Russian reliance
PM promises energy plan as Russia gas fears grow
Could the world survive without Russian oil and gas?
In 2019 the government put a moratorium on fracking, which a No10 statement said would last until firms could ensure shale gas can be obtained without significant tremors. That's the official line - but a Downing Street spokesman said nothing had been ruled out.
The PM could, hypothetically, announce an inquiry which might or might not find in favour of fracking - but would at least relieve political pressure from some of his backbenchers.
Wind energy also lies in the medium term. Onshore wind power is cheap and consistently polls show it's liked by the general public. That hasn't stopped some newspapers labelling them ""hated"" wind farms.
The government previously responded to pressure from local objectors and imposed rules which effectively allow just one protester to kill a project. 
A lot of UK houses are poorly insulated
Operators say they need these rules changed.
Offshore wind farms take up to 20 years to develop at the moment. But the operators say new turbines could be spinning within just two years if the government gives more resources to the cash-strapped authorities that grant consent.
Then offshore oil and gas operations are a medium to long-term bet. They take an average of 28 years to start production, but these too, could be fast-tracked. 
There's no fossil fuel bonanza left in the North Sea. Many stocks are exhausted, and all produce will be sold at world prices anyway. But ministers decided before Vladimir Putin's war that it was better to get UK gas with UK jobs and taxes than foreign gas liquified, with more impact on the environment.
This was controversial: the International Energy Agency wants to halt all new fossil fuel operations because enough has been found already to wreck the climate.  
What about the long term? 
The same MPs who are demanding fracking also support new nuclear power stations - but these would be expected to take decades to build, and the current incident at the Chernobyl reactor in Ukraine won't make the consenting process any easier.  
Some environmentalists also support nuclear power to cover for renewables when the wind isn't blowing.
But the government hasn't embraced it until recently because of public fears, the absence of waste storage and - importantly - the cost. Nuclear comes in at around £90 per megawatt hour, while new offshore wind is around half that. 
But after decades of dither from Tories and Labour, the wind is clearly blowing nuclear's way. And Mr Johnson will offer a renewed push for Sizewell C and a boost for mini-reactors. Nuclear enthusiasts say the UK needs a whole raft of new nukes to play a significant part in the energy mix. 
Would motorway users accept a 55mph speed limit if it benefited the environment?
It is potentially a critical moment in the UK's energy history. 
The government has been criticised for failing to live up to its promises on climate change, but Mr Putin's missiles may have turbo-charged plans to improve achieving energy security while cutting emissions.
Labour has seized the moment by demanding what it calls an energy sprint - ramping up renewables and nuclear.
It says insulating 19 million homes over a decade would cut UK gas imports by 15% and save up to £400 off the average energy bill. 
Fracking halted after government pulls support
UK commits to 'net zero' emissions by 2050
Will the government pay you to go green?
Chancellor Rishi Sunak has so far declined to commit to a major long-term home renovation and energy efficiency strategy that could keep down bills.
Labour believes progress has been delayed because the government feels the breath of climate sceptics over its shoulder.  
The Lib Dems and Greens have long demanded tougher action towards energy-saving and low-carbon domestic electricity. 
So fracking may grab the headlines in the PM's forthcoming speech. 
But the real test will be whether at last the government is willing to invest the cash and the policies to deliver its climate targets, hold down bills and protect us from Mr Putin's war.

Former punk-rocker Cato Syversen was happy to become a DJ during the pandemic to keep staff engaged
Cato Syversen runs a sober and serious business, providing credit ratings information.
But to keep the 1,300 staff at his firm Creditsafe amused and engaged during the pandemic he revealed his lighter side.
Working from home during Covid spurred the company to buy software that allowed staff to run their own media operation.
Mr Syversen joined in with a stint as a DJ and also donned a false moustache and suit to play Ron Burgundy, the title character from the movie, Anchorman.
The Norwegian finance executive has embraced these challenges. ""I'm an old punk rocker. I wanted to be a rock star, this is a good second.""
When Mr Syversen turned to LiveTiles, software that allows a workforce to build their own videos and podcasts together online, he knew what he did not want to see. 
""I did not want a company intranet because in my experience they are boring."" 
According to him, Creditsafe's employees leapt at the chance to be creative and break the monotony of working from home be creating their own news desk, including Mr Syversen's Anchorman impression, and Safe FM, an internal radio station with studio guests and podcasts. 
Cato Syversen as Ron Burgundy from the movie Anchorman
The videos contain footage of work Christmas parties in Italy or Sweden, tips to beat the January blues, advice and insights from colleagues. And it can get very personal, with staff paying respects to deceased colleagues. 
Mr Syversen had wanted to get this kind of informal network up and running before the pandemic, but he discovered that dedicated software was the missing ingredient. ""We had something we made ourselves and it was rubbish!""
His first reaction to the pandemic scattering his workforce back to their homes, was to email a daily newsletter around the company. But that didn't strike the right, informal note he was looking for. Freeing up his staff to do their own thing has worked, he insists. 
""Things like seeing the faces of people in other countries, it's not easy to get that sense of belonging. Normally we have a big party every five years, everyone gets together, but not this time."" 
Creditsafe's staff have risen to the opportunity he says. ""I like the way they pay attention and share things, like tips on how to use the features of Teams."" 
Gothenburg-based employee, Camilla Emring puts it like this: ""I feel people open their hearts up more than they would in the queue at the coffee machine.""
Creditsafe employee Camilla Emring thinks new software has brought staff closer together
Bringing some lightness to the workplace is probably not a bad idea. But how does an employer find out if their efforts are making any difference?
One way to test the water is to use software that canvasses staff sentiment.
Sarah Marrs is an occupational psychologist with Qualtrics. She ensures that the right questions are posed to employees to gauge their true feelings. 
Employees of a business using Qualtrics's software see a series of statements such as ""I feel as if I belong at this company"" and rate their level of agreement or disagreement with it. These responses are fed into a dashboard, lighting up indicators of a workforce's emotional state.

The company says that more businesses were monitoring how employee sentiment shifted during lockdowns, with tools like surveys, because unhappy staff were voting with their feet. 
This exodus has been tagged as the Great Resignation by some, with some parts of the workforce reassessing their values and shifting to completely different careers and others retiring early.
A global survey of 14,000 employees, external by Qualtrics indicated that 35% have plans to move jobs this year. 
However, not everyone sees this online interaction as a positive. Bogdan Costea left his native Romania to attend a conference at Lancaster University in the UK in 1992 and never left. He found a niche at the university, studying the nature of work and is now a Professor of Management and Society.
Professor Bogdan Costea is not convinced that collecting data on staff sentiment helps
Professor Costea thinks that feedback from a workforce is not the treasure trove that some view it as. ""We have become enthralled by data, as if the more we collect, the more truth comes out. So, there are so many software packages that gauge employee sentiment and claim to allow individual expressions of opinion.""
However, he warns that this kind of employee canvassing can lure individuals into a sense that they need to justify their own role. 
""After the first three months of working from home during the pandemic, people began to overwork because they wanted to prove they were doing their job. Asking them to talk about how they feel can be dangerous because they may be reluctant to admit their vulnerabilities,"" he says.
Andrew Pakes, deputy general secretary of professional workers union, Prospect, also has concerns and believes staff may worry about being judged.
""Is there a league table? Can an employer use this technology to see the ten least engaged workers? What will that mean for them?""
Prospect is not opposed to this raft of opinion-seeking software, but fears that hitting icons on a screen is no real substitute for human judgement.
""We'd like to see mental health becoming more central to management, not delegated to external products.""
Sarah Marrs from analytics firm Qualtrics says bosses take staff feedback seriously
Back at Qualtrics, Ms Marrs understands these concerns but adds that from her experience it's important to remember that senior executives also have feelings invested in the feedback process. ""Board members and chief executives take feedback very personally."" 
So, if anyone should be able to answer the question of whether your boss really cares what you think, Ms Marrs should. She pauses before replying. ""I want to say 'yes', obviously, but the truth is that your employer cares about the bottom line. And, at the moment, employees have the power to stay or leave.""

A virtual gallery to showcase Mali's cultural history has been launched, featuring tens of thousands of Timbuktu's ancient manuscripts.
The manuscripts were smuggled to safety from Timbuktu after Islamist militant groups took control of the city in northern Mali in 2012. 
They contain centuries of African knowledge and scholarship on topics ranging from maths to astrological charts.
""Central to the heritage of Mali, they represent the long legacy of written knowledge and academic excellence in Africa,"" said Dr Abdel Kader Haidara, a librarian known for smuggling the manuscripts out of Timbuktu, who was also involved in the project.
The collection, called Mali Magic, external, also captures Malian culture beyond the manuscripts. It was put together by Google, along with local and international partners.
It features a picture of the dance of the Dogon ethnic group. It also showcases art, such as that of award-winning Abdoulaye Konaté, and an image of builders plastering the Great Mosque of Djenné, a Unesco world heritage site about 500km (310 miles) south of Timbuktu.
The ancient documents were originally written in medieval Arabic but have now been translated to English, French, Spanish and modern Arabic to make them more accessible, which Google Program Manager and Digital Archaeologist Chance Coughenour told the BBC was a first.
""Making a digital record and copy of the manuscripts is very important and for the first time we're bringing the fruits of our labour after so many years,"" he said.
For centuries Timbuktu was a cultural hub on the African continent, as well as an Islamic centre of learning. The city's mosques played a critical role in the spread of Islam throughout West Africa in the 15th and 16th Centuries, according to Unesco., external
Over the last seven years Mali's traditional leaders, historians and digital archaeologists have been hard at work to make sure that the ancient manuscripts, some dating back to the 11th Century, containing the country's rich history are preserved by digitising them. 
The project presents an opportunity for people to learn from those who came before them, said Dr Haidara (below).
The digitising of these manuscripts began with a call to Google by Dr Haidara in 2014. 
He invited the company to visit Mali to see the renowned manuscripts of Timbuktu and to learn the story of why they were at risk. 
On arrival they found texts which included early Qurans and some with diverse topics including astronomy, maths and geography. 
The team then had the task of not only going through hundreds of pages to make a digital record of these but to make them visually appealing online. 
Up to 40,000 pages will now be available online, covering topics from biology to music. 
It is a project the people of Mali have kept their eyes on for many years since Islamist militants set fire to libraries in Timbuktu as they tried to destroy the priceless papers. 
Over a period of six months, manuscripts were smuggled out of Timbuktu to Mali's capital Bamako, as time was running out to rescue and preserve the documents from near destruction. 
In 2016 an alleged member of an Islamist group, Ahmad Al Faqi Al Mahdi, was found guilty of intentionally ordering attacks on religious and historic building, external in Timbuktu by the International Criminal Court (ICC). He was sentenced to nine years in jail and apologised. 
It was the first time that the court in The Hague had tried a case of cultural destruction.
This project to preserve Mali's manuscripts is not however the first attempt. The University of Cape Town launched the Tombouctou Manuscripts Project in 2003, with an emphasis on ""manuscript traditions throughout the African continent"", according to the website. , external
Similarly, the US Library of Congress has made some of the manuscripts available online. , external

276,276,Ukraine war: How reliant is the world on Russia for oil and gas?,"Thu, 10 Mar 2022 11:22:57 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/58888451,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/58888451?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,Russia has threatened to cut off gas supplies if countries ban its oil.,"Russia sanctions: What impact have they had on its oil and gas exports?
Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, many countries have pledged to end or restrict their oil and gas imports to curtail Moscow's revenues and hinder its war effort.
The Russian economy is highly dependent on its energy sector, and Europe is a major importer of Russian energy, making cutting back difficult.
What sanctions are in place?
EU nations have ended imports of Russian oil brought in by sea, and a ban on refined oil products will come in from 5 February. 
The United States said last March it would stop importing Russian oil, and the UK said it was banning Russian crude oil and refined products with effect from 5 December, external. 
European countries have sought to reduce their dependence on Russian gas
An oil price cap approved by Western allies in December also aims to prevent Russia getting more than $60 (£48) for a barrel of crude oil.
Russia's gas sector has also been targeted. The EU said in March it would cut gas imports from Russia by two-thirds within a year. The UK, which only imported small quantities of Russian gas, it has now ended this altogether.
Have the sanctions been effective?
Urals oil is currently being exported from Russia's north western sea port of Primorsk for around $40 per barrel, from where it has largely gone to European destinations.
The value of Russian oil from other ports and pipelines varies, but the Urals price has fallen across the board since the EU banned imports of Russian oil by sea.
The price cap on Russian oil was agreed by the world's major economies at the same time. But energy analyst Ben McWilliams believes it is the EU oil embargo impacting the price, rather than the price cap. 
""Russian oil is being traded at around $50 (£40) per barrel. That has been driven by the embargo because Russia now has to try to sell elsewhere.""
Moscow is losing out on about $175m (£140m) a day from fossil fuel exports due to these measures, according to a study by the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA)., external
India is taking advantage of cheaper oil imported from Russia
Major Russian banks have also been removed from the international financial messaging system Swift.
Countries continuing to trade with Russia have sought ways around this. Both China and India are increasingly making their oil and gas purchases in their local currencies.
Who is buying Russian oil?
India, China and Turkey all ramped up their purchases of Russian oil last year - and together they now make up 70% of all Russian crude flows by sea.
And Russia was offering its oil at a significantly lower price than the global benchmark Brent crude. 
At the start of 2022, Russia supplied less than 2% of India's oil imports, but it is now on course to become its largest single supplier.
China's imports of Russian oil have fluctuated, but have also risen over the past year.
In 2021, more than half of all Russia's crude oil exports, external went to countries in Europe. But in 2022, UK imports of oil from Russia fell sharply and other European countries have cut back too. 
But some have remained heavily reliant, such as the Slovak Republic and Hungary.
European countries have been looking to see if they can source supplies elsewhere.
The International Energy Agency (IEA) club of oil importing countries agreed to release 120m barrels of crude from their stocks in 2022. The US also released some of its strategic reserves last year.
But calls for oil-rich nations such as Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Venezuela to increase production have not been successful.
Opec and other major oil producers cut production in late 2022 to sustain prices.
Europe still relies on Russian gas
Reducing gas imports from Russia has been a major challenge for many European countries, as the continent has been getting most of its gas through pipelines linked to Russia.
In 2021, Russia was supplying EU countries with 40% of their natural gas, with Germany the largest importer, followed by Italy and the Netherlands. That had dropped to around 17% by August 2022, according to EU figures., external
In 2021, the UK got just 4% of its gas supply from Russian. It now imports none.
EU states are increasingly looking to ship in liquefied natural gas, external (LNG) in tankers from producers such as the US and Qatar.

The shift towards LNG imports by European countries has been very significant, replacing supplies from Russia.
However, ""there aren't enough LNG terminals in Europe"", says energy advisor Kate Dourian. ""This will be a problem for Germany, particularly."" 
There are several new LNG terminals planned and some already under construction across Europe as countries try to boost their capacity.

Manager Thomas Tuchel expresses hope for Chelsea in light of sanctions
Thomas Tuchel says Chelsea face an uncertain future but has promised the team will keep competing on the pitch.
Chelsea won 3-1 at Norwich hours after owner Roman Abramovich was sanctioned by the UK government.
""As long as we have enough shirts and a bus to drive to the games, we'll be there and will compete hard,"" boss Tuchel told BBC Radio 5 Live.
""We take it day by day. I didn't see that coming yesterday and I don't know what is coming tomorrow.""

Chelsea fans chanted Abramovich's name during the victory at bottom club Norwich which strengthened the club's grip on third place in the Premier League table.
Tuchel said the the off-field developments had proved ""another level of distraction"".
The German added: ""Of course the subject is there, the talks are going on, so there is a certain distraction. The level of impact it has - the news of today is big - in time we don't know how big. 
""We cannot influence it.""
Chelsea's women's team were also in action at the same time as Tuchel's side.
They won 4-1 at West Ham in the Women's Super League and boss Emma Hayes said: ""I can't get too wrapped up in it when there's a war going on in Ukraine. 
""We are Chelsea and we will prevail. There will be solutions, we just need to be patient.""

'I am happy to be manager of a strong team'
Tuchel also said he is ""still happy"" to be manager of the club after Abramovich was sanctioned.
Russian Abramovich has had his assets frozen following his country's invasion of Ukraine and his sale of the club has been halted.
The move is intended to stop Abramovich making money from Chelsea.
""I'm not sure I am concerned, but I am aware of it,"" added Tuchel.
""It changes almost every day. I am still happy to be here and still happy to be manager of a strong team. I know there is a lot of noise around.""
Tuchel's side played Dean Smith's Norwich City on the day the UK government sanctioned Abramovich
Tuchel was appointed Chelsea manager in January 2021 and led the club to victory in the Champions League last season.
He added: ""It is quite a big change from yesterday to today but we can't influence it, we didn't cause the situation. 
""In the moment, it seems that business, let's say football-wise, is more or less protected, but let's see.
""I feel privileged to have the chance to be involved in games, coaching and football that I love."" 
Reaction and analysis to Abramovich's sale of Chelsea being halted
Abramovich had put the European champions up for sale on 2 March after the threat of sanctions was raised in Parliament.
The introduction of sanctions eight days later means Chelsea cannot sell further match tickets, although the government has issued a special licence that will allow the club to fulfil its fixtures, staff to be paid and existing ticket-holders to attend matches.
However, Chelsea's shirt sponsor, telecommunications company Three, has requested to ""temporarily suspend"" its deal with the club.
The club will be unable to buy or sell players, or offer new contracts, while the sanctions are imposed on Abramovich. Chelsea-owned players on loan at other teams will be able to continue to play for those clubs.
The London side's merchandise shop has also been shut.
Chelsea have said they ""intend to engage in discussions"" with the government and will seek amendments to the special licence to ""allow the club to operate as normal as possible"".
The government is open to considering a further addition to the special licence which will allow the sale of the club.
A condition for that to happen would be that Abramovich - one of Russia's richest people and believed to be close to Russian president Vladimir Putin - receives no funds.
He has previously said proceeds of any sale would be donated to ""victims of the war in Ukraine"".
'There are bigger situations'
Speaking after Chelsea beat West Ham to move to within five points of WSL leaders Arsenal, Hayes said there were a ""million questions"" that needed answering.
But she added: ""I don't battle with things I cannot control. I will probably learn more in the coming days and weeks.
""We're aware of what's going on, but there's a war going on in Ukraine, there are bigger situations.
""It's important for the players, the staff, the fans to be patient and let's sort through that and hopefully that process won't take too long.""
Emma Hayes has appealed for fans to be patient and that Chelsea will prevail
'It's not hyperbole to say the future of the club is in serious danger'
Analysis: Pat Nevin, former Chelsea winger speaking to BBC Radio 5 Live
We are in unchartered water, but the football side, what will happen to the club now? No-one knows. I can tell you something, it's very serious.
I heard someone say recently the wage bill is £28m a week. Where will you get that if you can't trade? If this carries on for a period of time, it's strange looking to see how the club is viable in its current form.
It's not hyperbole to say the future of the club is in serious danger.
I can't say 'everything will be OK'. I think the club will survive. Will it look the same after all this is over? No, I don't think that will be the case.

Bonner's century was his second in Tests. Both have come at the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium
First Test, Sir Vivian Richards Stadium, Antigua (day three):
England 311: Bairstow 140, Foakes 42; Seales 4-79
West Indies 373-9: Bonner 123, Brathwaite 55; Stokes 2-42
West Indies lead by 62 runs
Scorecard
An uninspiring England toiled as Nkrumah Bonner's determined century put West Indies on top after day three of the first Test in Antigua.
On a slow day, Bonner ground out 123 from 355 balls as his side reached 373-9 at the close with a lead of 62.
England's new-look attack, albeit on a docile pitch and hampered by losing fast bowler Mark Wood to injury, again found wicket-taking hard.
Ben Stokes had Jason Holder caught behind for 45 early on and Jack Leach trapped Joshua da Silva lbw for 32.
But the tourists were held up for almost 30 overs by a stand between Bonner and number nine Kemar Roach, who made 15 from 89 balls.
Roach was run out in the final session, only for number 10 Veerasammy Permaul to frustrate England further with a 87-ball 26.
Bonner, who could have been caught on 73, batted patiently throughout. He finally fell in the third to last over of the day when the third umpire judged he had tickled a catch down the leg side off part-time off-spinner Dan Lawrence.
That wicket gave England some cause for celebration but the hosts still sit in a strong position with two days to go.
England in West Indies 2022
England struggle in the sun
Any criticism of England's bowlers must come with the caveat that this pitch at the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium is slow and has offered minimal support to pace or spin bowlers.
Afterwards, interim coach Paul Collingwood, referencing the surface and England's effort, called the performance ""probably one of the best I have seen in an England shirt"".
But, with the dropped Stuart Broad and James Anderson again notable by their absence, England's tame attack lacked threat once more in an innings that has now lasted 157 overs.
Stokes bowled admirably, giving England with the wicket of Holder with only four runs added to the overnight score.
But the new ball, taken soon after the start with West Indies five down and still 84 runs behind, came and went with little effect.
Craig Overton often bowled below 80mph and Chris Woakes showed little sign of overturning his poor overseas record, with wicketkeeper Ben Foakes standing up to both at times.
England have only won one of their past 14 Tests
The loss of Wood hurt England badly. He left the field with an elbow issue after one over with the new ball, having only bowled four previously, and is now a doubt to take further part in the Test.
Without their quickest bowler, England struggled to remove West Indies batters who rarely showed aggression. It took a misjudged run and a good throw by substitute fielder Ollie Pope to eventually see off Roach, ending his stand with Bonner.
Left-arm spinner Jack Leach was the most likely wicket-taker, even with little turn to aid him.
Bonner inside edged the Somerset bowler onto his pad when flicking to leg but Crawley could not take the ball when it deflected to him at slip. After passing 100, Bonner twice survived tight lbw decisions on review - Leach the bowler on both occasions.
Bonner may have fallen near the end of the day but has still hurt England's hopes in the Test significantly. There could be further repercussions given the loss of Wood and the number of overs now in the bowlers' legs.
Bonner digs in
This hundred is right-hander Bonner's second in 10 Tests, both of which have come on this ground. 
He resumed on 34 and, while favouring the leg side, quietly accumulated in composed fashion.
Just 51 runs were scored in 30 overs in the afternoon session, the surface doing little to help run-scoring. That may have been a factor in West Indies' decision not to up the rate, declare and bowl at England late on. 
Bonner, 33, looked to be easing to the close in steady fashion when he was dismissed, somewhat controversially. 
The technology showed the tiniest spike when England called for a review after appealing for a leg-side catch. 
It did not look definitive but TV umpire Leslie Reifer deemed it enough to overturn the original decision.
'Very much West Indies' day' - reaction 
England interim coach Paul Collingwood, speaking to BBC Sport: ""Today was probably one of the best days I have seen in an England shirt. 
""To go for 170 runs and five wickets on that today is a pretty good effort, especially backing that up from two sessions in the field yesterday. 
""It was tough, hard work. It is a docile pitch. Sometimes you can look at the scoreboard and say you haven't bowled them out but I thought the attitude was superb today. If you know anything about cricket you will know how that pitch is playing.""
West Indies batter Nkrumah Bonner, speaking to BT Sport: ""It means a lot for me. Looking back at my stats before this series I had not scored major runs in the Caribbean, so am very happy I stepped forward.
""It's a good venue, a good pitch to bat on. Tomorrow we want to bat an hour, get a lead of 100 to put pressure on the English batters.""
BBC cricket correspondent Jonathan Agnew: ""It was very much West Indies' day. It hasn't been a pretty watch, but they've done what they had to do in these very difficult scoring conditions. It is easy to defend as a batter, but difficult to score at any pace unless you bowl poorly.""

279,279,Commanding Rangers take big step towards Europa League quarter-finals,"Thu, 10 Mar 2022 22:24:57 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/60594728,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/60594728?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,Rangers take a significant step towards the Europa League quarter-finals with a pulsating statement win over Red Star Belgrade at a raucous Ibrox.,"Rangers 3-0 Red Star Belgrade: Europa League quarters in sight for Scottish champions
Could Leon Balogun's second-half header prove decisive for Rangers in Serbia next week?
Rangers took a significant step towards the Europa League quarter-finals with a pulsating statement win over Red Star Belgrade at a raucous Ibrox. 
James Tavernier's penalty and Alfredo Morelos' strike in the first 15 minutes sparked the game into life, before Aleksandar Katai - who had already had two efforts ruled offside - had a spot kick saved superbly by Allan McGregor.
That was all in a frantic opening 24 minutes and, although the tempo slowed, Leon Balogun's towering header gave Rangers a commanding lead to protect.
Inconsistent league form has caused the reigning Scottish champions to slip three points adrift in the Premiership, but they seem to find something within them for European nights, having done for Borussia Dortmund in a famous victory in the previous round.
And Giovanni van Bronckhorst's men rose to the occasion again against the Serbian title holders, giving themselves a golden chance to finish the job next Thursday and reach the last eight of the competition for the first time since 2008.
Podcast: 'Red Star didn't give Rangers respect they deserve'
How McGregor continues to confound critics
Reaction & as it happened
Having already accounted for Alashkert, Brondby, Sparta Prague and Dortmund in the Europa League, there was a fearless nature about Rangers as Red Star travelled to Govan. 
That mentality was demonstrated throughout the 90 minutes as Tavernier - just as he did in both legs against Dortmund - broke the deadlock from the spot after a lengthy VAR check judged Slavoljub Srnic's lazy leg to have tripped Ryan Kent.
Van Bronckhorst couldn't watch on the touchline, but the Dutchman opened his eyes to see a bouncing Ibrox as the captain's penalty rippled in the top-right corner.
That came after Red Star's Katai had a delightful finish ruled out for offside, and the hosts suffered another scare when Katai rounded McGregor and found the back of the net again, but the striker was against frustrated by the assistant's flag.
Red Star's misfortune was Rangers' gain when the Scottish champions raced up the other end and doubled their lead. Ryan Jack's clipped cross to the back post headed out to Morelos, who guided a first-time finish on the half-volley into the net.
It was a 32nd Europa League goal for the Colombian - only former Celtic striker Henrik Larsson (40) and ex-Netherlands forward Klaas Jan Huntelaar (34) have scored more in the competition.
Rangers were purring, and with a cleaner connection from Kent, who scuffed a close-range finish into the grateful arms of Borjan, the hosts would have had a remarkable three-goal lead before the halfway stage of the first half.
The Serbs were still posing a threat, though, and had a golden chance of their own to pull a goal back when Jack tugged Mirko Ivanic in the box.
Katai stepped up, but the Red Star forward - who has 23 goals in 34 games so far this term - was denied by McGregor, who flung himself to his right and got a strong wrist behind the fiercely-struck spot kick.
There were a few minutes to catch breath before a little more first-half drama, when scintillating build-up resulted in Kamara skiing over, before Ohi Omoijuanfo's sliding effort up the other end trickled into the arms of McGregor.
Rangers fans were treated to a memorable Ibrox night against Dortmund, and there was more bedlam in the stadium when Balogun towered above everyone in the area to power in Tavernier's corner shortly after the break.
Tavernier then had a free-kick curl the wrong side of a post before the captain delivered on three occasions for Goldson, who had one header cleared off the line, another saved by Borjan, and knocked a third wide at the back post.
With Rangers tiring, and a second leg to play, Red Star fought to reduce the deficit and had second-half efforts thwarted by the enduring McGregor.
El Fardou Ben and Katai were both denied at the Rangers keeper's near post either side of a stunning long-range effort from Guelor Kanga that crashed off the bar.
And with the game in the closing stages, McGregor again had to be alert to deny Ivanic, with Ben Nabouhane's tap-in on the rebound disallowed by another assistant's flag, meaning the Ibrox side take a three-goal lead into next Thursday's second leg.
Man of the match - James Tavernier
Another game, another goal and another assist in an outstanding all-round display from the captain
What did we learn?
Van Bronckhorst will be understandably elated with his players after yet another notable win in Europe, but the Dutchman must be scratching his head at where these performances are domestically.
There is no doubt about it, if Rangers play like this consistently in the Premiership, they retain the title. But consistency has been lacking this year, and could cost them the championship.
In a game of fine margins, the contest could have been so different if Katai's penalty or any of Red Star's three, correctly disallowed, offside goals had gone the other way.
The Serbian champions look a tidy outfit, and while Rangers appear to have one foot in the quarters, they cannot afford to take Stankovic's men lightly next week in what will be a hostile atmosphere in Belgrade.
What did they say?
Rangers manager Giovanni van Bronckhorst to BT Sport: ""I'm very pleased, it was a really tough game. The 3-0 scoreline, you wouldn't expect it when you see the game, but in the end I'm happy we scored three goals.  
""You could see the quality of the team, they're not bad, but I think we performed really well. John [Lundstram] had an important role, we prepared him for the different systems we could play against. He was the key second half.""
Match stats
Having lost their opening two Europa League group games this season, Rangers are unbeaten in their last seven, winning four and drawing three.  
This is the first time they have kept a clean sheet at home in a Europa League knockout tie. They've conceded in each of their seven previous games, losing 13 goals in total.
Red Star have only won one of their seven matches in Scotland (D2 L4), with that victory in November 1961 against Hibernian in the Fairs Cup. 
Tavernier has had as many goal involvements in eight Europa League games this season (4 goals, 2 assists) as in his previous 25 European club games (3 goals, 3 assists).
The Rangers captain has scored more penalties (3) than any other player in the Europa League this season, while no player has won more penalties than Kent (2).
Since his first season in the Europa League in 2018-19, only Munas Dabbur (17) and Bruno Fernandes (16) have scored more goals in the competition than Morelos (15).
What's next?
Rangers are in Scottish Cup quarter-final duty on Sunday as they go to Dundee (16:00 GMT), before next Thursday's second leg in Belgrade (17:45).

Hamilton and Verstappen met again in Bahrain for second testing
Mercedes are at the centre of a row over the legality of their car after introducing a radical new design at the second pre-season test.
Formula 1 managing director Ross Brawn said the car's aerodynamics around its sidepods was a ""very extreme interpretation of the regulations"".
Red Bull team boss Christian Horner told Germany's Auto Motor Und Sport: ""Mercedes have gone a step too far. 
""That does not correspond to the spirit of the regulations,"" he said.
""For us, these wings are illegal.""
Red Bull initially described the quotes attributed to Horner as ""incorrect"", before clarifying they were not ""official"".
Horner later told Sky Sports: ""I was slightly surprised to be reading comments that I was supposed to have been making.
Testing schedule
""I haven't paid a great deal of attention to [the Mercedes car]. It is obviously a fairly different concept, but that is for the aero guys and the designers to get into.""
The revised Mercedes has been dubbed the ""no sidepod car"" because of the extreme way the world champions have managed to shrink the bodywork beside the driver around the car's cooling requirements.
Horner also seems to have taken issue with the integration of a shaped side-impact structure on which the rear-view mirrors are mounted.
He said: ""Those are not mirror mounts, but two wings. In addition, they have built vertical baffles on top. They have nothing to do with the mirror mount.""
Ferrari team principal Mattia Binotto also raised questions about the Mercedes design.
""No doubt it is a great car - that should not be a surprise to us,"" he said. ""A concept quite different to ours, quite interesting with the cooling layout, and the sidepods. 
""On the mirrors, it was surprising - we were not expecting that. We always said the mirror should have no aero[dynamic] purpose and the way they treated their cars there is a significant aero purpose in the mirrors.
""The risk in the future is that all teams will start designing mirrors that look like spaceships. In the spirit of what we intend to do for the future, it is something we need to discuss.""
Mercedes F1 team principal Toto Wolff said he was not concerned about any problems developing with the rules.
Wolff said governing body the FIA had been involved throughout the design process.
""It's clear that sometimes when you come with an innovation it creates the kind of debate we're having here,"" Wolff added. ""It was expected.
""We were keen in not running alone with that, but being in touch with the FIA. That's why I think it will be OK.""
Brawn emphasised that, under F1's new governance procedure this year, rules can be changed mid-season if eight of the 10 teams agree.
""Once the interpretation Mercedes has made has been understood, then we can get a balanced view on what impact it's going to have,"" he said.
""The 'spirit' [of the rules] is such a grey area. At the end of the day, you have to go on the wording of the regulations, but that wording can be changed with an 80% team majority.
""If something has slipped by [in the rule-writing process], then the teams are aware that can happen. So that could happen live during the season. We'll have to see how this one plays out.""
The Mercedes car featured different sidepod designs
Brawn said his primary concern was whether teams' designs undermine the intent of the rules to make racing better by allowing cars to follow each other more closely than in the past.
Out on the track, Alpha Tauri's Pierre Gasly set the fastest time of the day, ahead of the Ferraris of Charles Leclerc and Carlos Sainz and Lance Stroll's Aston Martin.
Headline lap times in testing are unreliable indicators of actual competitiveness because of the myriad ways teams can alter their cars' specification to affect lap time.
Mercedes drivers George Russell and Lewis Hamilton were ninth and 11th fastest after Russell drove in the afternoon session and the seven-time champion went out in the morning.
Russell said of the car's new features: ""It looks interesting but it's not about how it looks it's about how fast it goes. It caught quite a few people's eyes this morning.
""I am proud to be part of a team that is pushing innovation and seeing something pretty spectacular being pulled off is pretty incredible.""
The session was stopped eight minutes early when Red Bull's Sergio Perez had a spin and then inadvertently reversed into the gravel and became stuck when trying to get going again.

WSL highlights: West Ham 1-4 Chelsea
On a tumultuous day for Chelsea, they cruised to a commanding win over West Ham and closed the gap on league leaders Arsenal to five points.
Manager Emma Hayes spoke of a ""difficult day"" after Roman Abramovich's attempt to sell the club was halted by government sanctions.
Pernille Harder scored twice with Niamh Charles and Sam Kerr also on target.
Dagny Brynjarsdottir's second-half goal for West Ham was not enough to trouble the champions.
'There's no denying it's a difficult day' - Emma Hayes
Abramovich's attempt to sell Chelsea halted by UK government
What do Chelsea's sanctions mean? Your questions answered
Before the match, Hayes said that she hoped her players would be able to ""switch off"" for 90 minutes and forget about what has undoubtedly been a tough day for the London club.
Chelsea were all over West Ham from the first whistle and Harder's 14th goal of the season came after 20 minutes to reward the Blues' pressure.
Charles' long-range shot took a wicked deflection off West Ham captain Gilly Flaherty just three minutes later before Ji's sublime floated ball into the box was nodded home by Harder.
West Ham had their chances - Katerina Svitkova should have scored from a header while West Ham's top goalscorer Claudia Walker also came close - but the damage had already been done.
Kerr silenced West Ham's hopes of a comeback with a clinical right-footed finish, Chelsea's only shot on target in the second half, after Brynjarsdottir had pulled one back for West Ham just after the break. 
The victory takes the Blues, who were beaten in the Continental Cup final by Manchester City, to within five points of Arsenal with two games in hand and ends West Ham's 10-game unbeaten run at home.
'It was nice to think about football for 90 minutes'
Hayes said she is having to ""deal with different questions"" everyday but that she was proud of her ""adaptable and resilient group"", who are focused on the hunt for a trophy.
""I think the club has to have time now with the government to dissect the implications of the sanctions and it has to be a two-way process to determine how to run, operate and how to exist in this period,"" she said.
""We all have a million questions but I don't battle with things I can't control I will probably learn more in the coming days and weeks.""
She added: ""Yes today is a big moment for the club, but I believe in giving both sides the time to get it right going forward. It's important for the players, the staff and the fans to be patient and hopefully that process won't take too long.""

283,283,Ukraine war: Kyiv prepares for Russian attack,"Fri, 11 Mar 2022 20:04:59 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-60714515,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-60714515?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,"As Russian forces continue their slow advance, Kyiv's residents fear the worst for their city.","Ukraine war: Kyiv prepares for Russian attack
When the Russian offensive started, as sirens sounded in Kyiv for the first time, some people here feared that the city might fall by the afternoon. 
Reports were coming in of a long convoy of armour and heavy weapons pushing down from the north-west. Military analysts had a high opinion of the Russian army. It had, they said, been professionalised, with invaluable experience of perfecting weapons and seasoning men in the war in Syria. The tactical errors I had seen the Russians commit when they tried to crush a rebellion in the republic of Chechnya in 1995 were, I was told, ancient history. 
The consensus about the Ukrainian armed forces on the first day of the war was that they were much stronger than they had been in 2014, when they could not stop Russia seizing Crimea and establishing two breakaway enclaves in eastern Ukraine. But Russia had the numbers and the firepower. The Ukrainians, it was said, would rediscover the truth of an aphorism attributed to Stalin: ""quantity has a quality of its own."" 
The first two weeks of the war proved that those predictions were wrong. The Russians blundered; the Ukrainians resisted. Around Kyiv the Russian advance stalled. In the south, it was a different story. They worked steadily towards opening a land corridor between Crimea and Moscow's enclaves in eastern Ukraine. 
But it has been clear from the outset that control of Kyiv is crucial to winning arguments in politics as well as on the battlefield.  While President Volodymyr Zelensky's government holds the city, he can claim not to be defeated, and President Vladimir Putin in the Kremlin cannot claim victory. 
The last couple of days have been bright and sunny, after more than a week of thick cloud. That means satellites have a clear view of movements on the ground. One conclusion is that the 40-mile Russian convoy north-west of Kyiv is slowly dispersing and reorganising. The latest word from the US Department of Defense is that the rear elements are catching up, but the vehicles closest to Kyiv are not moving. 
The fighting around Kyiv has been concentrated in the north-west and has been going on since the first morning, when Russian airborne troops landed at a cargo airport near Hostomel and Irpin, small commuter towns that evacuees say are now badly damaged. They looked to be trying to secure a staging area for a push into Kyiv. But  Ukrainian troops stopped them. 
In the last few days, I have seen more defenders moving forward to continue the fight around Irpin and the Hostomel airport and heard steady artillery fire from the Ukrainian side from gunlines concealed in belts of thick woodland. 
The heavily contested north-west is just a 20-minute drive from the centre of Kyiv, which has barely been touched, although sirens sound regular alerts. 
In the week or so that I have been here the Ukrainians have improved their physical defences, which in places barely existed. Checkpoints that were just a few concrete blocks have become barricades. Across the city men have been filling and positioning sandbags. Kyiv's metalworkers have been busy. At strategic junctions, and on the dual carriageways that run out of Kyiv steel anti-tank obstacles stand ready. 
Kyiv is a grand city of broad, sweeping avenues, bisected by narrower streets often paved with lumpy cobblestones. Many of the buildings have extensive basements and cellars. Street fighting here, if it happened, could grind on for months. 
The city sprawls along both banks of the Dnieper, one of Europe's great rivers. Docks and marinas leading off the river are still frozen. Crossing the water under fire would be a formidable military undertaking. The bank on the west side of the river, near the government buildings and the great cathedrals, is steep and heavily wooded. Defenders would have many advantages.  
But crossing the Dnieper might not be on Russia's agenda until it is able to control both banks.  One theory is that the stalled offensive from the west and north-west is not just because of Ukrainian resistance and what appears to be the Russian army's own badly handled logistics. A column coming from the east has been moving slowly, and the generals might be waiting for it to catch up.  
The Russians attempted to move a regiment of tanks into Kyiv's eastern approaches on Thursday. They were mauled badly as they rumbled slowly down a highway in broad daylight. Drone pictures showed that the tanks were bunched together making easy targets for Ukrainian artillery or drones. It was another tactical blunder for Moscow.  
It is not clear whether Russia plans to encircle Kyiv or attempt to force a surrender by thrusting into the centre with armour supported by infantry. The choices are not great for them. Direct attacks have so far been stopped. Encircling a big city might take too many men.  
One possibility is that President Putin expected the rapid collapse of a government that he has dismissed with contempt as a Nazi collaboration with the west and did not think his soldiers would need to do either.  
It is certain that Putin and his generals are reassessing, regrouping and will not accept defeat. Putin's mission has been to restore Russia to what he believes is its rightful place as a world power. In a country the size of Ukraine - only Russia itself is bigger in Europe - victory in Kyiv is the most direct way for him to declare mission accomplished.  
Without a doubt the Russian armed forces have been operating at half power and half speed. That is partly due to their own mistakes, and partly because the Ukrainians are proving to be formidable, nimble opponents. The stalled attacks around Kyiv have turned into a respite for the city's defenders, allowing them time to dig to improve defences that were rudimentary, and presumably to receive some of the increasingly sophisticated weapons that NATO is bringing into Ukraine.  
A question that nags uncomfortably at the minds of many in Kyiv is whether President Putin will conclude that the time has come to turn the deadliest conventional weapons in Russia's arsenal against the city's defenders. So far that has not happened. If it does, many more people will die and terrible damage will be done.  
Some people here do not believe President Putin will hammer Kyiv in the way that cities in eastern and southern Ukraine have been attacked. They argue Putin will hesitate to destroy an ancient city which has been at the centre of Russian culture, religion and history. Some of the same people also believed Russia would not invade.  
Others fear that if Russian infantry and armour are held up, Putin and his generals will default to the tactics they are using in Mariupol in the south, surrounding the city and attempting to break the will of its defenders with artillery and air strikes. It is a method that worked well for the Russians in Syria, and in the 1990s when Grozny, the capital of the breakaway Russian republic of Chechnya, was flattened.  
The next few weeks will be critical for the future of Kyiv, and for the wider war over the future of Ukraine. If Russia cannot reactivate its attack on the capital, its defenders will grow in confidence and the strength and the morale of Russian forces, including conscripts, will take more blows. 
If the Putin regime can find a way to end resistance here, the president will be closer to achieving his war aim of ending Ukraine's independence. Forcing the country back into Russia's orbit, in the face of what would most likely be a Nato-backed insurgency, would be an altogether more difficult job.

Russia has been shelling the city
The boom of artillery, muffled by heavy snowfall, echoes across the southern Ukrainian city of Mykolaiv, triggering a series of air raid sirens. 
In the faded grandeur of a long-abandoned club for navy officers, 29-year-old Anastasia Aleksieieva is gathering food supplies, medicines and even home-made steel plates, carved out of local cars, for use as body armour.
Mykolaiv is now firmly in the sights of the Russian army - troops invaded from the nearby Crimea peninsula and have had more success in taking territory in this region than Russian forces elsewhere in Ukraine.
As the Russians work their way west towards the city people are starting to flee and the hospitals are filling with the injured.
But Anastasia has decided to stay, sending her one-year-old daughter and her mother away to safety.
""I'm a mum of my baby. But I have to help because I know how to do it,"" the former army captain explains to the BBC.
The attack on a hospital in the besieged south-eastern city of Mariupol on Tuesday made her decide she had no other choice.
""That was the hardest moment for me,"" she says.
""I'm a mum - but I have to stay,"" says ex-army captain 29-year-old Anastasia Aleksieieva
Ukrainian forces in the city have, for more than a week now, successfully thwarted a major Russian advance west towards the larger port of Odesa.
In the city centre, Mykolaiv's governor Vitaliy Kim is standing in fatigues, explaining how Ukrainian soldiers, helped by new reinforcements, had pushed Russian troops back between 15 and 20km (nine to 12 miles) towards the east, and had even surrounded some Russian units which were now in negotiations for their surrender.
Some of those troops were reportedly preparing to bring the captured and damaged Russian tanks into the city to show to residents.
But Mr Kim warns this is not a time to celebrate prematurely. 
""We are winning this fight, but not this war,"" he says.
The governor said a relatively weak Russian force had underestimated local resistance and expected to ""be greeted with flowers"", but Russian reinforcements and planes could quickly turn the tide and enable the Kremlin to capture the whole Black Sea coastline. 
""We need a closed sky,"" he said, referring to the idea of a no-fly zone enforced by Nato. The Western alliance has so far rejected such an idea, as it could bring them into direct conflict with Russian planes that entered the area.
In the local hospital, head doctor Alexander Dimyanov said 250 Ukrainian soldiers and civilians had been injured in the past fortnight, 12 fatally. Three patients, too sick to be moved further west to safety, remained on the trauma ward.
""We're exhausted,"" said a nurse, who declined to give her name. Dr Dimyanov showed a video of his colleagues in tears, explaining that they were overwhelmed by the workload and by fears that their own families might be hurt.
""They're crying because they don't know if they'll see them again. They don't run away. They work here every day. We have a lot of wounded people, every day. They see the blood,"" said Dr Dimyanov, who also called on the West to impose a no-fly zone.
Civilians have been fleeing, heading west towards Moldova
Inhabitants of several apartment blocks in a civilian neighbourhood in the east of the city showed us where rockets or shells had hit their buildings in recent days, tearing holes in a stairwell and water pipes, and breaking dozens of windows. 
""It's rocket and artillery fire at night. And it's pretty scary here. Very loud, especially at night,"" said 17-year-old Bogdan Somberakov.
He was waiting for a lift with his luggage and his family on the western edge of Mykolaiv. 
As he spoke a long convoy of coaches passed by, carrying children west towards the Moldovan border and safety.

286,286,Roman Abramovich: Chelsea have credit card facilities temporarily suspended,"Fri, 11 Mar 2022 20:01:22 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/60714952,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/60714952?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,Chelsea's credit card facilities are temporarily suspended while banks assess the implications of the sanctions imposed on Russian billionaire owner Roman Abramovich.,"Roman Abramovich: Chelsea have credit card facilities temporarily suspended
Roman Abramovich has been in charge of Chelsea since 2003
Chelsea's credit card facilities have been temporarily suspended while banks assess the implications of sanctions imposed on Russian billionaire owner Roman Abramovich.
The club has been given a special licence to operate despite Abramovich having his assets frozen by the UK government.
Banks want to assess the licence criteria to ensure it does not breach the government's sanctions and Chelsea do not know when the suspension will be lifted. 
As part of the licence terms, Chelsea cannot receive money for match tickets which have not already been sold, future gate receipts for FA Cup games or merchandise from the club shop.
That is likely to leave the club with a huge shortfall, with their monthly wage bill amounting to £28m a month. 
In discussions with the government on Thursday and Friday Chelsea made applications to change the terms of the licence which would allow the club to receive money for ticket sales, and also boost its limits on spending. 
The current licence allows £500,000 to be spent on home matches and allows a £20,000 limit on away travel. 
Talks were also held regarding an amendment to the licence about a potential sale of the club and included Raine Group - the American investment firm instructed to handle the sale before Abramovich was sanctioned.

The Football News Show: What do sanctions mean for the sale of Chelsea?
On Friday, a spokesman for the Prime Minister later said the government was ""in constant contact"" with Chelsea and the Premier League and said the Blues could apply for an ""amended licence"".
They added: ""I believe Chelsea have said that they will do that, and we'll obviously work with the club and the league to consider any operationally necessary changes.""
The club has already sold tickets for its game at home to Newcastle on Sunday and Chelsea are set to travel to Lille for a Champions League tie on Wednesday. The home match against Brentford on 2 April is sold out, but tickets will not be able to be sold for games after that. 
It is unclear what would happen to gate receipts for the club's FA Cup quarter-final against Championship side Middlesbrough on 19 March, with 45% going to each team.

Tuchel open to peace message
Chelsea manager Thomas Tuchel raised the prospect of his players wearing a ""message for peace"" on their shirts, after mobile network provider Three suspended its shirt sponsorship deal with the club.
""Maybe the worry is more to find enough shirts that we can play in, with the sanctions,"" Tuchel added. ""But as long as we have enough shirts, and as long as the bus is full of fuel, we will arrive and we will be competitive.

""This is what everybody can be sure of and this is what we demand of ourselves and when it's a big storm, you dig in, you are all together and then you stay strong and go through it.
""But messages for peace can never be wrong.""
Meanwhile, Chelsea fans have been urged to stop chanting in support of Abramovich, after supporters sang the Russian's name during Chelsea's win at Norwich on Thursday.
Technology minister Chris Philp told BBC Radio Four's Today programme that fans need to remember Abramovich has close ties with Russian president Vladimir Putin, whose regime has committed ""barbaric acts"" in Ukraine.
'We're in 2022 and to see this is horrible for everybody'
Premier League managers gave their views on the sanctioning of Abramovich for the first time on Friday.
Former Chelsea manager Antonio Conte - now in charge at Tottenham - said: ""It's very sad that this serious situation, this war between Russia and Ukraine, is affecting football and the sporting world.
""To know that Russia athletes are banned from competition is very sad. I think it's not fair. I know very well the work that they do every day for this competition.
""You have to pay for this situation, I think it's not right. Honestly, I hoped the situation is going to be solved, because it's creating a lot of damage. We're in 2022 and to see this is horrible for everybody.""
Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp sympathised with employees at Chelsea but believes the government was ""right"" to sanction Abramovich because ""he is close"" to Putin.
Newcastle manager Eddie Howe believes the sanctions will not change how Chelsea perform, while Leicester manager Brendan Rodgers - who previously worked at Chelsea as a youth and reserve-team coach - said Tuchel's situation is challenging.
""I've total empathy for him and for the players, but they're very professional,"" said Rodgers. ""They're an outstanding team and I'm sure they'll focus on that element between now and the end of the season.""

287,287,The race is on for affordable energy for the UK's homes and businesses,"Sat, 12 Mar 2022 00:19:48 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-60712673,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-60712673?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,War in Ukraine has focused minds on how to get enough affordable energy for homes and businesses.,"The race is on for affordable energy for the UK's homes and businesses
There's a new buzz phrase in government: energy independence.
The war in Ukraine has focused ministers' minds on the need to stop procuring energy from abroad and, when it comes to Russia, financing a foe in the process. 
One backbench Tory MP did not mince his words, telling me ""every missile dropped on Ukraine has been financed by the West buying Russian gas"".
The challenge ahead for ministers is twofold: making sure we have enough energy to heat our homes, power our businesses and fuel our cars - and making sure it does not become so unaffordable that businesses collapse and households are pushed into poverty.
So what's the plan?
Well, the week after next, the prime minister and business secretary are expected to set out their ""energy supply strategy"".
It's likely to focus on four core areas: nuclear energy, renewable energy, making homes more energy efficient, and increasing North Sea oil and gas production.
Cost of living crisis: Sunak's menu of options
Most homes to get energy bill relief of £350
Can the energy crisis help the climate?
On that last point: government sources insist this is not about burning more gas, but about sourcing more gas domestically while the UK moves to renewable energy sources. 
Downing Street is adamant their net zero targets remain intact - despite opposition from a Net Zero Scrutiny group of backbench Tory MPs. 
A source said cheaper energy from the sun, wind and nuclear was the ""only real long-term answer to the cost of living crisis"" and they ""can't bung people subsidies forever because prices are high"".
North Sea production could be stepped up in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine
It now looks increasingly likely, for example, that planning laws could be loosened for onshore wind farms.
Ahead of the government's energy supply strategy, the prime minister is speaking to leaders of major oil producing countries around the world this coming week.
I'm also told Boris Johnson will be making announcements imminently about a new team of advisers to ""kick"" business into accelerating renewable energy plans. 
I'm told these will include ""one of the most distinguished industry experts out there"" and energy finance experts who will form an ""independent energy task force"" - as well as a cabinet sub-committee of ministers. 
Fracking calls 
There is also a growing caucus of Tory MPs, including former ministers Lord Frost and Steve Baker, calling for the government to re-examine the controversial practice of fracking in the UK - drilling down into the earth to release shale gas.
A ban was placed on fracking in 2019 due to earthquake safety concerns, and the Tory manifesto said they would ""not support fracking unless the science shows categorically that it can be done safely"".
Many of its proponents, however, got excited this week after No 10 suggested the prime minister has agreed to look at it again to ""see if it has a role to play"".
Downing Street sources told me that with oil prices so high, there were things ""we would have dismissed before that we can't dismiss now"" - and while their end goal is new sources of energy, ""in the transition period we need to pump more oil and gas of our own"" and it's ""in that context we should look at fracking"". 
Fracking has its champions in cabinet, with Brexit opportunities minister Jacob Rees-Mogg said to be ""extremely keen"" on the idea.
But the reality is the prime minister himself sees a lot of problems with it. Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng has also pretty stridently distanced himself from entertaining the idea. 
Other senior government insiders feel, for all the talk of the door being left open to it, that this is partly to keep some of the more vocal backbenchers happy - with one saying they would be ""staggered"" if the prime minister folded on it. 
Another joked, in response to various newspaper headlines, that you could say the Tory manifesto left the door open to fracking if the science changed - but that it hadn't. 
Previous plans to introduce fracking have prompted protests in the north of England
While renewable energy is heralded as the solution to the cost of living crisis long-term, a more pressing political debate is how to mitigate soaring energy bills for households right now. 
No 10 commissioned the business secretary and his team to come up with ideas for the upcoming energy supply strategy - including help for consumers. 
The team distanced themselves from taking any particular view on this issue, but the options they set out were tweaks to the Treasury's energy bill rebate scheme - £200 loans for customers to be repaid in £40 instalments from 2023. 
These included doubling the loan, delaying the start of repayments, and making the rebate more generous for poorer households. 
The Treasury - who were not looped into this particular commission involving their policy - quickly shut down the idea of any changes to the rebate scheme being on the table. 
More on the cost of living:

WARNING: UK faces biggest income squeeze in decades
APPEAL: Campaigner says families need urgent help
Government insiders feel that, broadly, Tory MPs are content with the policy that was announced - although one described an internal ""wobble"" when the personal finance expert Martin Lewis publicly cast doubt on the ""loan"" element of the scheme. 
But Tory MPs have been more vocal in calling for other government interventions on the cost of living.
Some want green levies or VAT on energy bills to be scrapped, the National Insurance rise scrapped, fuel duty cut, or further boosts to benefits like Universal Credit or the Warm Homes Discount. 
While a Treasury source said the chancellor will ""always review our policies and how we can help"", it's unlikely these calls will be heeded at his upcoming Spring Statement on 23 March for reasons we set out here. 
The National Insurance tax rise is definitely going ahead in April, and scrapping VAT or green levies on energy bills are ""not a go-er"", sources say. 
The chancellor is not expected to tweak tax policy this month, which rules out cutting fuel duty for now, though it remains frozen. 
MPs are getting noisier about pump prices though, and the door doesn't seem completely closed to further intervention should fuel prices continue to spiral.

""A year's worth of petrol price rises in six days""
Further boosting welfare benefits like Universal Credit and the Warm Homes Discount is also a thorny issue for the Conservatives. 
One government insider stressed that the party has argued for years they need to ""make work pay"", another described expanding these benefits further could be a ""disincentive to work"".
The logic behind the energy bills rebate scheme, too, was that it applied to middle income, as well as the poorest, households - all affected by energy bill increases. 
But critical Tories, including some former work and pensions secretaries, have argued unprecedented price rises since the pandemic demand a more generous approach to welfare.
Treasury sources have downplayed the suggestion that we are likely to see any major new cost of living announcements at the Spring Statement given the volatility of the current situation - and not being able to predict what gas prices will look like by October, when the energy price cap (the maximum households can pay for bills) is set to rise again. 
But a Treasury source said: ""We've essentially come up from a once in a lifetime crisis with the pandemic and straight into the next crisis… we will keep continuing to look at ways we can help people out.""

288,288,Fears funeral plan reforms could mean thousands lose money,"Sat, 12 Mar 2022 00:51:39 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-60667173,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-60667173?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,There is growing concern that tougher regulations for funeral plan providers could hit many customers.,"Fears funeral plan reforms could mean thousands lose money
Lyn Burrow is worried she might lose some, or all, of their money
""It has given me sleepless nights, I've been up at 3 o'clock in the morning wondering what the outcome will be.""
72-year-old Lyn Burrow is talking about the thousands of pounds she's paid to cover the cost of her funeral when she dies.
She and her husband Fred, 80, spent a total of £6,310 with funeral plan provider Safe Hands.
Now they're worried they might lose some, or even all, of their money.
The funeral plan market is being reformed and industry insiders are worried that this could mean some providers will go out of business, leaving tens of thousands of customers out of pocket.
""The way things sounded we stood the chance of losing all the money we had paid for these plans, so we decided we would cancel the plans and would just have to swallow the £800 cancellation fees,"" says Lyn.
""We felt if we at least got some money back it would be better than nothing"".
Safe Hands, which has withdrawn its application for approval by the UK's financial regulator, meaning it will not be allowed to operate after 29 July, told Lyn it hoped to find another funeral provider to take over its client book.
It also said Lyn would have to wait a month for her refund, leaving her worried she may not see any money at all. Safe Hands did not reply to the BBC's numerous requests for comment.
More regulation, more protection
People like Lyn and Fred are worried because the UK's funeral plan sector is being reformed by the UK's financial watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).
From 29 July, any provider must be authorised and regulated by the FCA, external which, from that point onwards, will give consumers far greater protection than they have at the moment.
The FCA says reform is needed because elderly, and very often vulnerable, customers have been subjected to unfair practices like high pressure sales tactics and cold calls, and it wants to raise standards by regulating what companies can and cannot do.
The very real problem for people like Lyn and Fred though is that whilst the regulation of funeral plan companies will be a good thing in future, getting to that point could mean some people lose out.
""There are around 65 firms that operate in this sector and not all of them will be able to demonstrate they can meet the standards that will ensure protection for consumers in the future"" according to industry expert Kate Robinson from Avyse Partners, which specialises in regulatory consultancy.
""The point is - firms which don't go for authorisation will either choose not to be regulated or won't be able to meet the new standards because they present such a significant step change to what was in place previously.
""This means some providers may not be able to deliver the funerals they have sold because they have to either transfer the business to another firm or it may force firms into administration and if that happens customers will likely lose out.""

200,000 funeral plans taken out every year 
Approximately 65 companies

Source: FCA/Fairer Finance
Whilst many of the larger, more reputable firms are expected to be granted authorisation by the FCA, others are unlikely to even apply for authorisation or will be turned down. If that happens they will be unable or not allowed to operate beyond 29 July.
The Funeral Planning Authority told Money Box it has been concerned about this situation for a number of years. ""We made our concerns known to both HM Treasury and the FCA,"" it said.
""Customers who took out plans in good faith are potentially being punished as a consequence of a Government policy, the approach taken to the implementation of that policy, and the lack of a properly thought through transition process that was designed to protect customers.""
The government said: ""Bringing pre-paid funeral plans into regulation will protect consumers from bad practice within the sector including by exposing any unsustainable business models and preventing problems from getting worse, and impacting more consumers.
""This follows extensive consultation and the Financial Conduct Authority is now taking proportionate steps to regulate these pre-paid plans. 
""The FCA's guidance is clear that firms not seeking authorisation should transfer their existing books of business or wind down in an orderly way before regulation starts.""
What customers can do
James Daley, the managing director and co-founder of consumer group Fairer Finance, has this advice for people worried about their funeral plans: ""If you're in the cooling off period [having very recently bought a plan] and you can cancel free of charge and you're with a smaller company you're worried about, then cancel because there's no cost.
""But if you're going to incur a cancellation fee, and some of these policies charge up to £1,300 in cancellation fees, my advice would be to sit tight for now.
""Rather than crystalising a loss it may be better to hold your nerve for a few weeks or a few months and see what this settlement ends up being.""

Walt Disney's CEO has apologised for his ""painful silence"" on a Florida sex education bill critics warn will isolate LGBT youth.
""You needed me to be a stronger ally in the fight for equal rights and I let you down. I am sorry,"" Bob Chapek told employees.
His comments come amid internal complaints that ""gay affection"" is routinely cut from some Disney films.
The so-called 'Don't Say Gay' bill is due to become law.
It bans discussions of sexual orientation and gender identity from kindergarten to third grade classes (aged 8-9) or when ""not age appropriate or developmentally appropriate for students in accordance with state standards"".
Formally known as the Parental Rights in Education bill, it also allows private citizens to sue and seek unspecified damages if they believe a school district has violated the law.
The White House has decried its passage as ""hateful legislation targeting vulnerable students"".
Florida lawmakers pass 'Don't Say Gay' bill
Biden blasts Florida 'Don't Say Gay' school bill
LGBT leaders at Disney have been clamouring for the company to speak out against the bill.
In a letter to Disney leadership, a copy of which was obtained by the BBC, LGBT employees at Pixar - the company's computer animation division - accused the parent company of stepping back from public debate around ""bigoted legislation"" while continuing to profit from the LGBT community.
They also levelled a more serious charge: that Disney has cut ""nearly every moment of overtly gay affection"" from its content ""regardless of when there is protest from both the creative teams and executive leadership at Pixar"". The company did not reply to BBC's requests for comment. 
On Friday, Mr Chapek told employees in a memo that he was wrong to have been silent on the 'Don't Say Gay' bill.
The admission came after he had claimed earlier in the week that he believed ""corporate statements do very little to change outcomes or minds"" and Disney's involvement would make it ""a political football"" - a statement that was denounced by animators on social media, who called it a ""momentous misstep"".

Amid the public criticism, Mr Chapek backtracked, telling shareholders on Wednesday that Disney had been ""opposed to the bill from the outset"" and he had phoned Florida Governor Ron DeSantis - who plans to approve the bill - to express his concerns.
Mr Chapek also pledged a $5m (£3.8m) donation to the Human Rights Campaign (HRC) LGBT advocacy group.
But the volte-face created even more fallout.
HRC turned down Disney's donation and called on the entertainment giant to take ""meaningful action"" against the bill. 
The company is a major tourism driver in the state, drawing some 58 million people per year to its flagship Walt Disney World Resort in Orlando. It also employs 77,000 Floridians.
And at a rally, Governor DeSantis told supporters the company has fallen for ""phony hysteria"" and wants to appease angry liberals.
His office confirmed to the BBC the governor took a call from Mr Chapek but intends to sign the bill.

Judge Amy Clark Meachum in court on Friday
A Texas judge has extended an order to prevent state officials from investigating allegations of so-called ""abuse"" against parents seeking gender-transitioning care for their children.
In February, officials declared some gender reassignment therapies ""child abuse"" under state law. 
Parents allowing them, could lose custody of their children under a directive from the Republican governor.
A district judge temporarily halted the plan Friday.
Judge Amy Clark Meachum ruled that the directive from Governor Greg Abbott violated the Texas state constitution.
As a result, investigations into parents currently under way are to stop, pending a trial into the matter.
The Texas attorney general's office filed a notice of intent to overturn Judge Meachum's ruling.  
A trial challenging the directive is due to take place in July. 
The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had sued Mr Abbott over the directive he had said was to prevent ""child abuse"".
LGBTQ rights advocates say the governor's directive unfairly criminalises transgender children and their families - and that the proposal to investigate them appears politically motivated, as part of Mr Abbott's gubernatorial re-election campaign this year. 
The directive had also urged teachers, doctors, and healthcare professionals to report any ""suspected abuse"", or face criminal penalties. 
Proponents of the directive say children are too young to make life-altering decisions about their bodies. 
However, medical experts in Texas say transgender surgical procedures are performed very rarely if ever on minors in the state. Treatment and therapies mainly consist of hormonal treatment (such as puberty blockers) and social transitioning (such as mental health counselling). 
They say that this kind of legislation only seeks to further discriminate and isolate trans youth - a population which already experiences disproportionate rates of suicide.  
Judge Meachum's order on Friday would stop nine investigations currently being carried out against families of transgender children, according to the Texas Tribune.
Amber Briggle, a Texas mother of a trans teen son, was informed that her family was under investigation in late February. In a statement posted to her blog, Ms Briggle said she felt Texas was ""attempting to rip our family apart because we love our children unconditionally"". 
""When we were notified of the allegations, it was as if the wind had been knocked out of us,"" she wrote. ""Raising a transgender child in Texas has been one long political emergency. It always seemed like this day would come."" 
Dozens of states are considering similar laws targeting trans youth. This week, Idaho lawmakers passed a similar bill that would make providing gender-transition care a felony with a life sentence. Parents could also be prosecuted if they leave the state to seek treatment for their children elsewhere. 
During the State of the Union, President Joe Biden called on Congress to pass the Equality Act, which would amend the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to prohibit discrimination on the basis of sex, sexual orientation and gender identity.

Six Nations: France edge past Wales to keep Grand Slam hopes alive
Guinness Six Nations 
Wales (9) 9
Pens: Biggar 3
France (10) 13
Tries: Jelonch Cons: Jaminet Pens: Jaminet 2
France kept alive their dreams of a first Grand Slam and Six Nations title since 2010 with a tense 13-9 win over Wales.
An Anthony Jelonch try and eight points from Melvyn Jaminet set up the victory.
Spirited Wales responded with three Dan Biggar penalties, but could not break down the French defence.
Fabien Galthie's side will aim to complete the Grand Slam against England next Saturday in Paris, while Wales host Italy in their final game.
It was a third defeat in four matches for Wayne Pivac's defending champions, alongside a narrow victory over Scotland.
Wales enjoyed second-half territory and possession dominance and managed to disrupt the possession of their opponents with Biggar and Taulupe Faletau producing inspired performances.
Wales' lacklustre attack could not crack a resolute French rearguard expertly organised by familiar face Shaun Edwards.
The France defence coach was part of Warren Gatland's Wales backroom team between 2008 and 2019 - a period that delivered four Six Nations titles, three Grand Slams and a World Cup semi-final appearance - before he joined Galthie's set-up.
The closest chance came when Wales centre Jonathan Davies just failed to hang onto a pass in the second half with the French line at his mercy.
Led by hooker and man-of-the-match Julian Marchand, France also excelled at the contact area as they took their winning sequence to seven games.
Their first Six Nations silverware in 12 years is now beckoning.
Rugby Union Daily podcast: France Grand Slam in sight after win over Wales
Relive the match and reaction as it happened: Wales v France
Friday night rugby was back for the first time in the Six Nations in Cardiff since 2017 with the Principality Stadium roof open.
The game was unusually played out in front of some empty seats, with 63,208 attending a stadium that holds 74,500.
Factors such as the game being held on Friday night and travel issues, Covid-19 concerns, Wales losing two out of their first three matches and ticket prices, some costing £100, all helped explain the 11,000 absent fans.
There had been talk of fewer French fans travelling, but that did not translate into the Principality Stadium cauldron with the thousands who had made the trip in fine voice.

Six Nations: 'Very Impressive' Biggar kept Wales in the game - Martin Johnson
Wales head coach Pivac made four changes with Cardiff duo Seb Davies, normally a lock, and Josh Navidi packing down in the back row instead of Ross Moriarty and Taine Basham.
Navidi demonstrated no rustiness despite having played only one game in five months since recovering from a shoulder injury.
Injured centre Nick Tompkins was replaced by Jonathan Davies, with prop Gareth Thomas preferred to Wyn Jones.
France made one change from the side that defeated Scotland as winger Gabin Villiere came in for Damian Penaud, who had tested positive for Covid-19.
Jaminet and Biggar exchanged early penalties before France showed their class with a flowing move for the only try, finished by flanker Jelonch following a scoring pass from Jaminet, who also converted.

'Fantastic try' - Jelonch goes over in the corner for France
Concussion controversy
Wales scrum-half Tomos Williams suffered a noticeable head injury in the move while attempting a tackle and tried to stumble to his feet on a couple of occasions.
Williams was permanently withdrawn with no need for a head injury assessment (HIA) and replaced by Kieran Hardy. 
The incident followed on from Wales being involved in a concussion controversy when prop Tomas Francis suffered a head injury against England 13 days previously. 
Francis was passed fit to face France despite warnings it would be a grave mistake to select him from Progressive Rugby, a lobby group concerned with safety of players.
Pivac insisted Wales had ""gone the extra mile"" in involving an independent concussion specialist surrounding Francis.
Wales bounced back into the match with a second Biggar penalty set up by a brilliant Faletau tackle on Jaminet.
The hosts were struggling to cope with Antoine Dupont's sniping, with prop Thomas stopping him on one occasion with a low tackle.
That resulted in the Ospreys front row going off for a head injury assessment, which he passed.
Biggar produced an excellent kicking game in the first half to give Wales attacking line-out options, which the home side could not completely capitalise on as France continued to frustrate at the breakdown.
The Wales captain slotted over a third penalty, awarded after an outstanding 50:22 kick had won crucial territory, as the home side battled back to a 10-9 deficit at half-time, with Faletau and lock Will Rowlands at the heart of the effort.
France prop Mohamed Haouas replaced Uini Atonio at the break before Jaminet extended the lead with a second penalty when Adam Beard was caught offside.
Another brilliant Biggar kick set up an attacking chance for Wales, but hooker Ryan Elias was held up over the line.
Wales, guided by Liam Williams, were gaining the upper hand in the aerial contest with both sides attempting high kicks to gain the ascendency in a cagey third quarter dominated by the whistle of referee Matthew Carley.

Another sublime Biggar chip kick fell into Faletau's hands, but the inside pass to Jonathan Davies went astray in the visiting 22 with the French line in sight.
Wales held territory and possession dominance, but were thwarted by France's efficiency at the contact area.
Pivac threw on wing Louis Rees-Zammit to replace Jonathan Davies with Josh Adams moving into midfield, while Gareth Anscombe replaced full-back Williams.
France took off captain Dupont with eight minutes remaining, but Les Bleus' breakdown dominance continued as Wales' pedestrian attacking game was picked off.
French fans were left singing into the Cardiff night as their side held on for victory.
Wales: L Williams; Cuthbert, Watkin, J Davies, Adams; Biggar (capt), T Williams; G Thomas, Elias, Francis, Rowlands, Beard, S Davies, Navidi, Faletau.

Crawley's hundred is his second in 19 Tests and first since 2020
First Test, Sir Vivian Richards Stadium, Antigua (day four):
England 311 & 217-1: Crawley 117*, Root 84*
West Indies 375: Bonner 123; Stokes 2-42, Leach 2-79
England lead by 153 runs
Scorecard
Zak Crawley hit his second Test hundred as England dominated West Indies on day four of the first Test to set up an outside chance of victory.
Crawley capitalised on a lifeless Antigua pitch to make an unbeaten 117, while captain Joe Root reached 84 not out at the close.
Having started the day behind the game and in the field, England were 217-1, leading by 153 runs, when rain brought an early finish.
Earlier they took just three deliveries to claim the final West Indies wicket as the hosts were dismissed for 375 with a first-innings lead of 64.
But, despite the early loss of debutant Alex Lees for six, Crawley and Root wiped out the deficit and batted England into the ascendancy with a mammoth unbeaten stand of 193.
The tourists, who have struggled for large parts of the Test, now look the more likely side to win.
However, the placid nature of pitch means any quest to bowl out West Indies on the final day will be a struggle.

England in West Indies 2022
Crawley doubted second England chance
England turn it around
In this three-match series, England are bidding to improve on a dreadful run which has seen them win just one of 14 Tests. 
The pitch is very helpful to batting and the opposition modest but this day revealed a hint of what England will hope for during this much-talked about red-ball reset.
What little danger there is in the surface - just a hint of uneven bounce - was neutered by 24-year-old Crawley and Root, 31, and afterwards they progressed calmly with ease.
The West Indies attack, without any express pace or world-class spin, was as blunted as England's had been across the previous two days.
Crawley and Root began to up their scoring late on, with England starting to look to set up a declaration.
The only wickets to fall all day were Jack Leach's lbw dismissal of West Indies number 11 Jayden Seales and the fall of Lees, who, as in the first innings, went lbw missing a straight ball from round the wicket by seamer Kemar Roach.
That suggests the draw is by far the most likely result. The rain late on did not help England's cause, in taking time out of the game.
Crawley comes good
There were 22 innings between Crawley's two Test hundreds
Crawley's classy knock is significant in the Test but even more so for England's future in this format.
Root's side are in desperate need of a settled top-order and this knock will secure the Kent opener's place for a long period.
Crawley dazzled when making his first Test hundred, a stunning 267 against Pakistan in 2020. This was a more measured knock where he clipped the ball smartly off his pads.
It could have been different - Crawley was given out lbw on nought but overturned the poor decision on review, with the ball comfortably missing leg. But with his captain a steady presence alongside him, Crawley did not offer another chance all day.
The right-hander had a barren spell after his maiden ton which led to him being dropped last year when averaging 11.14 across seven Tests.
Now, having regained his place in the third Ashes Test in December and impressing with 77 against Australia a game later, England will hope that that poor run is behind him.
'We'll have a good go' at the win - reaction
England's Zak Crawley, speaking to BT Sport: ""It's a very special feeling. It was tough year last year, I didn't think I would get this opportunity again.
""We certainly want to try and win it tomorrow, we'll have a good go in the morning, then try and bowl them out.""
BBC cricket correspondent Jonathan Agnew: ""It was certainly England's day. They began it under a lot of pressure having to try and make sure they weren't bowled out cheaply, To finish with a lead of 153 is a very good effort. 
""Both batsmen played very well. It was the sort of innings you want to see from Crawley, very patient. Root, as usual, was his busy self, albeit under strangulated conditions.""

The Queen will not attend next week's Commonwealth Service at Westminster Abbey, Buckingham Palace has said.
This is usually a significant occasion for the Queen and earlier in the week it had been hoped she would attend.
The decision is understood to be about concerns over her discomfort with travelling, rather than illness.
Prince Harry is also now not expected to come to the UK for a service of thanksgiving for Prince Philip, to be held later this month.
The message from Buckingham Palace does not mention the health of the 95-year-old Queen, but says not attending the Commonwealth Service on Monday was decided ""after discussing arrangements with the Royal Household"".
It is understood not to be related to an illness - but there have been concerns about the Queen's ability to travel and her mobility.
As she told defence staff in a meeting last month: ""As you can see, I can't move.""
Prince Harry to miss Philip service
The Queen, who recently recovered from Covid, is said to regret not being able to attend the event celebrating the Commonwealth, in what would have been one of her biggest public appearances of the year so far.
She has been carrying out diplomatic engagements at Windsor Castle, such as meeting the Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, and is expected to continue with such in-person audiences next week.

The Commonwealth Service was one of two major events in the Queen's diary this month - the other being the service of thanksgiving for her husband, Prince Philip.
But her grandson Prince Harry, the Duke of Sussex, will not travel to the UK for that service commemorating Prince Philip's life, to be held on 29 March.
A spokesperson said that Prince Harry hoped to visit his grandmother as soon as possible.
Prince Harry has been involved in a legal dispute over the provision of security when he visits from the United States.
At the annual service marking Commonwealth Day, the Queen will be represented by Prince Charles and other senior royals will be there, including Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge.
The monarch last missed the event in 2013, when recovering from a bout of gastroenteritis, but before that she had not been absent from the service for 20 years.
The Duke and Duchess of Gloucester are not attending, after the duke tested positive for Covid.
The service at Westminster Abbey, with a focus on the Queen's Platinum Jubilee, will be addressed by the former Archbishop of York, John Sentamu, and will hear music from Emeli Sandé and Mica Paris.

The sanctions will hit members of the Duma, the lower house of Russia's parliament
The UK government has imposed sanctions on hundreds of Russian parliamentarians as part of its response to the war in Ukraine.
Some 386 MPs who voted to recognise two rebel-held areas of eastern Ukraine as independent last month have been hit by asset freezes and UK travel bans.
The UK said their recognition of Luhansk and Donetsk gave Russia a ""pretext"" for its subsequent invasion.
Labour welcomed the move but said it should have happened ""weeks ago"".
It follows a similar move by the European Union, which announced sanctions against hundreds of Russian MPs last month. 
'Tighten the screw'
The UK signalled it would impose sanctions of its own last month, but said more time was needed to pass new legislation before it could happen.
The latest announcement means 400 of the 450 members of the Duma - the lower house of the Russian parliament - are now subject to British sanctions. They also prevent them from conducting business in the UK.
Downing Street declined to say whether any of the sanctioned politicians had any assets in the UK. 
Ministers are yet to also target members of the Federation Council, the Russian parliament's upper house, who voted for recognition. The Foreign Office signalled its intention to do so last month.
Meanwhile, No 10 said details of a UK ban on exporting luxury goods to Russia would be announced in the coming days.
The product ban is part of a series of additional trade sanctions announced by the G7 group of wealthy Western nations on Friday.
What sanctions are being imposed on Russia?

Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said the UK was targeting ""those complicit in Putin's illegal invasion of Ukraine and those who support this barbaric war"".
""We will not let up the pressure and will continue to tighten the screw on the Russian economy through sanctions,"" she added.
The move against Russian MPs follows sanctions on Russian banks, companies and oligarchs in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine last month. 
On Thursday the UK announced sanctions on a further seven Russian oligarchs, including Chelsea FC owner Roman Abramovich.
The UK government says it means 18 Russian oligarchs, worth a combined £30bn, have been sanctioned since the Russian invasion began. 
Russia's Duma approved ""friendship treaties"" with Luhansk and Donetsk at a vote on 22 February
Ministers have been coming under mounting pressure from opposition parties to increase both the speed and scale of sanctions in recent weeks. 
Labour's shadow foreign secretary David Lammy said the latest sanctions against Duma members were welcome, but ""should have happened weeks ago"".
Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesperson Layla Moran also backed the move, but said the UK had been ""moving at a snail's pace"".
The government has also faced criticism over its response to the refugee crisis, amid accusations the process to apply for visas is slow and bureaucratic. 
The United Nations said more than 2.5 million people have now fled Ukraine, but as of Thursday morning the UK had issued 1,305 visas, Home Office Minister Baroness Williams of Trafford said on Friday. 
The government has announced plans to allow Ukrainians with family in the UK to apply for visas online, without having to visit a visa centre in-person.
Details of a second scheme allowing individuals and businesses to sponsor refugee visas are set to be confirmed on Monday, having originally been announced on 1 March.

A sub-variant of Omicron, called BA.2, is now thought to be the most common strain in most of the UK.
The ONS says it's too early to say what's behind the rise in cases.
But some scientists believe the BA.2 variant's increased transmissibility, external, recent easing of restrictions and waning immunity from the vaccines could all be factors.
What is BA.2?
Asked if there were worries about sub-variants Health Secretary Sajid Javid said the government had ""no concerns at all"".
He said Omicron had been the last variant to be considered of concern but that the country had ""successfully navigated"" it, but he said the government continued to monitor the situation ""very carefully"".
""There's a world-class surveillance system in place, and whilst in some regions we have seen a modest rise in infections, overall case numbers are still very low and hospitalisation numbers are way below their peak,"" he said.
The ONS infection survey, external, which tests thousands of people randomly in households across the UK, estimates that 2.6 million people would have tested positive in the week ending 5 March - up from 2.4 million the previous week - roughly one in 27.
There were also rises across the four UK nations:
in Northern Ireland, up from 5.8% testing positive to 7.8% (one in 13 people)
in Scotland, up from 5.3% testing positive to 5.7% (one in 18)
in England, up from 3.6% testing positive last week to 3.8% (one in 25)
in Wales, up from 3.1% testing positive to 3.2% (one in 30 people)
Older age groups are now experiencing rising levels of infection with 2.9% of over-70s testing positive in England - the highest level since mid-January.
An extra vaccine booster is being offered this spring to people over 75, care-home residents and the most vulnerable over-12s to top up their protection.
These groups will be invited to have a jab six months after their most recent vaccination. 
'Critical booster'
The booster vaccines offer good long-term protection against severe disease and death from Covid, but they provide little protection against infection.
Even a small drop-off in vaccine immunity over time could have a large impact, increasing the numbers of at-risk people needing hospital treatment.
NHS England says the spring booster rollout will begin in April - with the exception of a small number of extremely vulnerable people, who will be invited in late March - with no plans to bring it forward.
In Scotland, additional booster doses started being given to the most vulnerable this week.
Linda Bauld, professor of public health at the University of Edinburgh, said it would be ""great"" to accelerate the booster programme ""to keep numbers in hospital low"" and also to make sure people continued to be treated for other health issues, after very long waits. 
""We have always expected there to be new infections as we opened up,"" Prof Bauld said.
""We have decoupled the worst health harms of Covid due to vaccines, but getting the further booster delivered in March and April is going to be critical.""
Hospital admissions
The number of people with Covid in Scottish hospitals is at its highest level for 13 months. There were 1,636 patients in hospital on Wednesday, which is higher than the peak during the Omicron wave in January.
Health boards said that while far fewer people needed intensive care, the large numbers of Covid patients were affecting availability of beds and other services.
After falling steadily since January, official data shows Covid hospital admissions, external have also been going up gradually in the rest of the UK - with England showing the most obvious rise since the end of February. In Wales, admissions are staying relatively stable.
Nearly 12,000 people are in UK hospitals with a positive test for Covid but data suggests most of those patients are being treated for something else rather than Covid-19 itself.
Earlier this week, Dr Jenny Harries, chief executive of the UK Health Security Agency, said the presence of the BA.2 sub-lineage of the Omicron variant and slight increase in infections in over-55s in England ""show the pandemic is not over"".
""We can expect to see Covid circulating at high levels,"" Dr Harries said.
""Vaccination remains the best way to protect us all from severe disease and hospitalisation due to Covid-19 infection. 
""We urge you to come forward for your primary or booster doses straight away if you have not already done so.""

296,296,"Under threat of Russian bombs, Lviv hides away its priceless heritage","Sat, 12 Mar 2022 00:25:31 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-60707531,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-60707531?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,The picturesque western city of Lviv is racing to protect is cultural and religious artefacts.,"Under threat of Russian bombs, Lviv hides away its priceless heritage
Empty plinths and cabinets now line the large rooms of the National Museum of Lviv
In one room of the National Museum of Lviv, an enormous scaffold is bare. In another, brackets hang loosely from the walls. Plinths sit empty along the corridors and wooden pallets and cardboard boxes are strewn on the floors. The staff used whatever they could to pack away the museum's priceless artefacts in a hurry.
As Russian shelling has devastated other parts of Ukraine, the picturesque western city of Lviv has been left untouched, so far. But it is bracing for war. Some preparations you can see in the open - the checkpoints on main roads and the soldiers on the streets - but some are taking place behind closed doors.
In Lviv's galleries, museums and churches, a huge operation is under way to safeguard the city's cultural heritage. Thousands of artworks and artefacts have been carefully removed and taken to secret underground locations, or down to basement storage rooms.
The climate-controlled cabinets in Lviv's national museum now sit empty, their treasures hidden underground
Ihor Kozhan, the director of the National Museum of Lviv - the largest art museum in Ukraine - took the BBC on a tour of its now empty rooms, which looked as though they had been looted. Climate-controlled display cases, usually home to artworks, icons and manuscripts dating as far back as the 14th Century, were bare. 
Nearly every one of the 1,500 artefacts on display has now been removed from the museum. The other 97% of the collection - 180,000 pieces in total - was already in storage in some form. 
""Everything, everything is gone,"" Kozhan said.
""It is sad for me to be in these empty rooms,"" said Ihor Kozhan, the director of the museum
Despite overseeing the operation, Kozhan was amazed by the speed with which the 17th-century Bohorodchany Iconostasis - a grouping of religions paintings measuring 10m by 8m and one of the museum's most valuable pieces - had been dismantled by his team. It had taken six months to hang, piece by piece, he said, and less than six days to pull down from its scaffold and store away.
Constructed and painted over seven years beginning in 1698, the iconostasis represents the high watermark of the work of the icon painter Yov Kondzelevych. It has been in Lviv since 1924, then a Polish city, brought there by an archbishop of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church.  
It was dismantled and hidden from the Nazis in 1939, forbidden from display during the Soviet era, painstakingly restored in 2006, and now dismantled once more.

There was no plan in place for the evacuation of the museum's artefacts before the invasion began two weeks ago, Kozhan said - not even after Russia began months ago to mass troops along Ukraine's borders. 
""There was no plan because no one could imagine this would happen,"" he said. ""We had no plan at all - not before the war, not even in December. You must understand, we did not believe it could come to this.""
Territorial defence soldiers gathered outside a Lviv church where the statutes have been wrapped in protective fabric
Around Lviv, cultural and religious officials are running complex operations to wrap up statues, seal off stained glass windows and spirit away sacred artefacts. 
In the city's main square, fountains with sculptures of Greek gods and goddesses have been wrapped in flame-retardant fabric and covered with scaffolds to protect them from falling masonry.
""At first it was a bit chaotic but it has become more organised,"" said Liliya Onischenko, the head of Lviv's city council heritage protection office.
""We are photographing everything before we take it away and we are photographing all the pieces in their hidden places,"" she said
Greek gods and goddesses on fountains in Lviv's town square have been wrapped and scaffolded
Onischenko said the priority was protecting the stained glass windows in the city's historical old town, a Unesco world heritage site whose architecture was built over centuries by different nationalities - Poles, Austrians, Hungarians, Germans, Armenians - as the region changed hands.
At the Armenian cathedral, a prized 15th-Century wooden sculpture of Christ on the cross was removed for the first time since World War Two and taken to a secret, safe place. 
Other artefacts besides the sculpture have been removed, the deacon, Armen Hakopian said, but he would not elaborate. ""What needed to be taken out was taken out,"" he said, with a smile.
The windows along the side of the 850-year-old Armenian cathedral are plain, because the original stained glass was blown out in the 1940s by German bombing. But above, stained glass remains in the cupola and the high parts of the church.

The institutions of Lviv have had the benefit of time to prepare. And they may yet escape the violence. But there are grave fears for the cultural, religious and architectural treasures in the parts of Ukraine under attack.
There has already been significant damage. The stained glass windows and nave of the assumption cathedral in Kharkiv were damaged by Russian shelling. Russian troops have reportedly destroyed a 19th-century wooden church in the village of Viazivka in Zhytomyr. And a museum in Ivankiv, north of Kyiv, was razed, destroying 25 works by the Ukrainian folk artist Maria Prymachenko.

Ihor Kozhan, the national museum director, said he feared that destroying Ukraine's cultural fabric was part of Russia's goal, and he feared greatly for Lviv.
""If the same damage is done here as in Kharkiv, Mariupol, it would be a terrible tragedy,"" he said. 
""This is a place of historical memory. The museums here hold the history of the nation. They give us an understanding of who we were, who we are, and who we will be.
""Russia wants to destroy that.""
A statue, too heavy to move underground, lies on the floor of the museum's atrium
The job of emptying the national museum was virtually complete by Wednesday - only a few cardboard boxes of manuscripts were left, near the doors, alongside a sculpture lying on the floor - one of several too heavy to move that will be protected in other ways. 
The artefacts that have been moved underground are on a clock - too long there without adequate climate control and they would begin to degrade, Kozhan said. 
And they would not probably not survive a direct hit, he said, with a long sigh, because the bunkers are not designed to withstand powerful bombs.

""I hope we can bring them up soon,"" he said. ""It is difficult for me to be here in these empty rooms and hallways. We could have walked the whole day here together looking at our history and our art.""
Asked to estimate the total value of the museum's works, Kozhan declined.
""Of course there is no number,"" he said. 
""If these things are destroyed they cannot be remade.""

Correction 8 April 2022: This article has been amended after we mistakenly stated Lviv was part of Ukraine in 1924. It was in fact a Polish city at that time.

Wagner member in the Donbas region in 2014/15
Social media channels and private messaging groups are being used in Russia to recruit a new brigade of mercenaries to fight in Ukraine alongside the army, the BBC has learned. 
The BBC has spoken to a serving mercenary and a former fighter with close links to one of Russia's leading mercenary organisations, who have shared details of the recruitment campaign.
The serving mercenary said many veterans of the secretive Wagner organisation were contacted on a private Telegram group a few weeks before the start of the war. They were invited to a ""picnic in Ukraine"", with references to tasting ""Salo"", a pork fat traditionally eaten in Ukraine. 
The message appeals to ""those with criminal records, debts, banned from mercenary groups or without an external passport"" to apply. The message also included that ""those from the Russian-occupied areas of Luhansk and Donetsk republics and Crimea - cordially invited"". 
Wagner in eastern Ukraine, 2014/15
The Wagner group is one of the most secretive organisations in Russia. Officially, it doesn't exist - serving as a mercenary is against Russian and international law. But up to 10,000 operatives are believed to have taken at least one contract with Wagner over the past seven years.
The serving mercenary who spoke to the BBC said new recruits are being placed in units under the command of officers from the GRU, the Russian military intelligence unit of the ministry of defence.
He stressed that the recruitment policy had changed, and fewer restrictions were applied. ""They are recruiting anyone and everyone,"" he said, unhappy with what he described as the lower professionalism of the new fighters.
He said the new units being recruited are no longer referred to as Wagner, but new names - such as The Hawks - were being used.

In 2021, the BBC gained access to an electronic tablet left behind by a Wagner fighter in Libya
This seems to be part of a recent tendency to steer away from the Wagner group's reputation, as ""the brand is tainted"", says Candace Rondeaux, professor of Russian, Eurasian and Eastern European studies at Arizona State University. 
Wagner has faced repeated accusations of human rights abuses and war crimes in its operations in Syria and Libya. 
The mercenary sources who spoke to the BBC, said the recruits are trained at the Wagner base in Mol'kino in southern Russia, next to a Russian army base.
As well as the private messaging groups, there has also been a public campaign in Russia to recruit mercenaries. 
On the Russian social media platform VK, a page that describes itself as a specialist in security activities, posted an advert during the first week of the invasion calling for ""security guards"" from other former Soviet Union countries to apply for ""the near abroad"". Military experts have said this is a reference to Ukraine. 
Previously, a criminal record was a block for those wanting to join the mercenaries. Also restrictions were placed on anyone born outside Russia because of doubts around loyalty. 
Translated advert for mercenaries on the VK social media site
There is a ""high demand on fighters"" and to make a difference on the ground ""they're going to need thousands of mercenaries"", says Jason Blazakis, senior research fellow at the Soufan Centre, a US-based security think tank.
On Friday, the Russian defence minister Sergei Shoigu said that 16,000 fighters from the Middle East had volunteered to fight with the Russian army. The Russian president Vladimir Putin gave orders allowing fighters from the Middle East to be deployed in the war.
It has been reported that up to 400 fighters from the Wagner group have been in Ukraine.
The Wagner group was first identified in 2014, when it was backing pro-Russian separatists in the conflict in eastern Ukraine. 
The serving Wagner fighter explained that in the first days of the invasion of Ukraine he was sent to the country's second city, Kharkiv, where he said his unit successfully completed a mission without revealing what it was.
""We were then paid $2,100 (£1,600) for a month's work and returned home to Russia,"" he told the BBC.

Blazakis describes using mercenaries as a ""sign of desperation"" to keep the Russian public's support. Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine has stirred several protests in Russia. Thousands have been arrested. Blazakis added that using mercenaries allows the Kremlin to ""keep the death toll down because mercenaries are used like cannon fodder"". 
Moscow has always denied any links with mercenary groups. 
The BBC asked the Russian ministry of defence whether the base in Mol'kino was being used to recruit additional forces for what the Russian authorities call ""a special military operation in Ukraine''. No response was received.

Russian state TV has been showing sites which officials say are being used to develop bioweapons
Russia has claimed without any evidence that biological weapons are being developed in laboratories in Ukraine with support from the United States.
It says material is being destroyed to conceal the country's weapons programme, but the US says this is ""total nonsense"" and that Russia is inventing false narratives to justify its actions in Ukraine.
No evidence: US funds biological weapons research in Ukraine
Russia has accused the US and Ukraine of working with ""pathogens of dangerous infections"" in 30 laboratories across the country. Pathogens are microorganisms that can cause disease.
Ukraine has dozens of public health laboratories that work to research and mitigate the threats of dangerous diseases.
Some of these labs receive financial and other support from the US, the European Union and the World Health Organization (WHO) - as is the case in many other countries.
Despite Russian claims that these are ""secret"" labs, details of US involvement can be found on the US embassy's website. 
The US says it funds work in Ukrainian labs to tackle dangerous diseases
Additionally, the US set up its ""Biological Threat Reduction Program, external"" in the 1990s following the fall of the Soviet Union to reduce the risk from biological weapons that had been left behind in countries including Ukraine.
Under this programme certain labs receive funding from the US for modernisation and equipment, but are managed locally, not by the US.
The US Department of Defense has been working in partnership with Ukraine's Ministry of Health since 2005, external to improve the country's public health laboratories. 
The US provides technical support and, according to the US Embassy in Ukraine, ""works with partner countries to counter the threat of outbreaks (intentional, accidental or natural) of the world's most dangerous infectious diseases"".
There is no evidence that they work to produce biological weapons. In January, the US said its programme does the opposite, external and in fact aims to ""reduce the threat of biological weapons proliferation"".
There have been similar unsubstantiated claims by Russia in the past, external about US-backed biolabs operating in its neighbouring countries.

The BBC's Steve Rosenberg investigates Russian disinformation and the Georgian 'lab of death'
In 2018, there were reports in Russian state media that untested drugs were given to citizens at a lab funded by the US in neighbouring Georgia.
The BBC visited the site and spoke to individuals involved in the research and found no evidence to support the claims.
What are chemical weapons and could Russia use them?
No evidence: Ukraine destroyed pathogens to hide illegal research
Russian officials have also claimed Ukraine has tried to conceal evidence of prohibited activities. 
Gen Igor Kirillov said documents uncovered by the Russian military in Ukraine on 24 February - the day the Russian invasion started - ""show that the Ministry of Health of Ukraine has set the task of completely destroying bio-agents in laboratories"".
""The Pentagon knows that if these documents fall into the hands of Russian experts, then it's highly likely that Ukraine and the United States will be found to have violated the Convention on the Prohibition of Biological and Toxin Weapons,"" he said.
One of the documents Russian officials say they recovered from Ukraine
BBC News has been unable to independently verify the documents cited by General Kirillov.
The WHO has told BBC News that it had advised Ukraine to destroy high-threat pathogens stored at the country's public health labs to prevent ""any potential spills"" that would spread disease among the population.  
The agency said it had collaborated with Ukrainian public health labs for several years to enhance biosafety and biosecurity and help prevent ""accidental or deliberate release of pathogens"". 
The WHO did not say when the recommendation had been made nor whether it was followed. It also did not provide details of the kind of pathogens stored at Ukrainian labs. However, the US said Ukraine's health ministry had ordered the ""safe and secure disposal of samples"" after Russia's invasion to limit the risk in the event of a Russian military attack.
""There are no indications that Ukrainian labs have been involved in any nefarious activity, or any research or development in contravention of the Biological Weapons Convention,"" says Filippa Lentzos, a biosecurity expert at King's College London.
She adds that pathogens stored at biological labs are simply bacteria and viruses, and ""not blueprints or components of biological weapons"".
""The reason they are kept in secure facilities is for bio-safety, so people don't make themselves sick by getting access to them.""
The documents listing destroyed pathogens which Russian officials have presented as evidence of nefarious activity at several Ukrainian labs contain no highly dangerous pathogens, microbiologist Yevgeny Levitin told Sibir Realii, a regional outlet of Radio Liberty, external. 
""Everything listed in the published documents are only notional pathogens, with the exception of Clostridium diphtheriae, but even that is not considered highly hazardous"".
False: A high number of pathogens indicates weapons research
Gen Kirillov also claimed that the highly militarised nature of the work at Ukrainian bio-labs is confirmed by ""excess number of bio-pathogens"" stored there.
But Dr Lentzos says this argument does not follow any logical science. ""The numbers don't really matter, you can easily grow pathogens in a lab"" starting from a small sample.
""These labs publish in openly available literature. They collaborate on many public health projects with global partners,"" says Brett Edwards, a senior lecturer in security and public policy at the University of Bath.
""Devoting considerable sums of money and significant resources to conducting bioweapons research makes no strategic sense for  Ukraine given the difficulty in using them in a conflict,"" argues Dan Kaszeta, a former US serviceman and expert on defence against biological weapons. 
""Conventional warfare weapons are much easier and more effective to use for countries like Ukraine,"" he said.
Where else have these claims been repeated?
Moscow's claims about the Ukrainian labs were echoed by China this week, with foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian accusing the US of using the facilities to ""conduct bio-military plans"", external.
Similar accusations have also been made by Iranian and Syrian officials. 
Although the allegations have been echoed elsewhere, ""most of the Russian messaging is meant to target their own population"", according to Milton Leitenberg, a senior research associate at the Center for International and Security Studies at the University of Maryland (CISSM).
He said the claims were meant to ""muddy up the minds of Russian citizens"" who did not know they were false and had no access to alternative information.

Fabian at work on his spamming website
A Norwegian computer expert has created a website enabling anyone to send an email about the war in Ukraine to up to 150 Russian email addresses at a time, so that Russian people have a chance to hear the truth their government is hiding.
All over Russia email inboxes are pinging.
Millions of messages are being received with the same intriguing subject Ya vam ne vrag - I am not your enemy.
The message appears in Russian with an English translation and it begins: ""Dear friend, I am writing to you to express my concern for the secure future of our children on this planet. Most of the world has condemned Putin's invasion of Ukraine.""
The lengthy email goes on to implore Russian people to reject the war in Ukraine and seek the truth about the invasion from non-state news services.
In just a few days, more than 22 million of these emails landed in Russian inboxes, and they're being sent by volunteers around the world, who are donating their time and email addresses to the cause.
It's one of a growing number of unusual ways that hackers, activists and every day people around the world are trying to reach out to Russian people online to circumvent media blocks and censorship. One Polish Twitter user's idea to post reviews, external talking about the war to Russian businesses on Google and Yandex went viral.
Elsewhere hacker groups claim to have defaced Russian news websites with messages to Russian people to ""stop Putin"".
But the spam email campaign created by a small team in Norway seems to have caught the imagination of thousands of people searching for ways to help Russians learn about the war.

""During the Second World War, and in earlier wars, people flew over Germany with leaflets and dropped them out. This is just a more modern way of trying to get people to open their eyes,"" says Fabian, who came up with the idea.
The 50-year-old Norwegian, who runs a computer network business, doesn't want his surname to be published for fear of retaliation from the Russian authorities. He says he felt compelled to do something after becoming increasingly anxious about the possibility of World War Three.
People power
His website, which the BBC is not naming, is circumventing Russian censorship through a mix of clever computing and people power. The system allows people to send his templated message to dozens of Russian email addresses at once, and he estimates that tens of thousands of volunteers have done this since the website went live.
Fabian built it with five colleagues, who worked flat-out last weekend to get the job done. They started by trawling the internet for known Russian email addresses and compiled a list of 90 million accounts they believe are active. He says the strength of the system lies in getting volunteers to use their own email accounts instead of bulk-messaging the email addresses using spam software.
Users can choose to contact from one to 150 Russian people. Then, with a click, the volunteer's default email client (Outlook or Gmail, for example) is loaded up with the unique email addresses, subject and body text ready to send.
People are also able to personalise the contents too, to increase the chances of getting their email read. 
Some foreign news websites are still accessible from Russia, but the BBC is blocked
There are two reasons, says Fabian, for using people's personal email accounts: the emails get through email spam filters if they are sent from real accounts, and in small numbers. 
""But also, people can actually receive replies from Russians and engage with them and have conversations about the war.""
Fabian says some accounts will be less active than others and in some cases the email may end up in the junk mail folder. But many of the messages are being read, he says, and some Russians are replying. 
Replying Russians
Alex, also in Norway, was asked to test the system by Fabian's team, but has kept sending emails since.
""I've sent around 500 emails so far and got around 20 replies within a day, so I'm hoping for more,"" he says. ""Most of the replies are people asking me to take them off my mailing list but I got talking to a 35-year-old woman from St Petersburg. She told me she wasn't sure what was going on in the conflict and wanted to know more. She said there was a lack of news coming out of Europe and she wanted to read about it all but didn't know how to get through the blocks on websites.""
Alex then explained how she could sidestep Russia's internet blocks
""I think I've got a friend in her now!"" he says.
Another 18-year-old volunteer shared the reply she received from an unknown Russian. The message argued strongly that she was wrong and it was Ukraine that was killing innocent people which is why ""this special operation is a necessary measure"".   
Fabian says his team are constantly tweaking the text and subject of their email template to evade email spam filters, and hope many of the 90 million email addresses will eventually receive the message. If they run out of emails to try he says the team will find more.
They have also had to fend off attacks from unknown hackers trying to bring the site down.
'Not propaganda'
Fabian argues that what he is doing is ""not propaganda"". Asked how he feels about spamming millions of people, he replies that the intrusion is justified because the stakes are so high.
Is he putting unsuspecting recipients in danger?
""You can't charge the recipient of the email. They're served our email without being able to consent to it, so it's kind of involuntarily receiving a leaflet. It's literally a war. You have to stand up for what you believe in. And I believe in this.""

300,300,What sanctions are being imposed on Russia over Ukraine invasion?,"Fri, 11 Mar 2022 15:12:07 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-60125659,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-60125659?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,Western nations have imposed severe sanctions on Russia over its invasion of Ukraine.,"What are the sanctions on Russia and have they affected its economy?
The US, UK and EU have announced new sanctions on Russia, two years after its invasion of Ukraine.
The measures also marked a week since the death in custody of opposition leader Alexei Navalny.
What are sanctions?
Sanctions are penalties imposed by one country on another, to stop them acting aggressively or breaking international law.
They are among the toughest measures nations can take, short of going to war. 
What are the latest sanctions on Russia?
Announcing 500 new sanctions against Russia, US President Joe Biden said they would target Russia's war machine. Export restrictions will be imposed on nearly 100 firms or individuals.
President Biden said the measures would also target people connected with the imprisonment of Mr Navalny, who died in an Arctic penal camp. 
The UK has frozen the assets of six bosses at the prison and banned them from travelling to the UK. 
The UK has also imposed new bans on Russian metal, diamond and energy exports.
The EU has announced sanctions on 200 organisations and people, external which it says are helping Russia acquire weapons, or taking Ukrainian children from their homes. 
The sanctions include companies and individuals involved in shipping North Korean armaments to Russia.
Alexei Navalny: What we know about his death 
What other sanctions have been imposed on Russia?
Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the US, UK and EU, along with countries including Australia, Canada and Japan, have imposed more than 16,500 sanctions on Russia, external.
Their main target has been Russia's money.
Foreign currency reserves worth $350bn (£276bn) - about half its total reserves - were frozen.
About 70% of the assets of Russian banks, external were also frozen, the EU says, and some were excluded from Swift, a high-speed messaging service for financial institutions.
Western nations have also:
banned exports of technology Russia might use for making weapons
banned imports of gold and diamonds from Russia 
banned flights from Russia
sanctioned oligarchs - the wealthy business people linked with the Kremlin  - and impounded their yachts
Roman Abramovich, former owner of Chelsea FC, is one oligarch who has been sanctioned
Russia's oil industry has been another major target.
The US and UK banned Russian oil and natural gas. The EU has banned seaborne crude imports.
The G7 - an organisation of the world's seven largest ""advanced"" economies - has imposed a maximum price of $60 (£47) a barrel, external on Russian crude oil, to try to reduce its earnings.
Which Western companies have left Russia?
Hundreds of major firms, including McDonald's, Coca-Cola, Starbucks and Heineken, have stopped selling and making goods in Russia. 
However, some still do business in Russia. 
PepsiCo, for example, has been accused of continuing to sell food products in Russia. And the BBC discovered that US cosmetics firm Avon was making goods in a factory near Moscow.
How has Russia evaded sanctions?
President Vladimir Putin has claimed European sanctions have done Russia no harm, saying: ""We have growth, and they have decline."", external
Russia has managed to sell oil abroad for more than the G7's price cap, external, according to the Atlantic Council, a US think tank. It says a ""shadow fleet"" of about 1,000 tankers is used to ship it, external.
The International Energy Agency says Russia is still exporting 8.3 million barrels of oil a day, external - having increased supplies to India and China.
Russia is also able to import many sanctioned Western goods, external by buying them through countries such as Georgia, Belarus and Kazakhstan, according to researchers at King's College London. 
China has been a vital supplier of alternative hi-tech products to those produced in the West, says Dr Maria Snegovaya from the US think tank, the Center for Strategic and International Studies.
""China sells it chips and other components it needs to for keep its military production going,"" she says. ""Russia wouldn't be able to pull that off without China's help.""

What support is China giving Russia? 
What impact have sanctions had on Russia's economy?
In 2022, the first year of the war, Russia's economy shrank by 2.1%, external, according to the International Monetary Fund.
However, it estimates that Russia's economy grew by 2.2% in 2023 and predicts growth of 1.1% in 2024.
Nevertheless, the US Treasury claims sanctions are damaging Russia, having cut 5% from the economic growth, external it might have had over the past two years.
But Dr Snegovaya suggests: ""Sanctions have not made waging this war sufficiently costly for Russia, and that means it can continue with it for some time to come"".
The US Treasury also says that the war in Ukraine and sanctions have led more than a million people, external - many of them young and highly educated - to leave Russia. 
Russia's government has also been slashing health spending to fund the war in Ukraine, according to the UK's Ministry of Defence, external. 
""This mainly hits people in rural areas,"" says James Nixey of foreign affairs think tank Chatham House. ""The government makes cuts there rather than in the major cities, where they might cause uprisings.""

A pregnant woman photographed escaping from the wreckage of a hospital bombed by Russia has given birth to a daughter, reports say.
The image of heavily-pregnant Mariana Vishegirskaya, her face bloodied, descending rubble-strewn steps was widely shared amid outrage at the attack, which killed three people.
She gave birth the following day, her niece in Turkey told local media.
Ukraine's ambassador to the UN said the baby had been named Veronika.
Sergiy Kyslytsya, who held up a picture of Ms Vishegirskaya and her newborn daughter during remarks at the UN, hit out at ""Russian lies"" about her in the aftermath of the attack.
Ms Vishegirskaya became the subject of a Russian disinformation campaign after the bombing.
The Russian embassy in the UK tweeted a conspiracy theory that Ms Vishegirskaya was an actress and the aftermath of the attack had been staged.
However, the BBC's disinformation team found evidence which contradicted the unfounded claims, including that she had somehow pretended to be several women photographed at the scene.
Twitter later removed the Russian embassy's tweets, saying they violated rules ""related to the denial of violent events"".
Further claims circulating online suggested that Ms Vishegirskaya was not even pregnant. However, the beauty blogger revealed she was pregnant in January to her followers - weeks before the invasion - and later asked them if whether they thought she would have a girl or a boy.

Mr Kyslytsya produced the photo of Ms Vishegirskaya on Friday afternoon, telling those assembled he wanted to share ""very good news"". 
""Miss Mariana, the pregnant woman gave birth to a healthy daughter last night. Her name is Veronika. Here she is with her father. No matter what the Russian lies are about herself, her family, and the incident,"" he said.
He also said that more than 1,500 civilians had been killed by Russia in Mariupol, which has been without water or electricity for days after being surrounded by Russian forces and where several attempts to establish evacuation corridors had failed. Ukraine has said three people, including a child, had been killed in the hospital strike alone.
""For the first time since World War Two people are being buried in mass graves in Ukrainian cities,"" Mr Kyslytsya said.
Numerous tech companies have begun blocking Russian state media channels in an attempt to tackle disinformation. 
On Friday, YouTube became the latest tech giant to block channels associated with Russian state-funded media. The video streaming service said it had a policy ""prohibit content denying, minimizing or trivializing well-documented violent events"".

The BBC's Sarah Rainsford sent this picture of a bombed building in Dnipro
On day 16 of the invasion, Russian forces widened their attacks, targeting several Ukrainian cities that had previously escaped the worst of the onslaught.
The central city of Dnipro was among those directly targeted, with air strikes hitting a shoe factory, an apartment block and a nursery. 
The BBC's Sarah Rainsford, reporting from the city, said it had previously been something of a safe haven for people fleeing cities under sustained Russian attack. 
The mayor of Lutsk, in the west of the country, said air strikes on a military airfield there killed at least four Ukrainian soldiers. 
Another airfield was hit in the southwestern city of Ivano-Frankivsk.
Meanwhile, Russian President Vladimir Putin gave the go-ahead for foreign volunteers to fight against Ukrainian forces.
Speaking at a Russian security council meeting, he said those who wanted to volunteer to fight with Russia-backed rebels in eastern Ukraine should be allowed to.
Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu said there were 16,000 volunteers in the Middle East ready to fight alongside Russia-backed forces. 
US officials said these could include Syrians skilled in urban combat. But analysts have questioned how useful such fighters would be to Russia, with one saying they may just become ""cannon fodder"".

Watch: President Zelensky says Ukraine is 'on the way to victory'
Foreign fighters, including former and current British army personnel, have also been arriving in Ukraine to fight for the government in Kyiv.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said recently that 16,000 foreigners had volunteered for the cause, part of what he called an ""international legion"".
Mr Zelensky responded to Mr Putin's latest comments by saying ""thugs from Syria"" would be coming to kill people ""in a foreign land"".
In a defiant address, he said his country would be victorious in the war with Russia.
Large Russian convoy near Kyiv redeploys
At the same time, fears grew of a possible renewed push towards Kyiv after satellite images taken by a US firm of a large Russian military convoy near the capital showed it had ""largely dispersed and redeployed"".
The convoy was last seen near Antonov Airport, north-west of Kyiv.
The firm that took the photos, Maxar Technologies, said parts of the convoy were in positions in surrounding towns.
Other parts are further north, with artillery now in firing positions.
Meanwhile in Kyiv itself barricades are being strengthened and defences set up in preparation for an assault on the city, our correspondent in the city Jeremy Bowen writes.
Control of the city will be crucial to any political outcome to the war and it is certain that Mr Putin and his generals are reassessing, regrouping and will not accept defeat

Death of Russian general confirmed
Ukraine's military says Russian Maj Gen Andrei Kolesnikov has been killed
Western officials have confirmed that a third Russian major general has been killed in Ukraine, adding that he was from Russia's eastern military district.
Officials didn't name the general, but earlier Ukraine's military said Maj Gen Andrei Kolesnikov, commander of the 29th army of Russia's eastern district, had been killed.
Analysts have previously said that the presence of high-ranking military figures on or near the battlefield could be a sign that Russia's operations are not going to plan.
Mystery Ukraine war drone crashes in Croatia
The debris suggests it was a Soviet-era drone used by the Ukrainian military
People in Croatia's capital, Zagreb, awoke on Friday to find that a military drone had crashed in the city overnight.
There was an explosion in the south-western Jarun district shortly after 23:00 (22:00 GMT). Residents found a crater and wreckage scattered close to student accommodation.
Zagreb's mayor, Tomislav Tomasevic, said ""it's amazing that no-one was injured"".
Croatia's president there was nothing to indicate the country was targeted.
Witness reports suggested the only person hurt was a man who fell off his bicycle as the drone hit the ground.

Children evacuated from an orphanage are led to safety
Traffickers are targeting parentless children on the Ukraine-Poland border, says a group evacuating orphanages in the war zone.
A team of US military veterans is helping to organise safe passage for the estimated 200,000 children in Ukraine's orphanages and foster homes. 
But they say thousands are unaccounted for and fear some may already have fallen prey to people traffickers.
Kyiv says it is tightening procedures for vulnerable children.

Tens of thousands of children in Ukrainian state care are in desperate need to get out of the country
Aerial Recovery, a team of former US military veterans who are assisting vulnerable people fleeing the crisis, is working with the Ukrainian authorities to establish a system that will make it easier to keep tabs on the country's parentless children. 
""The government doesn't really have the capacity to deal with the problem,"" says Jeremy Locke, the team's chief of operations.
The team is working with Salam, a charity which helps refugees. It told the BBC that children dropped at the Ukraine-Poland border by well-meaning organisations are being targeted.
""They're very easy prey - they're looking for assistance,"" says Martin Kvernbekk, of the charity. ""So if you're an adult with some food or refuge, they will come with you. They don't know any better."" 
He has heard about children going missing from a number of different sources, and reports of people smugglers wearing reflective vests and pretending to belong to organisations helping the relief effort.  
""The gangs are very advanced - it's big, well-financed networks that do this for a living. They're good at this in peace time,"" he says. ""Now it's a war, it's chaos, and they're exploiting the fact there is disorder to be able to snatch more kids and women.""
Mr Kvernbekk also points out that although most men aged 18-60 are not allowed to leave Ukraine because they have to fight, any man who has three or more children with him can pass through. But no proper vetting is taking place at the country's borders.
""There is no way to check if that man is actually the parent of the kids,"" he says. 
In a speech earlier this week, the EU Commissioner for Home Affairs, Ylva Johansson, voiced concerns. ""We also have some reports of criminals taking orphans from orphanages in Ukraine, crossing the border pretending that they are relatives to the child and then using them for trafficking purposes,"" she said.  
An absence of vetting procedures for those who volunteer to help or house refugees once they have crossed the border only compounds the problem. 
""Everybody knows it's going on, but it's difficult to say the extent because of the chaos here. The authorities are trying to track what's happened to all of the children [but] there is no paper trail,"" Mr Kvernbekk says.
The Ukrainian authorities are now establishing a system with the help of NGOs to process displaced children and setting up safe areas in the east of the country.
A member of the Aerial Recovery team fist-bumps one of the children being evacuated
On Wednesday, Aerial Recovery discussed plans to strengthen safety protocols and create safe zones in Lviv with the regional minister for child services.
""That way we don't have to take these children over borders and we can ensure that Ukraine is in control of where their children are going,"" Mr Locke says.
During that meeting the authorities expressed concern that 5,000 children on their records were unaccounted for, he says.
Nobody knows what has happened to them. ""They're either casualties of war, or they've slipped across the border, or have been taken out of the border by smugglers or by people that are doing it the wrong way,"" Mr Locke told the BBC. 
Volodymyr Lys, regional head of service of children's protection under the ministry of social policy in Lviv, told the BBC that the first 10 days of war were difficult, but it had improved. 
""It was very very chaotic. They didn't know where the kids were going. Nobody felt like they had worked out a system. Now there's enough NGOs, there's enough volunteers, everybody knows what they're doing,"" he says.
Refugees struggle to board a train at Lviv's main station
He believes more than a million children remain in conflict zones in the country. Most are now being evacuated to the east, rather than abroad. Mr Lys says currently there are 550 orphans and foster children sheltering in the Lviv region, and they are expecting that number to double. He says his team spent 10 days at Lviv train station comforting, feeding and sheltering children. ""The whole of Ukraine is absolutely horrified at what is going on,"" he says. 
When asked if children fleeing abroad could be trafficked or forced into prostitution, he admits: ""Of course there is a risk of that, especially if they are travelling without their legal guardian or come unaccompanied. 
""There's really not a way to know for sure for now how many are missing and the authorities are now trying to track what's happened to all of the children in the system,"" says Martin Kvernbekk.
Former soldier and aid worker Rob Lawrie is volunteering alongside Aerial Recovery in Ukraine. ""What we've seen is smugglers using the war in Ukraine as a shield to move in on the most vulnerable. Hopefully things are now in place to get these youngsters out of dangerous areas and make sure they can't fall into the hands of traffickers.""

304,304,Will Nato get involved if dirty bombs are used in Ukraine? And other questions,"Fri, 11 Mar 2022 16:00:22 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-60711951,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-60711951?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,BBC correspondents Lyse Doucet and Jenny Hill answer readers' questions on Ukraine,"Will Nato get involved if dirty bombs are used in Ukraine? And other questions
Concerns have been raised that President Putin may use non-conventional weapons in Ukraine, such as chemical weapons or so-called dirty bombs.
Members of the BBC audience have been sending in their questions about the impact this would have, as well as the many other aspects of the war.
Answering them are:
The BBC's chief international correspondent Lyse Doucet in Kyiv, Ukraine's capital
Europe correspondent Jenny Hill in the Russian capital, Moscow
Will the potential for a Nato engagement increase if dirty bombs or chemical weapons are used? - Gordon Mains, Glasgow 
Lyse Doucet writes:
This question must be on the minds of Nato members. But they are very careful and cautious about not being drawn into this war beyond the supply of military weapons and ammunition. 
Nato's principle of ""collective defence,"" enshrined in its Article Five, is ""an attack against one ally is considered as an attack against all allies"". It is now trying to defend ""every inch"" of Nato territory but there's a laser focus on any threats which cross the border.  
They know this threat exists - although Russia says it has no plans to invade other countries.  
What is Nato and how is it responding to the Ukraine crisis? 
Why can't we fly in humanitarian aid to besieged cities? - Steve Harvey, Northamptonshire 
Lyse Doucet writes:
Ukraine does not control its airspace. Many airports have come under attack by Russian forces, on the ground and from the air. In most parts of the country, it would be too dangerous to fly in the desperately needed supplies.  
As you've no doubt seen, a lot of aid is coming in by road across Ukraine's western borders. Western cities like Lviv, still relatively untouched by direct Russian strikes, have become a hub for humanitarian aid.  
All the countries bordering Ukraine to the west have also quickly ramped up a major emergency operation as the numbers spiral in ways not seen since World War Two.
In any war or disaster, it is always a question of resources and access. Right now, aid trucks laden with urgent supplies are being turned back by incessant Russian shelling.

How likely is it that the war in Ukraine could escalate into a full-fledged war between Russia and Nato? - Connor, Northern Ireland
Jenny Hill writes:
It's not impossible, which is why Nato has been so wary of intervention. 
Vladimir Putin has threatened any country which hinders his ""special military operation"" in Ukraine with consequences of a severity ""not experienced in your history"", which most take to mean the use of nuclear weapons. 
It's difficult to know how seriously to take Mr Putin's rhetoric but, given his recent unpredictability, many in the West are nervous about where this could all go. 
Mr Putin insists that he's only in Ukraine to protect the Russian speaking populations of Eastern Ukraine from what he deems to be the aggression of the government in Kyiv. But none of us can say for sure what his game plan really is. 
He's said he doesn't want to ""occupy"" Ukraine - but then he also he said he wouldn't invade it. More broadly, we know from what he's written and said, that he sees Nato as a huge threat to Russia and that he wants to challenge its structure, particularly in Eastern Europe. 
Nato would have to react in the event of an attack on the countries which have joined since 1997 - the countries which border Ukraine and Belarus. 
The further west that Russian forces advance, the greater the risk of a accidental - or deliberate - strike on Nato territory.
Why doesn't Ukraine attack the Russian convoy? And other questions
Could the fighting spread across Europe? And other questions
Why has the UK not expelled all the Russian diplomats and staff in London? - Julie Thompson, Preston
Jenny Hill writes:
My guess is that while there's still a hope (however fleeting) that diplomacy could end this, the UK and other Western countries will resist what would be viewed in Moscow as a provocation.
It would also likely result in the expulsion of their own embassy staff from Russia. 
After seeing all the trains fully packed, why aren't more being sent in to rescue the fleeing people? - Kate Russell, Glasgow 
Lyse Doucet writes:
The trains are running, many on time, even in this war. But in some places, including Irpin just west of Kyiv, the tracks were attacked so that station is now not in use. 
I noticed on my last trip to the wonderful 19th Century train station in Kyiv that the platforms for trains heading west were not as crowded, although the trains pulling out are certainly still full.

What's the motive behind the Russian invasion in Ukraine? - Karen Keven, Nigeria
Jenny Hill writes:
The truth is we don't really know for sure. 
Vladimir Putin claims that he's coming to the rescue of Russian speaking populations of Eastern Ukraine who are victims of ""genocide"" (of which there's no evidence) by the government in Kyiv. 
He's demanding that Ukraine officially hand over some territory in the east, including Crimea which he annexed in 2014, to Russia. He also wants Ukraine to give up on its ambition to join Nato. 
Does he have wider ambitions? Perhaps. We know he views Nato (and in particular the former Soviet countries that joined after 1997) as a threat to Russian security. 
Moscow has demanded changes to Nato structure - it wants, for example, European countries like Germany, which host US nuclear weapons, to return them to America.
There are analysts who say we also can't rule out the possibility that Mr Putin's nurturing an ambition to re-build the Soviet Union - given how its break-up appears to be a continuing and humiliating source of deep regret for him.
Is it possible for the United Nations to send troops into Ukraine and also enforce a no-fly zone? If so, why have they not made any attempt? - Joseph Akinwunmi, Lagos 
Lyse Doucet writes:
The United Nations would have to be asked and authorised to come in, usually by the UN Security Council. But at the moment this war is raging and, in some comments, Russia even denies it has invaded its neighbour.  It still calls this a ""special military operation"" to defend Russia from threats. 
Ukraine has repeatedly called for a no-fly zone. It has been repeatedly ruled out. 
Western/Nato powers know this would draw them into direct conflict with Russia. 
A no-fly zone would not just involve targeting Russian warplanes, it would also require attacks on Russian assets on the ground. 
If Russia takes control of the whole of Ukraine, what would the response be from Nato and the US? - Jeff Moono, Lusaka
Jenny Hill writes:
That's the nightmare scenario for Nato, which has bolstered troop numbers in neighbouring countries but which, for the reasons outlined above, does not want to be drawn into a war with Russia. 
There's speculation that, before that eventuality arose, Kyiv might be persuaded to do a deal with Moscow - in other words, hand over some of its territory in return for a cessation of hostilities. 
However, the problem with that scenario is, firstly, that Kyiv doesn't want to give ground, and secondly, there's also a fear that such an outcome might embolden Mr Putin. 
Nevertheless, right now most analysts assume that Russia would struggle to hold Ukraine in the long term.  
As the fighting continues and more people and soldiers will suffer horrific injuries from the bombing, will they have enough blood supplies. Should people be donating their blood? - Linda Potter 
Lyse Doucet writes:
I remember when this invasion started more than two weeks ago that a call went out for blood donations.  
Ukrainians are signing up to fight, and to donate blood - wherever and whenever they can. But, like you, you they must be asking if they have enough.  
When do all of the sanctions go into effect? - Alfred Pons, Albuquerque, US
Jenny Hill writes:
Many have already taken effect but others are pending. 
The UK has just announced sanctions on 386 members of the Duma, the lower house of the Russian parliament, who support the invasion of Ukraine. 
And the EU says it remains ready to impose more sanctions. 
Can you tell us what Belarus is doing in this conflict?  Is any of their army actually taking part? - Steve Simmons-Jacobs, Romsey  
Lyse Doucet writes:
Neighbouring Belarus became a staging ground for Russian troops and heavy weaponry in the weeks leading up the invasion (even though it was described as military exercises). It then became a launching pad for Russia to move into Ukraine, and for Russian missile strikes across the border.  
So far, the US says it sees no evidence that Belarussian forces have become directly involved.  
Belarus has also hosted talks between Russian and Ukrainian negotiating teams close to the border. 
In 2020, Russian forces helped the Belarussian leader, Alexander Lukashenko, survive an unprecedented uprising against his rule. Russian President Vladimir Putin expects him to return the favour.  
However, although it was announced before the invasion that Belarus could join the fight, Lukanshenko recently said he wouldn't. 
The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, also made a direct appeal to Belarus last month, saying ""Be Belarus, not Russia.""

306,306,Which companies are pulling out of Russia?,"Fri, 11 Mar 2022 21:44:54 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-60571133,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-60571133?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,Reputational risk and practical difficulties means the exodus of firms is growing but some remain.,"Which companies are pulling out of Russia?
Thirty years ago when communism collapsed in the Soviet Union, Western firms stepped up their presence in Russia. 
The arrival of big Western companies symbolised the start of a new era with Russians becoming eager consumers of brands ranging from fast-food chain McDonalds to Levi jeans and luxury goods. 
Now, in the wake of President Putin's invasion of Ukraine, a growing number of firms have suspended activities in Russia.
So which firms, in which sectors, are exiting and why have others held back? 
Fast food and drinks giants
McDonald's, Coca-Cola, Starbucks and Heineken are the latest companies to announce they are halting business in Russia after mounting pressure to act.
McDonald's said it was temporarily closing its roughly 850 restaurants in Russia, while Starbucks also said its 100 coffee shops would shut.
The firms were initially remained tight lipped over the conflict, but took action because shareholders ""wouldn't stand"" for the continued generation of profits from Russia, says Anna MacDonald, a fund manager at Amati Global Investors.
""It was affecting their share prices and the feeling was that it was just utterly inappropriate to continue to do so,"" she told the BBC.
Pepsi, which has a much larger presence in Russia than rival Coca-Cola, said it was halting the production and sale of Pepsi and other global brands in Russia, but the company, which employs 20,000 people there, said it would continue to offer other products.
Food companies Nestle, Mondelez, Procter & Gamble and Unilever have halted investment in Russia, but said they would continue providing essentials.
British American Tobacco has announced it plans to sell its business in Russia due to it being ""no longer sustainable in the current environment"".
Retail
The world's biggest cosmetics firm L'Oreal and rival Estee Lauder are both closing shops , external and ceasing online sales. Estee Lauder, whose brands include Michael Kors, DKNY, Clinique and Bobbi Brown, has had a presence in the country for about 30 years and Russia was where it had some of its strongest sales.
In fact, Russia was the fifth largest European retail market globally last year, valued at £337.2bn. So some brands may not want to burn their bridges, if there's a chance of returning at a later date.
That is why many firms, including other luxury retailers like Burberry and Chanel, simply say they are ""suspending"" sales and temporarily shutting stores rather than withdrawing altogether, says Chris Weafer, chief executive of consulting firm Macro-advisory Limited. 
With sanctions limiting forms of payment and huge uncertainty over future prices and consumer appetite, the business climate is ""extremely challenging"" he adds, making the decision to hit pause easier. 
The world's biggest fashion retailers H&M and Zara-owner Inditex, which has 502 stores in the country, for example have already suspended sales in Russia, citing ""tragic developments"" in Ukraine. Other brands like Nike have simply said they can't currently guarantee delivery of goods to customers in Russia.
More brands are likely to follow suit, according to Maureen Hinton of retail consultancy GlobalData. Boohoo, Swedish furniture giant Ikea and Japanese clothing retailer Uniqlo which initially kept its 49 Russian stores open, saying clothes were a ""necessity of life"", are some of the other names to have now cut ties. 
Even Levi's, the jeans brand that became a symbol of post-Soviet business in Russia, has closed its shops. The all-American jeans firm said about, external 4% of its total net sales came from Eastern Europe and Russia last year, but ""any business considerations are clearly secondary to the human suffering experienced by so many"".
Technology
Samsung, the leading supplier of smartphones in Russia, has said it will suspend shipments to the country but has not said whether its shops will close.
Japan's Sony and Nintendo suspended deliveries of gaming consoles, and Sony suspended the launch of racing game ""Gran Turismo 7"".
Apple has also halted all of its product sales in Russia, and limited other services such as Apple Pay and Apple Maps. Its shops have closed too.
All shops under the Re:store in Moscow have been shut as Apple halts all product sales in Russia
For a firm like Apple selling imported items, that's a relatively straightforward decision to take, suggests Macro-advisory's Chris Weafer. 
""Companies do not want to be associated with the Russian regime and what's happening in Ukraine,"" he says. Their Russian business may be profitable, but ""the rest of the world is more important"" when it comes to reputational risk.
Some tech companies, flooded by misinformation, are also restricting Kremlin-linked media outlets posting on their platforms. Facebook was blocked in Russia after it said it had refused to stop fact-checking and labelling content from state-owned news organisations. 
Meanwhile, TikTok has blocked all non-Russian content in Russia and suspended live streaming, although it is allowing historical content uploaded by domestic accounts to stay online, including videos by state-backed media services.
Consultancy firms
Large consultancy and law firms were some of the first to set up a presence in Russia after the collapse of the Soviet Union but they mostly operate out of the spotlight. 
All of the Big Four accounting groups - Deloitte, KPMG, EY and PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) - have said they will no longer have a member firm in Russia because of the invasion. Top-tier law firm Freshfields says it will no longer work with any clients linked to the Russian state either.
Others say they are reviewing their client base and Russian links. 
What sanctions are being imposed on Russia?
How badly will Russia be hit by new sanctions?
A senior executive for consultancy firm McKinsey, for example, wrote online that the company would ""no longer serve"" any government or state-owned entities in Russia. According to McKinsey's website, it serves 21 of the 30 biggest Russian companies.
Oil and gas
When the conflict in Ukraine broke out, energy firms came under immediate pressure. And that is set to intensify now the UK, US and UK have announced bans or curbs on Russian oil and gas.
BP owns a large stake in Russian energy giant Rosneft, but within days of the war starting it had announced the operation would be hived off. 
That was closely followed by pledges from Shell, ExxonMobil and Equinor to cut their Russian investments following pressure from shareholders, as well as from governments and the public.

Firms want to be seen to be doing the ""right thing"", says Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell.
Meanwhile, Total Energies, another big player in Russia, has said it won't fund new projects in the country, but unlike its peers does not plan to sell existing investments.
It is still far from clear what will happen to those investments - whether they can eventually be sold, recouping some of their value, or if they will simply be written off at great cost.
Entertainment
Film fans in Russia wanting to go and see Warner Bros' new blockbuster The Batman won't be able to after the company suspended new film releases in the country.
The US movie-maker was joined by Disney and Sony, with premieres of animation Turning Red and Marvel adaptation Morbius also being withdrawn. Disney has also paused its TV channels.
Netflix, a fairly new entrant in Russia, has suspended its service in the country and put all ""future projects"" on pause.
Pixar's new animated film Turning Red won't be released in Russia
All companies said their decisions were based on the ""humanitarian crisis"" in Ukraine, rather than as a result of sanctions that have been imposed.
All three of the world's major record labels - Sony, Warner and Universal - have closed their offices in Russia, and Spotify has announced it is cancelling its subscription service, although the free, ad-funded version will still work.
Finance
Payment giants Visa, Mastercard, American Express and PayPal are pulling out of the Russian market in protest.
Russian banks have, however, already downplayed the impact of the announcements on their clients. 
Sberbank, for example, said that Visa and Mastercard-branded cards would continue to work on Russian territory because all payments in Russia are made through a national system.  
However, domestically issued cards won't work abroad, and foreign-issued ones won't work inside the country.
US investment bank Goldman Sachs was the first Wall Street bank to say it was winding down its Russian business. The bank, soon followed by JPMorgan, said it was doing so in compliance with regulatory and licensing requirements. 
German lender Deutsche Bank, which had faced criticism for defending plans not to withdraw, has also said it was taking steps to exit, pledging ""there won't be any new business in Russia"".
Cars
Jaguar Land Rover, General Motors, Aston Martin and Rolls-Royce are among the car-makers that have halted deliveries of vehicles to Russia due to the conflict, while construction equipment manufacturer JCB has paused all operations.
Jaguar Land Rover said sales were paused due to ""trading challenges""
Cars are the biggest UK export to Russia, but still only 1% of UK cars went to Russia last year. 
So any decision to stop exporting won't be particularly costly, and will have been made easier by nagging concerns over whether or not payments will arrive, says investment analyst Russ Mould.
Transporting cars to Russia could prove difficult anyway, with the world's two largest cargo shipping companies, MSC and Maersk, suspending routes to and from Russia, except for food, medical and humanitarian supply deliveries.
Which firms remain?
While the flood of announcements from companies stepping back goes on, there are calls for more to join them.
Attention has turned to big food firms like Burger King who have condemned Russia's actions and have pledged support for Ukraine, but are yet to pull out.
Some firms will also find it much harder to extricate themselves, even if pressure mounts in the coming days and weeks.
In retaliation against sanctions introduced by Western countries, Moscow has banned the sale of Russian assets. So firms that, in recent years, have been encouraged to establish a presence in Russia are ""locked in"" with local businesses, staff and supply chains.
Marks & Spencer, for example, has 48 shops in Russia but they are operated by a Turkish franchise company called FiBA. M&S has said it is suspending shipments of its goods to FiBA's Russian business, but the shops in the country remain open.
Restaurant Brands International, which owns Burger King, told the BBC its Russian outlets were operated by franchisees  with which it had ""long-standing legal agreements"" that were not easy to change.
Yum Brands, which owns KFC and Pizza Hut, said it was suspending operations in the Russian KFC restaurants it owns, and finalising an agreement with its main franchisee to temporarily halt Pizza Hut operations.
Mr Weafer predicts it is likely that some large consumer brands may express concerns over the military conflict, but try to ""ride it out"".

BBC Sport answers some of the key questions.,"Roman Abramovich: What do Russian owner's sanctions mean for Chelsea?
Chelsea's next game at Stamford Bridge is on Sunday when Newcastle are the visitors in the Premier League
The future of European champions Chelsea is uncertain after sanctions were placed on Russian owner Roman Abramovich on Thursday.
The billionaire has been in charge since 2003 but had his attempts to sell the club halted by the UK government, which has frozen his assets.
What does it mean for Chelsea's fans, players and staff? BBC Sport explains how the situation will affect those associated with the club.
What exactly happened on Thursday?

Nadine Dorries says her focus is to protect Chelsea FC, its fans and the ""national game""
Abramovich was sanctioned by the UK government as part of its response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
The government believes the billionaire has had a ""close relationship for decades"" with Russia's president Vladimir Putin, links Abramovich has always denied.
Watch: The Football News Show - Chelsea special
The Sports Desk: Life after Abramovich - what's next for Chelsea and English football?
Like the rest of his assets, Chelsea would have been frozen but a special licence granted by the government allows the Stamford Bridge club to keep operating.
Can Chelsea continue to play games?
Yes. 
The special licence issued by the government allows the men's and women's teams to fulfil their fixtures for the rest of this season as normal.
Chelsea's men won away at Norwich in the Premier League on Thursday while Chelsea's women were victorious at West Ham in the Women's Super League at the same time.
What does it mean for match-going fans?
Chelsea's club shop has closed after club owner Roman Abramovich was sanctioned by the UK government
Season-ticket holders will still be able to attend games at Stamford Bridge as normal, while match tickets sold before 10 March will be honoured.
But beyond that, supporters cannot buy any new tickets to watch Chelsea. 
Tickets were due to go on sale for the FA Cup quarter-final tie at Middlesbrough on 19 March but a post on the club's official website, external on Thursday confirmed that would no longer happen as planned.
The club is also unable to sell any merchandise, with the club shop at Stamford Bridge closing on Thursday morning.
Can Chelsea sell season tickets for next year? 
BBC senior sports news reporter Laura Scott: 
All the licence says is that anyone who purchased season tickets before 10 March, and makes payments in regular instalments, can ""continue to make those payments"". 
No mention has been made about future seasons.
Can Chelsea keep paying staff wages in the short and mid-terms?
The government's special licence allows Chelsea to pay the wages of all employees, including players and coaching staff.
The licence is in place until 31 May, so covers the Blues for the rest of the season and the Treasury has the right to vary, revoke or suspend it at any time.
Do these sanctions mean they cannot transfer players in or out?
Antonio Rudiger's future at Chelsea is uncertain with his contract expiring in the summer
While the sanctions are in place, Chelsea are effectively under a transfer ban and are unable to buy or sell players.
They are also unable to negotiate new contracts for the players they currently own, so leaves an uncertain future for those whose current deals expire in the summer.
That applies to Antonio Rudiger, Cesar Azpilicueta, and Andreas Christensen, although the latter two have been linked with a move to Barcelona. 
Rudiger was believed to be close to a new deal but current developments leave the defender in a limbo situation.
What about the future of Chelsea men and women head coaches?
BBC Sport's Simon Stone:
It's the same situation for both Thomas Tuchel and Emma Hayes - nobody has any idea how this will affect them yet. 
They have got contracts, no-one is saying they won't get paid. However, this is a time of great change. Does it make the club more vulnerable to an approach for either manager from a rival team? Things are likely to change significantly at the club. 
Tuchel said the future was uncertain, though he was happy to remain as manager when giving his reaction to Thursday's developments after Chelsea's game at Norwich later on the same day.
Thomas Tuchel and Emma Hayes coach the men's and women's teams respectively
BBC Sport's Emma Sanders: 
Hayes, who has been at the club for a decade, signed a long-term contract in July and had her eye on chasing a first Champions League title with Chelsea. 
She is extremely well supported within the club and has earned the respect from those high up, having won 10 major trophies during her time in charge.
Hayes was also among the exclusive list of trustees to whom Abramovich attempted to give 'stewardship' of Chelsea at the end of last month. Her commitment to the club has never been questioned so fans will no doubt be monitoring the situation cautiously.

The Football News Show: What do sanctions mean for the sale of Chelsea?
Can Chelsea still be sold?
BBC Sport's Alistair Magowan: 
Chelsea were put up for sale on 2 March and there are understood to be plenty of interested parties, despite Abramovich being sanctioned.
The UK government is open to considering a further addition to the special licence to allow a sale to proceed.
Those working on the deal on behalf of Abramovich were always told that proceeds from the sale would go to a fund for victims of the war in Ukraine.
This was made clear when Abramovich put the club up for sale last week. It is understood that the £1.5bn loan from Abramovich will not be deducted from the price.
Abramovich had instructed American investment firm Raine Group to seek £3bn for the club, but finance experts believe that an already inflated price could drop further given the current uncertainty around Chelsea.
Raine Group has temporarily halted the sale process while it seeks answers from the government.
How quickly the club can be sold once a buyer has been found depends on the government receiving assurances that the proceeds would not go to Abramovich, but securing those assurances could take time.
What about Chelsea's participation in European competition? 
Chelsea's men's side won the Champions League last season while the women's team were runners-up
BBC senior sports news reporter Laura Scott: 
All we've had from Uefa at this stage is that it is ""seeking further clarification on the matter"" before it comments further. 
What Uefa is presumably trying to establish is what happens if Chelsea make it through to the quarter-finals of the Champions League, and can't sell any tickets.  
If Chelsea get to the FA Cup semi-finals, will their section of the ground be empty?
Chelsea's men's side are away to Championship side Middlesbrough in the quarter-finals on 19 March (17:15 GMT), which will be shown live on BBC One. 
If they win that then they will play at Wembley in the semi-finals on the weekend 16-17 April.
It is unclear at this stage how the the restrictions would impact FA Cup ticket sales if they progressed to Wembley.
Can Chelsea afford away travel, given the government budget?
BBC senior sports news reporter Laura Scott: 
The government has set a limit of £20,000 per team per match for travel to and from matches. 
BBC Sport understands the club considers the £20,000 cap to be too low to allow it to operate normally, and this is a pressing matter given next week the men's team travel to Lille in the Champions League.
How much are Chelsea's sponsors worth and how have they reacted?
Within hours of the announcement that Abramovich had been sanctioned by the UK government, Chelsea' main shirt sponsors suspended their £40m-a-year deal with the club.
Mobile network provider Three had been Chelsea's official partner since 2020.
It is unclear whether any of Chelsea's other sponsorship deals are at risk at this stage.
In 2016, the London club signed a new kit deal with US sportswear giants Nike. At the time it was reported to be worth £60m a season for the next 15 years, but the club did not confirm any cash figures.
In May 2021, Chelsea named global hotel search platform Trivago as the club's official training wear partner in a multi-year partnership.
Chelsea also have a number of other official partners.
Could Chelsea go into administration?
If Chelsea are unable to pay their bills they could go into administration and face a nine-point deduction.
Financial journalist Kieran Maguire: 
In the short term, it's to a large extent business as usual. Chelsea will be able to pay wages due at the end of March and will have other overheads.
Chelsea's wage bill is round about £28m a month. We don't know how much cash they have in the bank. The most recent accounts we have are from June 2021 when there was £16m in the bank. Abramovich has been injecting money into Chelsea on a regular basis over recent years and presumably that won't be able to continue.
The concern might be what happens if Chelsea's cash reserves are insufficient to pay their wage bill - but presumably the government and Premier League, who have been working on this, will have been looking at it to try to minimise disruption on a club level.

The coming battle for Ukraine's capital and the ongoing fallout dominates the headlines.
The headline on the front page of The Times reads: ""Kyiv ready to face the onslaught, external"". A woman in army fatigues - a gun held across her body - is shown standing in a trench, dug by Ukrainian fighters. The paper says the city now awaits ""the seemingly inevitable arrival of Russian tanks"".
The i's front page is taken up by a picture of two men standing on a train station platform in Kyiv with pained expressions on their faces. The paper says the Russian military are ""systematically targeting people, external"" who try to escape the siege and that the streets on the city's outskirts are ""littered with corpses"".
President Putin could be developing a ""plot to blackmail the world, external"", according to the Daily Express. The paper says Ukrainian spy chiefs suspect the Russian leader of planning a ""false flag"" attack on the Chernobyl nuclear site which he will then try to blame on Ukraine. It says the attack would be intended to ""hold the world to ransom"" and ""stop the West halting his invasion"". 
People set up a barrier made out of sandbags in downtown Kyiv
A call for a ""massive boost"" in defence spending, external from former Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt leads the Daily Telegraph. Writing in the paper, Hunt declares: ""Peace comes from strength, not luck"". But the paper also says it understands Chancellor Rishi Sunak is holding firm against calls for a rise in the defence budget.
The Guardian reports that French President Emmanuel Macron has savaged the UK, external government's response to the Ukrainian refugee crisis. Speaking at the end of a EU summit in Versailles, Mr Macron reportedly said the UK had brought additional misery to those fleeing the conflict by insisting visa applications to the UK are made in Paris and Brussels. 
The front page of the Daily Mirror features the words ""Hope amid horror"" above a photo of a young Ukrainian woman, external who has safely given birth to a baby girl. The paper says Marianna Podgurskaya - who still has visible cuts and bruises on her face - had to flee from a bomb blast on her maternity ward in Mariupol two days ago.

There are ""fresh fears"" for the Queen's health, external, says the Daily Mail. It comes after an announcement that the 95-year-old, who recently had Covid, will not be attending Monday's Commonwealth Day service at Westminster Abbey. The paper says the service has always been ""so important"" the Queen and that she is understood to be ""extremely regretful"" about missing it.
The Sun leads with criticism of Prince Harry's decision, external not to travel from California for his grandfather's memorial service at the end of this month. The prince has reportedly said he would feel ""unsafe"" making the journey after losing his personal security, but the paper calls it an ""astonishing snub"" to his family.
The sports sections continue to be dominated by Chelsea and the fallout from the sanctions imposed on the football club's Russian owner, Roman Abramovich. The Telegraph says that Chelsea stars are exploring potential escape routes, external after company credit cards were frozen, while the Mirror reports that Chelsea's manager, Thomas Tuchel, has talked of players being ""frightened"", external about the future.
The i says that club officials have begged the government to ease financial curbs, external, while The Guardian says it's the end of the ""Abramovich era"", external but suggests that a fast sale of the club can ""limit Chelsea's woes"".

After receiving an anonymous tip-off on Facebook, Georgie discovered that intimate photos of her were being shared online. 
She remembered who had taken the photos - and later an ex-partner confessed to sharing the images. But Georgie then found out that the wording of the current legislation aimed at tackling the abuse meant that his confession may have been the thing that protected him. 
Georgie has been campaigning with groups like the End Violence Against Women Coalition and #NotYourPorn to see the legislation around intimate image abuse changed. 
She spoke to the BBC ahead of the government's long-awaited Online Safety bill, due to be published this week, which the government have said will address a vast list of online harms, including intimate image abuse.

The National Newspaper Building holds the equivalent of 60 million issues and grows by 1,200 issues a week
The British Library's main storehouse is a marvel. An unrivalled collection of human knowledge with more than 300 miles of shelves tended by robot librarians. But as its stock of millions and millions of titles continues to swell, it desperately needs somewhere to put them. The BBC took a rare tour inside its cavernous vaults, and found out about plans to ensure the nation's printed works are preserved.
""We have finite space, but infinite amounts of material coming in.""
Alasdair Bruce pithily summarises the big - and constantly growing - problem he and other bosses at the British Library face at its massive northern base in West Yorkshire. 
From the outside, this repository which is intended to hold every book and publication published in the UK could not look less like a library. 
Situated in Boston Spa, next to the football pitches of Leeds United's training ground and the barbed wire fences of a category C prison, the 44-acre facility is an architectural pick-and-mix of brutalist concrete, vast warehouses and even ex-World War Two munitions workshops. 
Inside, though, three-quarters of the British Library's entire 170 million-strong collection can be found, including medical journals used by health workers researching Covid-19 treatments, electoral registers for families delving into their genealogy and decades-old newspapers used by police researching cold cases.
And, of course, books. 
If something has come from a recognised UK publisher, it can either be found at the library's much more famous premises in central London, or here at its massive but somewhat non-descript Yorkshire base.
Each evening at the Boston Spa site, a lorry is loaded with books, newspapers and other tomes requested by members of the public at the library in London, with the titles arriving at its 11 reading rooms in St Pancras just 48 hours after order. 
But, becoming home to seven million physical items in just the last 10 years, and requiring five miles of new shelving every year, the library's 550 staff at Boston Spa are currently fighting a losing battle against the constant wave of new publications - and the fear is that battle could be lost in a very short time. 
Programme manager Mr Bruce says the library's site near Leeds, will be full to the brim in as little as two years.
A new solution is needed very soon.
A copy of The Globe newspaper from 1919, held at Boston Spa, warns about Russia and a fresh bout of Spanish Flu
That is why Mr Bruce is now part of the team leading plans for the site's biggest redevelopment in its 60-year history. While it is a battle against the clock, it is one he believes can be won.
""We have between two and three years before we are full in all our stores,"" he says.
""That is enough time for us to create a new building to cover our storage needs until mid-century.""
The brimming bookshelves at Boston Spa are a direct result of what is known as the Legal Deposit Act.
That act means a copy of every work which has been published in the UK as far back as 1662 is placed in the British Library - with that rule expanded to include digital publications such as websites and blogs from 2013 onwards.  
The act is in place to ensure the nation's published output is collected systematically and preserved for future generations to provide inspiration for future works.
But the downside to that laudable aim is the sheer physical space required to house the nation's source of knowledge and inspiration. 
The Additional Storage Building at Boston Spa has space to house 11 million items, with up to 2,000 added each week
The current solution at Boston Spa is two cavernous storage buildings, each maintaining a constant temperature and humidity, with an oxygen level 7% lower than in the air outside their sealed doors. 
""If you tried to strike a match in here, nothing would happen due to the lack of oxygen,"" Mr Bruce says.
Standing on a metal gantry inside what is known as the Additional Storage Building, he is interrupted by the whizzing of a giant robotic crane - one of seven which covers the length and height of the 272ft (83m) by 79ft (24m) warehouse, pulling out barcoded crates containing requested titles. 
The nearby National Newspaper Building is just as impressive, with room for 60 million issues of local, regional and national UK newspapers from the last three centuries.
The British Library's site at Boston Spa was selected due to its central location and the ease of access
But with additions constantly being made to the library's shelves, a planned new storage building at the Boston Spa site, providing an extra 137 miles of shelf space, looks set to be coming at the perfect moment.
Mr Bruce says: ""It's literally going to be just in time, but it is under control so I'm happy with that.""
Phil Spence, the British Library's chief operating officer, says the new building would certainly be a much better solution than one he proposed 15 years ago. 
""When I joined, I said, 'why don't we throw out some stuff which has less value?' I was very quickly shot down and told everything has value,"" he says.
""Something that might seem obscure to me, or might not be the next cancer treatment, still has value. 
""It could be people interested in tortoises or whatever. It doesn't always have to create economic value, it can create fun, inspiration and joy.""
British Library staff Phil Spence, Daniela Shedden and Alasdair Bruce are part of the team helping to redevelop the Boston Spa facility
The new storage building is part of a £95m redevelopment of the entire site, which will also introduce renewable energy sources in a bid to become carbon neutral and the welcome refurbishment of existing buildings used by staff.
Speaking in the library canteen, shortly before heading off to a cyber security training exercise which imagines hackers infiltrating the digital archives, Mr Spence says: ""We're sitting in a 1940s bomb workshop. They're not particularly comfortable and our staff deserve more.
""We're the biggest employer in the culture sector outside of London, but they're currently working in the worst conditions.""

2009: The Additional Storage Building opens at the site, with the ability to hold 11 million books
2015: The National Newspaper Building opens, following the closure of the Newspaper Library at Colindale in London
With the new storage space, the British Library also hopes to respond to criticisms of its lack of accessibility in the north of England, with even some residents in West Yorkshire oblivious to the treasure trove on their doorstep. 
The library has promised that the renovation work will rectify this, with a viewing gallery planned for the new storage unit, along with school visits, tours, a new reading room and a restaurant for visitors.  
The renovation plans will include a public viewing area in the new storage unit to watch the robot librarians in action
A future ambition is to open a new British Library site at Leeds' landmark Temple Works building, turning the derelict mill into its public face in the North, with the scheme currently at the feasibility study stage.
While proudly admiring a huge model of the Boston Spa project, due for completion in 2026, Daniela Shedden, business change manager, says: ""The vast majority of people don't even know we're here in Yorkshire.
""Yet, we've got so much to show here and we have bags of knowledge that you just don't get anywhere else.
""We want it to become an open space for everyone to come and visit.""

This was the first time the free-from category produced an overall winning pie, which was made from vegetarian jackfruit ""steak"", gluten-free craft ale and black pepper.
Mr O'Callaghan added: ""The pastry was crunchy, complemented by the moist filling which had 'bite' and the balance of flavours in the pie was just right.
""Up to now gluten free pies were always compared unfavourably with other pies. 
""With this pie, gluten free pies are now equal to any other pie. Being vegetarian and gluten free, Pieminister's Mooless Pie is an 'everybody's pie' be they vegetarian or meat eater, gluten tolerant or intolerant.
""Serve this at a meal and almost everyone's a winner! Congratulations Pieminister!""
The awards occupied people's attention over three days from Wednesday to Friday
There were 23 different classes of hot and cold savoury and dessert pies and pasties for the judges to consider in the contest, which returned to its traditional March timing after the pandemic saw 2021's event moved to September.
Entries included a kangaroo, ale and Tasmanian pepperberry pie, a spiced miso beef short ribs and sour cherries pie, a Christmas dinner pie and a rhubarb and custard pie.
Along with a trophy and the coveted title of Supreme Champion of 2022, Pieminister has won an all-expenses-paid trip to the Japanese Trade Fair.
One entry included a kangaroo pie
In 2019, a curried sweet potato and butternut squash vegan pie was the overall winner and made national headlines. 
While last year's champion was a meat and potato pie from Nottinghamshire-based Bowring Butchers.

315,315,Mystery drone from Ukraine war crashes in Croatia,"Fri, 11 Mar 2022 14:22:00 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-60709952,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-60709952?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,Experts believe a drone that crashed in Zagreb was a Soviet-era type used by the Ukrainian military.,"Mystery drone from Ukraine war crashes in Croatia
The debris suggests it was a Soviet-era drone used by the Ukrainian military
People in Croatia's capital Zagreb were rudely awakened to Russia's war in Ukraine when a military drone crashed in the city late last night.
There was an explosion in the southwestern Jarun district shortly after 23:00 (22:00 GMT). Residents found a crater and wreckage scattered close to student accommodation.
Zagreb's mayor Tomislav Tomasevic said ""it's amazing that no-one was injured"".
Croatia's president said there was no sign the country had been targeted.
Witness reports suggested the only person hurt was a man who fell off his bicycle as the drone hit the ground.  
Markings on the debris included Cyrillic lettering and a five-pointed star. Local experts said these suggested that the drone was a Soviet-era TU-141 reconnaissance aircraft. 
Despite the drone's vintage, it has been deployed by the Ukrainian military both in 2014 and during the current conflict.
Croatian media have been speculating about its origin. Although Ukraine's embassy in Zagreb declined to comment, an adviser to Ukraine's defence ministry was adamant the drone was not Ukrainian and did not have Ukrainian markings.
The mayor said the incident was unprecedented for Zagreb, a city some 570km (355 miles) from the Ukrainian border. 
Croatia's government confirmed that the drone had passed over Hungary, which borders both Ukraine and Croatia, before crashing in Zagreb.
President Zoran Milanovic said it was a serious incident: ""We need to review certain procedural issues and determine how it is possible that this size of plane was not shot down on the way from Ukraine to Zagreb.""
He was concerned that Croatia had received no warning of the incoming drone, even though it had spent the best part of an hour flying across Hungary - a fellow member of Nato. He was alarmed that ""an unsophisticated aircraft"" had apparently evaded detection.
Croatia's Index news website suggested the drone may have been meant to fly to a location in Ukraine called Yarun, rather than the similar sounding district of Jarun in Zagreb. 
There is now concern that Croatia would not be ready if the worst happened and the conflict spread. Critics point out that no air raid sirens sounded in Zagreb and that many Croatian shelters have fallen into disrepair. 
Many people still have strong memories of conflict on home soil in the 1990s. This drone incident serves as an unwelcome reminder of the Balkans Wars and will certainly jolt Croatia's authorities out of any sense of complacency.

Simon Mayo and Mark Kermode's final programme together on 5 Live will air on Friday 1 April
Film critic Mark Kermode and radio presenter Simon Mayo are to leave their long-running Friday film review programme on BBC Radio 5 Live.
The pair have presented the show on the network for 21 years, but their last programme will air on Friday, 1 April.
It has not yet been announced who will replace them, nor whether the duo plan to take the format to another station.
But Mayo, who also presents a show on Greatest Hits Radio, indicated that the pair would return elsewhere.
""After 21 years (and as many drummers), the Flagship Film Show @Wittertainment will make its final 5 Live voyage on April 1st,"" he tweeted., external ""But like [Spinal] Tap, we'll be back… Stay tuned.""
In an official statement, the pair made clear that the decision to leave was their own.

Speaking on Friday's programme, Mayo added: ""We are way too expensive, and there are better things for the BBC to be spending their money on.""
Kermode will continue to present Screenshot alongside Ellen E Jones on BBC Radio 4 and his regular film review on the BBC News Channel.
The BBC said 5 Live Drive would move an hour earlier, to 4pm, following Kermode and Mayo's departure, with announcements on other schedule changes to follow in due course.
In recent weeks, Kermode and Mayo's show has been slightly shorter, while the Drive programme has started earlier, to allow for coverage of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
Over the years, the film review show has curated a roster of guest hosts who deliver their verdicts on the week's new releases when Kermode and Mayo are on holiday. 
Recent stand-ins include The Telegraph's Robbie Collin, Radio 1's Ali Plumb, writer and critic Anna Bogutskaya, broadcaster Edith Bowman and actor Rufus Jones.
The BBC has lost several popular podcast hosts recently, including Peter Crouch (pictured) and Americast's Emily Maitlis and Jon Sopel
Mayo also used to present a show on BBC Radio 2, but exited the station in 2018 after a revamped drivetime show he co-hosted with Jo Whiley proved unpopular with listeners. 
He continued to co-host the weekly 5 Live show with Kermode after leaving Radio 2, but also took a new role with media giant Bauer, presenting shows on its classical station Scala Radio and the popular music station Greatest Hits Radio.
Fans and friends of the show were quick to react on Twitter, with Radio 1 critic Plumb writing:, external ""I cannot conceive of the show ending, so relieved it'll be back in some form!""
The Jewish Chronicle's film critic Linda Marrin wrote:, external ""I've said it before, and I'll say it again. Five years of Film Studies didn't teach me as much about film criticism as Mark did.""
""I'm only doing what I do now because of how profoundly @KermodeMovie, @simonmayo & @wittertainment inspired me as a kid getting into cinema,"" added Empire Magazine's Jordan King, external. ""I can only presume this isn't the end, but if it is then what a legacy to have forged on the airwaves.""
""So sad to say goodby to an absolute colossus, if not the colossus of British radio,"" said John Robins, external, whose 5 Live show immediately precedes Kermode and Mayo. ""Thank you for two decades of sanity and companionship. I sincerely hope it will be alright in the end.""
The Film Review show, also known as Wittertainment, developed a loyal following over two decades. In addition to its popularity on 5 Live, the show also attracts a healthy audience to its podcast, which features additional material.
BBC Radio 5 Live's controller, Heidi Dawson, said: ""Mark and Simon's unique partnership has been an important part of BBC Radio 5 Live for 21 years. Their decision to end the programme is a sad moment; they will be much missed by our listeners and everyone at the station.""  
Kermode and Mayo's departure follows the exits of several high-profile BBC figures, many of whom are taking their programmes to the commercial sector.
Emily Maitlis and Jon Sopel, presenters of Americast, have joined Global for a new show, while The Peter Crouch Podcast is moving from the BBC to podcast company Acast.

12 February 2020: Six new charges
Special prosecutor Dan Webb, who was assigned to investigate how the case was handled, says in a statement he is going to further prosecute Smollett.
The actor is charged with six counts of lying to police. 
29 November 2021: Trial begins
Smollett was embraced by supporters as he entered court at the start of his trial on 29 November 2021
On the opening day of his trial, authorities allege that Smollett paid the Osundairo brothers to carry out the attack to promote his career because he was ""dissatisfied with his salary"" on Empire.
Special prosecutor Dan Webb argues the actor had ""developed a secret plan that would make it appear there was actually a hate crime that actually occurred against him by supporters of Donald Trump"".
During the trial Smollett says the cheque was for a meal and workout plan from Abel, who he says he was involved in a sexual relationship with before the alleged attack.
Smollett repeatedly denies in court that he had been involved in a ""hoax"", and says he did not call the police because ""as a black man in America, I don't trust the police, I'm sorry"".
9 December 2021: Smollett found guilty
The jury of six men and six women reaches its decision one day after deliberations begin.
It finds Smollett guilty of five of the six counts of disorderly conduct, meaning that the last one had not been proven in court.
Each count carries a penalty of up to three years in prison. Given Smollett's lack of previous convictions, experts have said a lighter sentence or probation is likely. 
A sentencing date has yet to be scheduled.
11 March 2022: Sentencing and jail time 
Three years after the hoax attack and first police report, Jussie Smollett was sentenced to 150 days jail time and ordered to pay a fine of $145,000 (£110,000).
His sentence also includes 30 months of probation.
His 150 day sentence began immediately after his court appearance
Throughout the trial, the actor always claimed he had been the victim of a crime.
""There is nothing that I can do here today that can come close to the damage you've already done to your own life,"" Judge James Linn told Smollett during the sentencing.
""You've turned your life upside down by your conduct and shenanigans.""

Authorities in Honduras have burnt more than eight tonnes of cocaine that has been seized in various operations in the country since 2020.
Xiomara Castro, from the left-wing Libre Party, was sworn in as the president of Honduras in early 2022. She has promised to tackle the powerful drug trafficking gangs in the country.
Her predecessor, former president Juan Orlando Hernandez, is in prison for alleged ties to drug traffickers.
A former chief of the Honduran National Police is also facing drug trafficking charges in the US. He is accused of helping ship drugs on behalf of the former Honduran president.

Martin Compston speaks to BBC The Edit's David Farrell about Sweet Sixteen
He is best known for playing Detective Inspector Steve Arnott in Line of Duty but Scottish actor Martin Compston vividly remembers how he got his big break into acting as a schoolboy.
He was pulled up by a teacher in the corridor of St Columba's High School in Gourock and told that a film crew were looking for kids to star in a film. 
""I remember Mr Harkins saying ""what they're describing, I think you're exactly it. I think you should go and meet them',"" he told BBC Scotland. ""Looking back, that probably means a wee guy that had far too much to say for himself.""
Martin Compston (left) made his acting debut in Sweet Sixteen 20 years ago
Compston auditioned and landed the lead role in Ken Loach's gritty drama Sweet Sixteen which is celebrating its 20th anniversary this year.

The film tells the story of Liam, a teenage boy from a troubled background who dreams of starting afresh with his mother as soon as she has completed her prison term.
Liam's attempts to raise money for the two of them are set against the backdrop of the Inverclyde towns of Greenock - where Compston is from - Port Glasgow and the coast at Gourock.
It went on to win the Best Screenplay Award at the 2002 Cannes Film Festival.

""In some ways it feels like a lifetime ago but in other ways I have such vivid memories of it,"" Compston, 37, said. ""I have recently seen videos of my time in Cannes - that voice,  it's like nails on a chalk board, even going through me. I'm like 'what you on about kid?' but I'm very proud of it.
""It was a great time in my life and I'll be forever grateful to Ken Loach, Paul Laverty (screenplay writer) and Rebecca O'Brien (producer) for taking a chance on me and setting me on a path to, so far, a very lovely career.""
To celebrate the 20th anniversary, Sweet Sixteen is being shown at Glasgow Film festival on Sunday with Compston taking part in a Q&A afterwards. It has already sold out.
'Greenock will always be home'
The actor, who lives between Scotland and Las Vegas with his wife and toddler son, is proud of his Scottish roots and speaks with great affection for his home town of Greenock.
Speaking from his Vegas home, he said: ""I do love it here but Greenock is, and always will be, home. It's where all my family and friends are. We're very lucky to have two homes - it's fantastic to have this [Las Vegas home] as a sort of getaway for me. 
""I am so grateful for how kind people are to me at home, especially in Inverclyde. You always feel like people are rooting for you in Scotland but it's nice to get here and just have the anonymity.
Martin Compston speaks of his hometown of Greenock with great affection
""It's quiet - I don't need to plan my trips to Tesco or whatever and get a disguise on. I can take the wee fella to the park and I can be silly with him, not having to worry about cameras and stuff. But at the same time I get home next week and I'll be home for the rest of the year practically and I can't wait.
""I'm under no illusions how lucky we are to have this sort of dual life. We are very lucky that where we live in Greenock we're in a great spot and my son loves it over there. He's a lucky, lucky boy.""
On being a dad, Compston said: ""I'm probably a bit calmer because you have to be. I think most people would have described me as sociable, I was fond of a night out. I still am but you have to pick and choose your battles these days. When my wife is away working I've got to be parent number one which is great.""
After seeing Compston with a London accent in Line of Duty, many fans assume he is English and are surprised when they hear him speak with a Scottish accent as he does in his latest drama, Our House.
Martin Compston (right) is close friends with his Line of Duty co-stars Vicky McClure and Adrian Dunbar
""I've been doing it [acting] 20 years now so I hope people are starting to get the message,"" he said.
""People ask me all the time why they put me in an English accent [for Line of Duty] but it was never a discussion, I'm an actor, it's my job and the character was from London. 
""It's hard, it's another element. You go in and have to do incredibly dense dialogue for 20 pages with amazing actors - throw an accent in there it can be tough. 
""But one of the good things about being able to keep my own accent is I feel with the Scots we can turn on a bit of charm.""
'I love them to bits'
Asked whether Line of Duty will return for a seventh series, he said: ""We are in no different position than we have ever been. It's probably just that there's more attention around the show now and more people want to know if we are coming back.
""But we've always left a massive gap between shows - up to two years at a time- so Jed (Mercurio - creator) will just take his time and if he feels there's a story to be told he'll get in touch with us. We'd all love to work together again but just in the right circumstances."" 
Compston has built up a great friendship with Jed Mercurio and fellow Line of Duty Actors Adrian Dunbar and Vicky McClure over the years.
""We've been doing Line of Duty for over 10 years now so they're a massive part of my life,"" he said. ""They are genuinely some of my best friends.""
The group will all be heading to Greenock on Saturday night to take part in a fundraiser for Ardgowan Hospice, which is supported by Compston.
""I got on the phone to the guys and right away the three of them said 'let's do it', he said. ""When it comes to stuff like that I love them to bits - they are all coming up and we'll raise a few quid for the hospice.""

Omar Mehtab asks a ""scalper"" if he thinks stockpiling goods and selling them at higher prices creates unfair competition.
A sudden drop in income, a mounting medical debt and a family to feed left Sheraz (not his real name) struggling to find another way of making money.
During the pandemic his wife lost her job as a beautician, and the government's pandemic support was not easily available to him.
So, he turned to ""scalping"" - an unfavourable term for stockpiling popular products and reselling them at a higher price for profit.
Many sought-after items are resold, including concert tickets, limited-edition trainers and games consoles. 
While the general resale of football tickets is illegal, practically everything else is legal to buy up and resell.
Sheraz says he only sells to his friends and family to make about £250 extra a month, so that he can ""slowly eat away"" at a £50,000 medical bill.
But for a majority of resellers, scalping is big business - and they are using tech to give them an added advantage.
Online bots
A lot of electronics are in short supply because of a global shortage of semiconductor chips, which are essentially the brains of modern electronic products.
Cars, graphics cards, smartphones and games consoles have all been affected. 
The PlayStation 5 - Sony's next-generation games console - has been particularly hard for many gamers to get hold of.
PS5 consoles are still out of stock at most retailers
Some shoppers relied on leaked information from big retailers to predict when new stock might become available. But even those staying up until 03:00 excitedly refreshing a retailer's website would find the stock sold out in minutes.
Real shoppers were being beaten by bots.
Software developed by the scalpers can notify them as soon as stock is available from any of their target websites. Sometimes the bots can even automatically buy items.
The PS5 consoles were being snapped up by bots, only to be resold for twice the regular retail price of £450.
Meeting the scalpers
Jack Bayliss is a 24-year-old former investment banker who started reselling six years ago. His profit margins were huge - sometimes he would buy Yeezy trainers for £150 and sell them for up to £1,000.
He decided to quit his day job and start Aftermarket Arbitrage - a reselling company that teaches others how to scalp. Through subscriptions alone, Mr Bayliss says he has made £456,000 in revenue since starting the company 18 months ago.
For £30 a month, subscribers receive alerts as soon as the bots detect that a rare item is in stock.
The 1,200 subscribers are notified on the Discord app, and can quickly head to the retailer's website to snap up the item.
Asked whether scalping was fair, Mr Bayliss told the BBC: ""If you look at any marketplace, if there is an arbitrage opportunity, people are going to capitalise on it.
""Why would you leave the money on the table?""
Jack Bayliss spoke to BBC Click's Omar Mehtab
Rather than being greedy, Mr Bayliss said scalpers were simply trying to make some extra cash. But for some, he said it was also to make a living.
Reselling to survive
One scalper told the BBC how he cleared a £30,000 gambling debt with the money he earned through scalping. Another said reselling had introduced some structure into his life and helped him cope with alcohol addiction.
Both men declined to be interviewed on camera over concerns for their safety.
Mr Bayliss received many death threats after articles about Aftermarket Arbitrage were published. 
Despite this, Sheraz agreed to be filmed.
""The last two years hasn't been easy for most people,"" he told the BBC.
""I was pretty much rock bottom. If it wasn't for reselling, I wouldn't have a roof over my head.""
""I've got young kids. And when you've got to put food on the table, you've got to do what you've got to do. As long as it's not criminal, which this isn't.""
The bill
Using bots to buy products is not illegal in the UK, but has drawn the attention of lawmakers. 
Douglas Chapman, Scottish National Party MP for Dunfermline and West Fife, is leading the charge against reselling. 
Last year, he introduced a bill to Parliament to ban the resale of electronic goods bought by automated bots.
He says that consumers would benefit from the eventual banning of scalping altogether.
""I think it's skewing the market beyond what's reasonable, and I think we need to look at what are the protections for the consumers,"" he said.
Douglas Chapman MP remains strongly against scalping under any circumstances
He said ""entrepreneurs"" should live ""within the same rules as someone setting up a High Street shop"".
And although it may hurt his own income, Sheraz agrees.
""I do think bots should be stopped. There are some people that will do this 24/7 and will have up to 20 computers set up. They are stockpiling PlayStations and trainers and toys,"" he said.
""It's almost market manipulating.""
Mr Chapman's bill failed to make it through Parliament late last year, but he is planning to renew his bid very soon.
But Mr Bayliss sees it as a matter of supply and demand.
""I wouldn't class not having a PS5 as suffering. There are people out there that want to do more than their nine-to-five. They want a side hustle,"" he said.
""If you see friction between supply and demand, you're going to see someone taking advantage of it.""

Bryn Perry says his Ewe Whey Vodka has a ""creamy finish which can be drunk neat""
As a tractor rumbles past mid-way through our interview, I have to check I haven't misheard. 
""You make your vodka from... sheep's milk?,"" I have to ask.
I hadn't misheard. Award-winning young farmer Bryn Perry, from Haverfordwest in Pembrokeshire, uses an innovative method of recycling leftover whey from his cheese-making in order to produce the spirit.
Before you recoil with a resounding ""yuck"", Bryn insists his Ewe Whey Vodka is very pleasant.
The principle is similar to milk stout, he explains. The sugars in the whey are fermented in order to make a kind of beer, which is then distilled to produce the finished vodka.
Although Bryn and his partner Rebecca Morris describe it as having a ""creamy finish which can be drunk neat"", he says it's by no means a ""milkshake for grownups"".
Chernobyl vodka made in exclusion zone
Can we stomach the latest emerging food innovations?
'Growing Welsh tea isn't easy with our weather'  
'No justification for waste'
Bryn and partner Rebecca keep Dutch sheep because of their higher milk yields
""You tell people you're making vodka from ewes' whey, and they immediately presume it will be a milky, dairy-based drink,"" he said.
""In truth it's quite similar to a normal vodka, but smoother - the sort of thing you might enjoy with some stilton and grapes in place of a port.""
He said the idea came to him after the pain he felt while pouring gallons of whey down the drain.
""Environmentally, financially, morally, there's no justification for wasting any farming by-product these days,"" said Bryn.
""Since setting up, we've been making five different varieties of sheep's milk cheese, but everyday we threw away half of everything we collected from the milking parlour.""
How do you make vodka from sheep milk?
After the curds are separated for use in their cheeses, the leftover whey is transported to the nearby In The Welsh Wind distillery, in Tan-y-Groes, for processing.
It took them a year of tinkering with the recipe before Bryn was awarded the Brinley Williams Memorial Award for best emerging farmer in Wales.
""The precise process is a closely guarded secret - after all the effort we've put into it we're not about to tell everyone how it's done,"" said Bryn.
""We currently use Dutch sheep because they have the best milk yields, but we're in the process of trying to cross-breed them with native Welsh sheep whose feet are hardier for our hilly conditions.""
'Pretty niche'
Bryn first read about the use of sheep whey to make spirits in New Zealand
As proof that fact really is stranger than fiction, the idea of sheep's milk alcohol was mooted on The Archers when gin manufacturer Toby Fairbrother tried to source Borchester Blue cheese producer Helen Archer's discarded whey in order to make milk gin.
But Bryn and Rebecca say they were only the second in Europe to make it a reality.
""I hadn't heard about the Archers storyline,"" he laughed.
""I got the idea from someone in New Zealand, who I think was the first in the world at the time. When I started investigating it there was no-one in Europe making the same thing, though one other company did eventually beat us to market. Even so, we're still pretty niche.""
Putting waste to use in Wales
Bryn and Rebecca's Ewe Whey Vodka is not currently available to buy online, but will be soon
Their vodka is the latest in a growing line of Welsh efforts to reuse by-products which would ordinarily be thrown away.
Pennotec, based in Y Ffôr, near Pwllheli in Gwynedd, are developing a process to use the apple pulp from cider production as a substitute for fat in ready-meals, as well as waste shells from seafood processing as a natural water clarifier for use in filter systems for swimming pools and hydrotherapy.
Meanwhile, after two years of intensive research and experimentation, the Cameron brothers opened Dyfi Distillery, external and use hedge trimmings from local farms to provide botanicals for their gin. 
And distillers Aber Falls, external are using their waste pot ale, which is the precursor to whisky, as fertiliser on local farms, while spent grain is recycled as cattle feed.
Ewe Whey Vodka is currently only available at farmers' markets or direct from Bryn and Rebecca's farm, although they are hoping to have online sales available in time for Mothers' Day.
To find out more, listen to Country Focus on BBC Radio Wales at 07:00 GMT on Sunday, or on BBC Sounds.

324,324,Australia floods: 'I'm angry it's happening again',"Fri, 11 Mar 2022 16:57:06 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-australia-60686223,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-australia-60686223?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,"Australians are reeling from one of their worst natural disasters, but many despair at a sense of déjà vu.","Australia floods: 'I'm angry it's happening again'
Sophia Walter with flood-damaged items on her Brisbane street
In the past two weeks, floods in eastern Australia have killed at least 21 people. Thousands of homes have been left uninhabitable by one of Australia's worst natural disasters.
Wading through filthy, waist-high floodwaters to escape her apartment, Sophia Walter says her first emotion wasn't fear. It was fury.
""What I felt was a real anger. Anger that this was happening again.""
In January 2011, Ms Walter watched ""the hill I lived on turn into an island"" as Brisbane suffered floods described as a once-in-a-century event.
""I remember thinking to myself, well at least I've gotten it out of the way.""
Barely a decade on, she is standing among mountains of abandoned furniture, destroyed electricals and sodden toys, all dumped on the footpath. 
A ""rain bomb"" of intense downpours saw the city's overflowing river and creeks cause billions of dollars of damage. At least five people in Brisbane have died. 
Grim warnings
With impeccable timing, as cars were being submerged, homes inundated and ferry pontoons cascaded wildly downstream, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was publishing its latest update on the state of the planet.
Among its many grim warnings: extreme rainfall (as well as droughts and bushfires) will become more and more common. And the window of opportunity to act is closing fast.
""There's no way people can ignore it anymore,"" says Guy Mansfield, a videographer who scrambled at midnight to save equipment and hard drives before floods consumed his basement office. 
Precious photographs and music memorabilia were lost. A stack of destroyed furniture and books is piled outside the Brisbane home he only bought five years ago.
""It seemed astute to move into a flood area after the last flood, because it's a little bit cheaper and we could afford a place here,"" he says.
""We just thought it might flood again in 30 years or something like that, and we'd totally avoid it. But yeah, here it is. We couldn't believe it.""
Guy Mansfield says he lost many precious items
Flooding on the outskirts of Brisbane earlier this month
Ms Walter - a climate campaigner - aims her anger at Australia's government for being slow to cut carbon emissions and invest in renewables.
""Despite the fact that we're now seeing natural disaster after natural disaster, that this has become the new normal,"" she says.
""I want to see more ambition, I want us to stop subsidising fossil fuels and to take up the job opportunities there can be in regional communities from renewable energy. Instead, it just feels like we're languishing at the bottom of the pile.""
A report published at the COP26 global summit last year backs up that assessment. It ranked Australia last among 60 countries for policy responses to the climate crisis, largely down to a stubborn reliance on coal-powered energy and coal exports.

The paralysis of its climate politics
Why Australia refuses to give up coal
Like any standalone weather event, we can't say how much a changing climate contributed to these specific floods. 
But scientists are united in their view that global warming is making severe floods more likely in northern Australia.
Warmer oceans increase the amount of moisture moving from seas to the atmosphere, says Australia's CSIRO government science agency. That will ""most likely increase the intensity of extreme rainfall events"".
Brisbane got 80% of its average annual rainfall in just three days, with more water dropping on the city than typically falls in London over a year. Sydney has had its wettest start of the year on record. 
But elsewhere in Queensland and New South Wales (NSW), flooding has been even worse. To the north of Brisbane, swollen rivers continue to cut off the town of Gympie. 
In Lismore in northern NSW - where some residents scrambled to roofs and waited for 24 hours or more to be rescued - rebuilding will take years. 
""Australia is getting hard to live in because of these disasters,"" said Prime Minister Scott Morrison on a visit to the town on Wednesday.
""We are dealing with a different climate to the one we were dealing with before. I think that's just an obvious fact.""

Challenged on his climate record, Mr Morrison said the country had committed to reaching net zero by 2050 (though Australia was widely panned for not raising its crucial 2030 targets).
And he repeated his well-worn argument that reducing Australia's 1.3% share of worldwide emissions would achieve little without a global response. 
But campaigners say this ignores that Australia's emissions are large for its population, while also neglecting that stronger action would send a message to the international community. 
""There's been no meaningful climate action in eight years. This is a resounding failure,"" said Amanda Mackenzie, chief executive of the Climate Council.
Reconsidering future
In May, Australians are likely to vote in national elections - the first since the Black Summer bushfires. 
With these floods fresh on the mind, the costs of climate change - environmental, human and financial - seem certain to play a big part.
Flood insurance claims look set to reach A$2bn ($1.5bn), putting them on par with those bushfires.
Mr Mansfield says he is not fully insured, but did at least have some coverage. Neighbours were even less fortunate. 
""A lot of people around here are uninsured. Some companies won't insure you. Those that do, it's just so expensive. You're looking at A$1,000 a month.""
Justine and Jeff Douglas moved into their home in the riverside suburb of Fairfield in December 2010, two weeks before the last major floods. 
Now they're assessing water damage to a basement, that also wrote off a car, and reconsidering their future. 
""In 2011, we were asked if we'd think of moving out and I said, no way,"" says Mrs Douglas.
""But the second time round, yeah, we are. We will.""
Climate will only be one factor at voting time, she adds. During the pandemic, government tax breaks and support for small businesses ""helped us out greatly"".
""It's a tough one. And everyone has to really dig deep and make some really big decisions on where to go from here.""
Jeff and Justine Douglas say this flood will prompt them to move house
For her husband, even water lapping at his door for a second time has not convinced him that more extreme weather is necessarily linked to a warming planet. 
""I neither believe or disbelieve, I'm terribly on the fence with climate change,"" Mr Douglas says.  
""For as long as we know, we've had tragic events. We've had awful floods, we've had awful weather events. I think there needs to be a lot more work done on it.""
But climate scientists say the evidence is clear.
In different times, news of these floods would have made far bigger headlines globally.
""We are all frustrated and we simply have to get the message out that we simply can't afford any more delay,"" says Prof Lesley Hughes, a climate scientist and pro-vice chancellor at Macquarie University. 
""This is the most important existential threat to humanity ever. There are lots of things that grab our attention, like the crisis in Ukraine, and those are shocking tragedies. 
""But in the long term, climate change is it.""

325,325,Ukraine: How China is censoring online discussion of the war,"Sat, 12 Mar 2022 00:14:55 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/60684682,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/60684682?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,The authorities are struggling to keep a lid on pro- and anti-Russian views being discussed online.,"Ukraine: How China is censoring online discussion of the war
China has sought to keep a diplomatic distance from the war in Ukraine, choosing to abstain in a UN vote condemning Russia's invasion.
It is also making concerted efforts to stifle strong views about the conflict on Chinese social-media platforms.
It's a fine line to tread. Only last month, Chinese leader Xi Jinping declared there was ""no limit"" to Beijing's newly strengthened relationship with Russia.
What content is China censoring?
Posts expressing partisan views have been removed on a daily basis - both for and against Russian military action.
""No-one dares to stand with Ukraine right now,"" wrote one person on Weibo, China's Twitter equivalent. ""It's all one-sided support for Russia."" 
This was removed along with many others like it, according to Free Weibo, which tracks Chinese censorship online. 
And a retired Russian general's open letter calling on President Vladimir Putin to step down - shared on the WeChat messaging app prior to the war - has now been blocked.
Some views in support of Russia have also been suppressed. 
A ""thank you"" note posted by the official Weibo account of Russia's state-controlled news network RT, expressing gratitude to the Chinese for their support, was taken down, as was this Weibo post: ""I'm glad that Russia has taken the initiative to undertake the difficult task of fighting the neo-Nazis in Ukraine. The sanctions imposed on Russia are unacceptable."" 
How does China censor social media?
Social-media platforms in China receive constant guidance from the government on how to deal with specific content and are under pressure to follow this.
One such instruction, external was allegedly leaked and reported by the China Digital Times. 
It was said to have been issued to media by the central regulator the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) this month, calling on ""commercial websites, local and self-published media'' not to ""conduct livestreams or use hashtags"" about the Ukraine conflict.
The official Chinese narrative is one of diplomatic neutrality
It also ""strictly prohibited the reposting of foreign media reports"" or putting up ""malicious messages"" favouring one side or another.
China media expert Sarah Cook says: ""It looks absolutely authentic to me. The source is credible and the instructions given match past patterns of media control.""
The platforms have been removing a range of posts seen to be disruptive or dangerous, since the invasion.
Video platform Douyin, China's TikTok equivalent, said last week it had taken down 498 videos and 2,657 comments - citing misinformation and inappropriate messages that ""stir up hatred"" or ""warfare"" - and suspended hundreds of accounts
Weibo said it had suspended tens of thousands of accounts and deleted large numbers of posts that ""mock the situation"" in Ukraine. It also announced it would add geo-location labels to posts to help with verification
The video-streaming site Bilibili said last month it had deleted 1,642 ""inappropriate messages"" and suspended about 57 accounts
WeChat and Bilibili have both urged users to be ""objective"" and ""rational"" when discussing Ukraine
What narrative is China promoting?
Official and mainstream media carry regular reports on the situation in Ukraine but have stopped short of calling Russia's actions a ""war"" or ""invasion"".
Doublethink Lab, which has been tracking disinformation attempts in real time, has pointed out the Chinese media are ""regularly quoting disinformation and conspiracy theories from Russian sources"".  
Chinese television reports about Ukraine do not describe it as a ""war"" or ""invasion""
False claims, such as that the Ukrainians set fire to their own nuclear plant, are repeated by Chinese media with little attempt to challenge them. 
There is also very little reporting on the resistance from the Ukraine side nor the wider Western response to Russia's invasion.
""In my view, the censorship over Ukraine content is imbalanced... with comments and voices that run counter to the official [Chinese] position being much more heavily targeted than other views,"" Ms Cook says. 
Where criticism of events in Ukraine does appear, it is often directed at the United States, placing the blame on it for fanning the flames of the conflict.
In one article published in China's Global Times, the US is accused of profiteering from selling weapons to Ukraine. 
In another, the US is accused of releasing ""disinformation on the Ukraine crisis to smear China"".   
Russia's state-controlled media have a long-standing presence in mainland China, where most foreign news websites are either blocked or heavily censored.
Outlets such as Sputnik have 11.6 million followers on Weibo and are often quoted by Chinese official media as a source in their coverage of the conflict.

Mariia (left) and Tetyana Nesterchuk, two sisters separated by the war in Ukraine
Tetyana Nesterchuk left Ukraine in 1999 to study in England, becoming the first Ukrainian to win a place at Oxford University on a scholarship. 
The London-based barrister's younger sister Mariia took a different path, staying in Ukraine to train as a doctor and later working for the country's authority responsible for drug approval.
They've had their arguments down the years, as all families do, but for Tetyana and Mariia Nesterchuk, the war in Ukraine has caused an unimaginable dispute: whether Mariia should stay or flee.
""I was on the phone to her every day crying, saying, 'please please', and she was crying saying, 'I can't leave Mum behind,"" said Tetyana, 39.
For the first 10 days of the war, Mariia, 36, was in Kyiv, staying in the family apartment alongside her nine-year-old daughter, their mother and brother.
Their mother refuses to leave as she's fled Russian aggression before, when the Russian-sponsored forces invaded Donetsk in Donbas in 2014. Eight years later, and she's not prepared to leave home again. 
""She says she doesn't have the resources, the energy, to go. She said: 'I'm not leaving my home again, I'm never leaving my home',"" said Tetyana.
Mariia and her mother decided to remain in Ukraine
""It was really difficult for me to accept that but at the end of the day, what I said to Mariia was Mum made her decision and we have to respect that. 
""Deciding to become a refugee is not an easy choice. At an age when really you should be enjoying your retirement, running is just not something you want to do and so I've had to accept it. 
""But I couldn't accept Mariia's decision as I said, 'you're responsible for your daughter'. I know she was torn between her child and our mum,"" she said.
At the time, Mariia told her that if they die, they'd all die together, however it was not a bomb that Tetyana was worried about, because if they died from a bomb, it would be ""merciful"".
""It's horrendous because I was thinking, 'what's the worst thing that could happen'? The worst thing isn't that they would die from a direct rocket hit, the worst thing is that they starve,"" she said.
The family were last all together in February - just days before the war began
It wasn't food Mariia was worried about though, but water. 
Every day when there was a period of calm between the air raids, they would run out and buy anything they could eat that didn't need to be cooked. But water was not as easy to get hold of; bottled water had sold out since day one of the war. 
The problem was that water from the taps gets switched off. The family would fill up every container they had but, Mariia explains, the constant worry was when it was coming back again and if they were going to have enough.
Not that they could go to their taps that often as the advice is to have at least two walls between you and the street - so they were living in the corridor of their apartment, with just mattresses placed on the floor.
Mariia eventually made the decision to leave Kyiv with her daughter, leaving her mother and brother there
In the end Mariia and her daughter left Kyiv, to rescue her ex-husband, his seven-year-old daughter, partner and dog from Irpin, an area just north of Kyiv which has come under ferocious bombardment from Russian forces.
""They made a dash for it, they weren't just walking, they were running, because overhead the planes were dropping rockets on people who were escaping,"" said Mariia. 
""There were explosions on each side and they were running,"" said Tetyana. ""It was more than 10km (six miles) before they were able to be picked up by my sister and her partner in a car. That was the last time they could escape Irpin because after that everyone who tried to leave was shot."" 
""It was like being in a film yet it wasn't a film. It was reality. They were running for their lives,"" added Mariia. 
It took the two families - who were crammed into Mariia's small car - three days get to the village in western Ukraine where they're staying now. Not because of the distance, but because it was ""one traffic jam across all of Ukraine"". 
While they were fleeing, Tetyana was at home in London, worried and anxious.
She busied herself trying to find somewhere for them to stay but in the end, they managed to find a place themselves with friends who opened their home to them.
'We are not co-operating': Life in occupied Ukraine
Could Putin be prosecuted for war crimes?
""I think my family have protected me from a lot,"" Tetyana said.
""Every time I call them they have been positive and saying how everything is great, you know everything is fine, so as not to worry me, but I feel helpless. No matter what I do it isn't enough.""
Being thousands of miles away has been tough.
""The worst thing is realising that my nation is being murdered for no reason, that we are a news story.
""Even though they know I'm personally affected, a lot of my acquaintances sort of talk about it to me like they would about any other news story and that actually really hurts because they try to put forward different arguments for and against Nato getting involved but actually for me this is so emotional I can't get involved in the politics,"" she said.
""For me, the answer is pretty clear: you do not kill women and children. He has bombed a maternity hospital in Mariupol. As a woman who has given birth I cannot imagine what that must have been like.""
The sisters both hope to return to their favourite park - Park Peremohy - known as Park of Victory
Although it is incredibly difficult to see the damage being done to Ukraine now, Tetyana cannot impose a news blackout on herself because she is volunteering with Ukrainian Freedom Fund, a humanitarian charity that was established following Russia's invasion of Tetyana's native Donbas and that is now reactivated. It is trying to get medicine, food and other resources to those in need. 
Mariia is helping too - in Ukraine - with the local volunteer organisation.
They receive messages via social media and Telegram channels which they check out before sourcing the aid and sending it to the border. 
Mariia then helps to organise transportation in Ukraine. 
It's provided them both with a useful distraction, a way of coping. 
""The anger and fear has meant I'm able to do a lot more than what I may have been able to have done in peacetime,"" Mariia said.
""At the moment it is a coping mechanism but I'm worried that I'll have a breakdown later on,"" she said. 
""I am too,"" replied Tetyana.
""I understand people who flee, but I have deep respect for Mariia's decision because we need people in Ukraine helping. We can't all just abandon our land,"" said Tetyana. 
The family all have visas so could come to live with her in London, but - for now - they want to stay in Ukraine.
""I will only leave Ukraine in desperate circumstances,"" said Mariia. ""While I can still be helpful, I will stay."" 
Tetyana and her children hosted Mariia and her daughter at Christmas
The last time they were all together was 12 February, when Tetyana and her young children travelled over to Ukraine to celebrate her mother's 60th birthday.
""It was so recent but it feels like it happened in some sort of parallel reality,"" said Mariia. 
""It does feel like it happened in another life, in another country,"" agreed Tetyana. 
For now, aside from volunteering and her job working for Ukraine's drug approval agency - which at the moment she continues to do from where she's now living - Mariia is focusing on home schooling her daughter, just like she did during the pandemic. The only difference is there are no teachers to provide guidance. 
If she could, she would return to Kyiv.
Currently trains are still operating, but it is impossible to drive into the city. Once you've left, you've left. 
""I constantly feel like I want to go back; that feeling doesn't stop,"" Mariia said. 
For now, they're content that they're all still able to contact each other, mainly on the family's WhatsApp chat.
Calls are made twice a day, in the morning and evening.
""I wanted to speak to them all the time,"" said Tetyana. 
""When they were all in Kyiv I would wake up in the morning very early and want to call them straight away but I knew they'd be asleep because they couldn't sleep at night due to the air raids so I'd have to make myself wait until I felt like I could call them. 
""So that was the worst time, in the mornings. 
""Every time I speak to them I think this may be the last time so I definitely don't want to say anything that I'd regret and in that sense I guess you can say we're lucky because sometimes you don't get to. 
""With my dad, he died very suddenly, I didn't know the last time I spoke to him would be the last time. 
""At the moment I treat every time as possibly the last time, so I make sure I say the important things. It made me realise that all the stuff, our material belongings, is not important and in a way I would give it all up for the opportunity to be in Kyiv with my family.""
""In peaceful Kyiv,"" said Mariia.
""Hopefully there'll be a peaceful Kyiv soon,"" replied Tetyana.

Hearings have begun in the public inquiry, external scrutinising the UK's response to, and impacts of, the coronavirus pandemic.
As the virus spread, government agencies increasingly published figures on case numbers, hospitalisations and deaths.
To follow alongside the inquiry, the BBC's data team has broken down some of these statistics into key areas from the beginning of the pandemic up to 5 May 2023, when the World Health Organisation declared an end to the virus as a ""global health emergency"", external.
How many people died?
Just under 227,000 people died in the UK with Covid-19 listed as one of the causes on their death certificate. This includes those who had not been tested for the virus prior to their death.
The most deaths reported in this way on a single day was on 19 January 2021, when 1,490 people were registered.
At this point in the pandemic, the first variant of the virus seen in the UK - initially detected in Kent - was dominant. This was subsequently named the 'Alpha' variant by the WHO.
The UK was also only a month into the first stages of its vaccine rollout, which started to reduce the risk of death and serious illness from the virus.
Another way of looking at the impact coronavirus had on the number of people dying in the UK is by counting all deaths over and above the expected number since the pandemic began, sometimes referred to ""excess deaths"", external. 
As of 5 May 2023, this was over 208,000 deaths. For most of the previous three years there were above average levels of deaths in the UK.

How inquiry is exposing deep flaws in Covid decision-making
What to do if you have Covid: Can you go to work or school?
The highest peaks in the first two years of the pandemic were during periods when many people died directly from Covid. Out of nearly 13,000 excess deaths in mid-April 2020, about 9,500 were attributed to the virus.
But a larger portion of the excess seen in the second half of 2022 were driven by other factors, including flu and pressure on the NHS. Of the 3,300 excess deaths in mid-January 2023, about 600 were from Covid.
Compared with other countries, over the three years to February 2023, the UK's death rates went up by more than 5%, which was more than France, Germany and Spain (all up between 3% and 4.5%), but by less than Italy's (up more than 6%).
The US and Eastern European countries like Poland were even harder hit, with death rates more than 10% above their pre-pandemic levels over the three years to February 2023.
How many people caught the virus?
More than 44 million people in the UK, external were estimated to have had the virus between April 2020 and February 2022, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). This is the most accurate measure available as the total number of infections across the country will never be known.
The ONS ran a regular survey through the pandemic: testing randomly chosen people in order to estimate the number of people who had the virus.
Based on the survey, the estimated peak of the pandemic, in cases if not in deaths, was in late March 2022, where at one point about 4.9 million people were thought to have the virus. However, the survey did not capture the first wave of the pandemic, with trials only beginning in England in April 2020.
Figures are still regularly published on the number of recorded coronavirus cases across the UK, from PCR and lateral flow tests. However, recorded cases are not considered to present the most accurate picture for a variety of reasons, including the availability and reach of testing.
How many people were in hospital?
Patients were admitted to hospital with coronavirus more than 1.1 million times between March 2020 and 5 May 2023 across England, Scotland and Northern Ireland.
These were people who tested positive up to two weeks before arriving at hospital, or while being treated. 
In Wales the figures were counted differently, with about 43,000 admissions of those who either had, or were suspected to have, the virus.
The number of patients in hospital with coronavirus peaked in the week to 20 January 2021, at more than 38,000 people.
When a new national lockdown was announced on 5 January 2021, across hospitals in England about one in four general admission beds were occupied by patients with coronavirus.
This period was the first time the health service had to cope with both normal winter pressures, and the additional strain from Covid, which was spreading among an unvaccinated population with little immunity.
How many people got vaccinated?
The rollout of coronavirus vaccines began in the UK on 9 December 2020, when the world's first Pfizer dose was administered to 90-year-old Margaret Keenan in Coventry.
Since then, nearly 176 million Covid vaccines have been administered in various stages up to May 2023. Starting with older and clinically vulnerable people and moving down the age groups into young adults and some children.
Eligible groups were offered two main doses as a minimum, plus a booster dose, with additional boosters for more vulnerable groups later on in the pandemic.
About 88% of people in the UK over the age of 12 (58 million) are thought to have had both a first and second dose of a vaccine, with 93% receiving a single jab.
This is based on the ONS mid-year population estimates for 2021, and vaccine data from up to 7 May in Scotland and 5 May for the other UK nations.
There is some uncertainty, especially in the proportion of people who did not receive a jab. The choice of population estimate makes a significant difference to the proportion of people thought to be vaccinated.
A small number of people (fewer than one million as of September 2022) aged 5-11 had received a first and second dose of a coronavirus jab. In addition, vaccinated people are removed from the figures after they have died, which could inflate the number considered unvaccinated.

""The beatings. The coldness. You never saw a smile.""
Jimmy Stewart recounts experiences which are piercingly harrowing - but not uncommon.
He is one of thousands of survivors of institutions for children in Northern Ireland, where abuse of young residents was widespread.
When he was eight, Jimmy was taken into Nazareth Lodge in Belfast - a place he quietly describes as ""a nightmare"".
His mother had died of cancer, aged 32. His father was deaf and unable to speak.
""Though he tried to look after us, he couldn't,"" Jimmy says.
WATCH: Ministers deliver long-awaited apology
NEWS: Survivors set for public apology
Q&A: Why has it taken so long to say sorry?
He remembers the nun who met him and his younger brother Patrick at the door called them ""wee mongrels"".  
The boys didn't know what that meant at the time, but later learned it was a reference to his parents' mixed marriage - one was a Catholic, the other a Protestant.
""That's what we got from then on. Any time you got into trouble - you were a mongrel.""
Vivid memories of abuse
Emotional and psychological abuse of this nature was frequently detailed in the report of the public inquiry into historical institutional abuse, published in 2017.
The inquiry, chaired by the late judge Sir Anthony Hart was, at the time, the biggest investigation into the mistreatment of children ever held in the UK.
It also documented sexual and physical abuse, at a number of institutions, mostly run by religious orders.
""Any time you got in trouble - you were a mongrel"" - Jimmy Stewart was abused at institutions for children in Northern Ireland
Jimmy Stewart remembers getting ""the mother and father of all beatings"" after he ran at a nun when she was physically abusing his younger brother, Patrick.
""My hair was pulled, my clothes were ripped off me.""
Abuse survivors set to be given public apology
Q&A: Northern Ireland leaders’ abuse apology
The vivid nature of his memories are clear when he describes how a nun beat him ""with her weapon of choice - a rung from a baby's cot, with piping and light blue paint on it"".
When I have spoken to survivors during their long campaign, I have often noticed how detailed their recollections are - perhaps six or seven decades after the incidents of which they speak.
Jimmy - who is now 68 - was sent to Rubane House in Kircubbin, County Down, run by the De La Salle brothers.
He remembers immediately after he arrived, one of the men told him: ""So you're the tough guy from Belfast. We'll sort you here."" 
There was a swimming pool - but it was a source of terror, not fun.
""They used to take us down and would literally throw us in.
""There was no shallow end.
""The brother would parade round with a stick, and if you dared put your hands near the edge, he would cut the arms and knuckles off you.""
He says there were ""other incidents"" at the home, which he ""can't go into"". 
He still finds swimming pools are a ""trigger"" for flashbacks.
Brother 'changed so much' by abuse
Explaining how he became an alcoholic, Jimmy says: ""If you ask anyone who's a heavy drinker, they'll tell you that you don't dream in a drunken sleep. 
""You don't have nightmares. You don't have flashbacks. It numbs you. Keeps all that stuff away. Until the point it's going to kill you. Which it nearly did to me.""
He describes spending ""three years behind a locked door in my own house"". 
""I hadn't bathed or shaved. I think the last three months I spent in the same bathrobe.""

He began to recover after he went into hospital.
But his older brother, Victor, ""drank himself to death"".
Jimmy becomes particularly emotional when he talks about how Victor was ""so much changed"" by what happened in Rubane House.
""We were always close. But those years took it out of us.""
As an adult, Victor ""couldn't discuss it - he probably didn't think there was any help for him"".
Jimmy regrets deeply that Victor hasn't lived to hear the state apology.
'Why did we have to fight for an apology?'
Many other victims have died during a long campaign - often affected by addiction, a common legacy of their childhood suffering. 
Margaret McGuckin, from Survivors and Victims of Institutional Abuse (Savia), says members of her group are ""emotionally and mentally exhausted"" after almost 15 years of lobbying.
I first spoke to her in 2009, when she phoned into the BBC Northern Ireland newsroom after seeing a TV report I had done featuring two former residents of Nazareth Lodge and Rubane House. 
They had decided to speak out after the inquiry into child abuse in the Republic of Ireland, external set out the extent of suffering in institutions there. 
The Ryan report was one of a series of investigations on the other side of the border, which have uncovered abuse in children's homes, institutions for unmarried mothers and industrial schools. 
The organisations who ran the homes in the Republic were often also in charge of institutions in Northern Ireland. 
Margaret McGuckin says she did not think it would take so long for an official apology to happen
As horrific stories were gradually revealed from the 1990s onwards, there was a growing sense that people who spent time in institutions north of the border were also harbouring dreadful secrets. 
Margaret credits a programme by BBC Northern Ireland's investigative journalism programme Spotlight - called Who Will Say Sorry? - as being an important moment in driving the campaign forward.
She says she did not think it would take so long for an official apology to happen. 
""Why did we have to fight to get to this stage?"" she asks.
Delays caused by NI government's collapse
Savia, and other survivors' groups, first lobbied for a public inquiry, which was then set up by the devolved Northern Ireland government in 2013.
Just days after the Hart report was published in 2017, the power-sharing administration in Belfast collapsed.
The recommendations of the inquiry - including a compensation scheme, an apology and a memorial - were thrown into doubt, causing renewed pain for victims.

They were forced to resort to the courts, to try to get the authorities to implement the report's recommendations.
Devolution remained in the deep-freeze for three years.
The HIA heard evidence from hundreds of people who spent their childhood in residential homes and institutions
Eventually, the UK government in London stepped in to pass legislation to set up the financial redress scheme.
Earlier this year, a date was finally set for a state apology.
That, too, seemed to be in danger after another political crisis.
But the five parties who make up the power-sharing coalition have agreed that one minister from each of them will make statements of apology on behalf of the state.
Survivors will be in the chamber of the Northern Ireland Assembly, as politicians and then representatives of the organisations who ran institutions tell them they are sorry.
Margaret McGuckin says: ""We're going to be looking at them as they look at us, hopefully in the eye, and say - what we did to you was not your fault. It was ours. We let you down. We neglected you. 
""We didn't listen to you when you cried out for help.""
A story not fully told
She will be with her brother, Kevin, who has been in long-term care for many years.
""He was raped and repeatedly abused - mentally, physically and emotionally - in Nazareth Lodge and Rubane House.
""He probably thought it was all his fault, that he was complicit in the acts, because they gave him sweets.
""He couldn't live on the outside, because he was carrying these secrets.""
Margaret McGuckin and Jimmy Stewart speaking to BBC News NI's Chris Page
She hopes that news of the apology will reach former residents of institutions across the world - and encourage them to ""speak to someone"" and ""remember it's not your fault"". 
""Don't take that shame and that blame upon you any longer,"" she adds.
The distressing history of institutionalisation across the island of Ireland has not been fully told.
In Northern Ireland, campaigners are continuing to call for a public inquiry to specifically examine sex abuse by members of the clergy. 
The devolved government has agreed to set up an inquiry into ""mother-and-baby homes"" - where unmarried mothers were sent, and often made to give up their babies for adoption.
In the Republic of Ireland, legislation is being brought forward to allow for the excavation of the mass grave site at the site of a home in Tuam in County Galway, where hundreds of children are thought to be buried. 
Not every survivor believes a state apology matters.
But for Jimmy Stewart, it is ""huge"".
""We were faceless, nameless, voiceless,"" he tells me.
""This apology is owed, big time.""
If you have been affected by any of the issues in this report, support is available at the BBC Action Line.
You can watch the official apology from Stormont live on the BBC News NI website from 12:30 GMT on Friday.

329,329,Cost of living: What Tory MPs want from Rishi Sunak,"Fri, 11 Mar 2022 14:58:59 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-60705352,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-60705352?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,"MPs are not short of ideas for the chancellor to help struggling families, but all come at a price.","Cost of living: What Tory MPs want from Rishi Sunak
Rishi Sunak is set to make a statement against a backdrop of rising prices
 Conservative MPs have been breaking ranks with the government to demand action on the rising cost of living as the global economy reels from shocks including the war in Ukraine.
They have been appealing to Chancellor Rishi Sunak ahead of his spring economic statement on 23 March.
The BBC understands Mr Sunak is considering options to ease the squeeze on budgets before a rise in energy bills and a tax hike from April.
As MPs pressure him to act, we assess some of their proposals, and their likelihood of being adopted.
Relief from green taxes
A record rise in global gas prices, driven by high demand and tight supplies, has sent energy costs skyrocketing.
One consequence is a new UK price cap, which will increase energy bills by about £700 a year from 1 April.
Energy regulator Ofgem estimates, external about 8% of those bills will go towards environmental taxes, which fund home insulation and renewable power.
A campaign to scrap these so-called green levies is being led by Craig Mackinlay, the chairman of the Net Zero Scrutiny Group, which is urging the government to rethink its climate policies.
Can the UK afford its net zero policies?
Keeping green levies, Mr Mackinlay told the BBC, would be ""politically very bad"" because voters will ""think the government isn't really on my side"".
How likely?
Government insiders have suggested this was ""not a go-er"".
The money raised from green levies is tied up in contracts to curb carbon emissions in partnership with the private sector. One government source argued that the taxpayer would have to cover the costs of these contracts if they were cancelled. 
While sceptics have pointed to Germany, whose coalition of Greens, Social Democrats and liberals has moved to scrap a renewables levy, government sources stress they are still committed to the UK's net-zero target.
Fuel duty cut 
Fuel prices have soared to record highs since the invasion of Ukraine, leaving motorists astonished by ever-high prices at petrol pumps.
On 1 March, the average price for a litre of unleaded petrol was 151.67p - compared to 123.58 on that date a year earlier, according to motoring services firm RAC, external.

To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.
""A year's worth of petrol price rises in six days""
This dramatic increase ""is not hurtling down the track, it is here already"", Tory MP and fuel campaigner Robert Halfon has warned.
He said surging fuel costs would have consequences for businesses, public services and the increasing price of everyday items, known as inflation.
Mr Halfon has urged the chancellor to: 
Cut fuel duty, which currently stands at 57.95p per litre and has been frozen by Conservative chancellors for years
Introduce a Pumpwatch monitor to ""protect motorists from the rapaciousness of big oil companies that jack up the price"" when global demand is high
How likely?
The murmurings about increasing pump prices are getting louder among MPs - and ministers are noticing. 
One government source claimed it was now being raised more with them than energy bills. The transport industry has also lobbied for a cut to fuel duty. 
The official line from the Treasury is that all taxes are kept under review, and the existing 2022-23 fuel duty freeze saves consumers ""almost £8bn over the next five years"". 
But some government insiders admit the arguments against a cut are less clear and they are watching how prices develop over the year closely.
Tax policy will not be updated in the chancellor's spring statement, but the door to further intervention on fuel prices isn't necessarily completely shut.
Universal credit top-up
For almost six million people claiming universal credit, a £20 top-up to help families through the pandemic was withdrawn last October.
The cut was an emotive issue that, according to one think tank, external, would determine whether 500,000 more people fell into poverty or not.
More on the cost of living:
EXPLAINED:Why are energy bills so high?
PRICES:Cost of petrol hits fresh record
WARNING:UK faces biggest income squeeze in decades
APPEAL:Campaigner says families need urgent help
Before the top-up was abolished, some Tory MPs joined Labour in calling for the extra £20 to be made permanent. Among them was Peter Aldous who, in August last year, told the BBC the cut would ""cause an awful lot of problems to a lot of people"".
More recently, Conservative peer Lord Forsyth said the uplift should be restored ""in the name of humanity"".
How likely?
The government's response to these calls was to cut the universal credit taper rate, which meant people on benefits could keep more of what they earn. 
This appeased some vocal Tory MP critics at the time, some of whom felt this struck a balance between incentivising work and making benefits more generous. 
Facing fresh calls to pull this lever further, government insiders have stressed they are conscious of the financial squeeze on those on middle incomes, as well as the poorest households. 
That was the thinking behind the recently announced energy bills rebate, which about 80% of households will receive. 
Scrap National Insurance hike?
Mr Sunak has attempted to position himself as a ""tax-cutting"" Conservative in the mould of his political idol, former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.
But his Thatcherite credentials have been under scrutiny following a £12bn hike in National Insurance (NI).
In April, the policy will see NI contributions rise by 1.25% to fund social care and health services in England.
Tory critics who hold seats in Labour heartlands in northern England have said the increase will have a disproportionate impact on the lower-paid.
The first £12,570 of their income should be exempt from NI, the Northern Research Group of Tory MPs - led by Jake Berry - has suggested.
Several veteran Conservative MPs have been more vociferous in their opposition to the tax. 
One, former Conservative leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith, has said the increase would slow down the economy, while another David Davis, has told the BBC the tax would be ""a disincentive to work"".
How likely?
While nothing can ever be ruled out in politics, we can be pretty certain this is not going to happen. Both the prime minister and chancellor have been definitive that they will not backtrack on this policy, and government sources say it is ""off the table"".
Freeze energy price cap
As the Bank of England warned of the biggest fall in living standards in decades, the chancellor announced a plan he said would ""take the sting"" out of higher bills.
In February, Sunak promised a £150 council tax rebate for properties in bands A to D, and a £200 cut to energy bills in October, to be repaid over five years.
Tory MP Stephen McPartland told the BBC the schemes were ""obviously a step forward as it is some support, but we have to find a way to insulate families from these huge costs"".
One solution, he said, would involve keeping the energy price cap at the current level. This could be done by offering loans worth £25bn to energy firms.
These loans would ""smooth out the volatility"" in energy prices and allow them to spread the rise in bills over time.
The BBC understands Mr McPartland has raised this idea with cabinet ministers.
How likely?
No 10 asked the business secretary to come forward with a series of proposals to ease energy bills.
These included changes to the chancellor's rebate scheme, such as doubling the loan, delaying repayments or making it more generous for poorer households. 
But Treasury sources have rejected calls to tweak the existing scheme. While some ministers have been more receptive to Mr McPartland's idea of a ""credit facility"", government sources have steered away from this.
A windfall tax on oil and gas firms
On the opposition benches, one idea that has been floated is a one-off tax on profits made by oil and gas firms.
Dubbed a ""windfall tax"", the measure has been backed in various forms by Labour, the Liberal Democrats and some Tory MPs.
Labour's version involves increasing corporation tax by 10 percentage points for North Sea oil and gas producers from April.
This, Labour says, would raise £1.2bn, which could be used to help households struggling to cope with the 54% rise in energy bills from April.
Labour would do this by:
Getting rid of VAT on domestic fuel bills (currently 5%)
Increasing the warm homes discount from £140 to £400
Extend this discount to nine million families, up from the 2.2 million that currently receive it
Some Tories support slashing VAT on energy bills, and making the warm homes discount more generous.
Lib Dems meanwhile have backed the latter, and also demanded an emergency 2.5% cut to VAT, which they say would ""put an average of £600 back into the pockets of UK families"".
Cut VAT to tackle cost-of-living, Lib Dems tell Sunak
How likely?
The Treasury is not keen on cutting VAT on energy bills because it is untargeted - and believes it would only help people out to the tune of £7 when the energy price gap goes up in April.
One government source said it would be ""politically"" difficult to backtrack on this given it has already been publicly ruled out. 
Its proponents argue VAT raised from rising fuel or energy prices could be put towards cutting this, but a Treasury spokesperson said there ""has been no 'VAT windfall' and receipts this year are forecasted to be £2 billion below the amount collected directly before the pandemic"".
Ministers also are not keen on a windfall tax for energy firms because they fear it would ""deter investment"" in North Sea energy production at a time when the government is trying to source more energy domestically.

330,330,Raducanu into Indian Wells third round with win over Garcia,"Sat, 12 Mar 2022 06:45:08 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/tennis/60715920,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/tennis/60715920?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,"Emma Raducanu gets past Caroline Garcia, while fellow Brit Harriet Dart overcomes Elina Svitolina to reach the third round at Indian Wells.","Indian Wells: Britons Emma Raducanu and Harriet Dart through to third round
Emma Raducanu was given a first-round bye in California
Emma Raducanu beat Caroline Garcia of France 6-1 3-6 6-1 at Indian Wells to reach the third round.
The 19-year-old British number one raced into a 3-0 lead and, after saving four break points in the fifth game, impressively took the first set.
Garcia broke Raducanu three times on the way to levelling before the US Open champion cruised through the third set.
Fellow Briton Harriet Dart beat former world number three Elina Svitolina 2-6 6-3 6-3 to join her in round three.
The 12th-seeded Ukrainian broke the 25-year-old four times in the opening set before the British number three fought back to win the next two sets and claim victory in two hours 17 minutes.
Qualifier Dart, who is ranked 122nd in the world, faces Estonia's Kaia Kanepi in the next round while  Raducanu takes on Petra Martic of Croatia.
Murray beats Daniel for 700th ATP win
Raducanu, who is 13th in the world rankings, said it ""means a lot to have come through"" in three sets against former world number four Garcia.
""I thought the level of tennis was pretty high. It could have gone either way,"" said Raducanu.
""She plays extremely powerfully and fast so as soon as I let up in the second set she climbed on top of it straight away.
""I knew I had to make some adjustments in the third set so I'm really happy that I was able to work that out in the match and come through a tough one.""
Raducanu was compromised by a blister when going out in the second round at the Australian Open, and had been able to play only four matches so far this year before facing world number 66 Garcia.
She also had to retire with a leg injury when playing Daria Saville in Guadalajara two weeks ago and there were doubts she would be fit to play in California.
However, Raducanu came through some testing moments against Garcia - in a match lasting one hour 31 minutes - before earning victory.
Meanwhile, Dayana Yastremska and her 15-year-old sister Ivanna were were beaten 6-1 6-1 by Irina Camelia-Begu and Monica Niculescu of Romania in the first round of the doubles competition.
The Ukrainian sisters were competing together for the second time since they fled their home city of Odesa last month following the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
Dayana, 21, who reached the singles final of the Lyon Open last week was knocked out in the first round of the singles event at Indian Wells on Thursday.

Murray claims landmark 700th win
Andy Murray fought back from a set down to beat Taro Daniel 1-6 6-2 6-4 in the first round at Indian Wells as he secured a 700th win on the ATP Tour.
The Briton passed up two break points in the third game before Daniel took the first set in 28 minutes.
A more aggressive Murray won the second set only to drop his serve in the first game of the decider.
Murray regrouped, levelled at 3-3 with a brilliant forehand and broke Daniel at 5-4 up to take the match.
He will now play Kazakhstan's world number 33 Alexander Bublik in the next round.
Raducanu into Indian Wells third round with win over Garcia
""It means a lot,"" Murray told BBC Sport about reaching 700 wins. 
""I didn't have goals like that, even four or five years ago, but obviously after what's happened these last few years these are like small milestones. 
""At the end of last year my goal was to try and reach 800 match wins, but first things first, let's try and get to 700. 
""In my best years I was winning 65-80 matches, so if I was winning 40-50 matches for the next couple of years, it's certainly doable. I think I'm on nine wins this year and I'm not really playing that well.""
The match was the third time Murray had played Japan's Daniel this year.
Daniel came out on top in the second round at the Australian Open before Murray won at the Qatar Open.
Liam Broady, meanwhile, failed to progress past the first round, losing 6-4 4-6 6-4 to Serbia's Miomir Kecmanovic.
Daniel 'came out really hot'
In California, world number 88 Murray's failure to take either of the two break points in the third game of the first set seemed to give Daniel, who is 106 in the men's rankings, more confidence.
Daniel broke Murray to love in his next two service games to take a 5-1 lead and was making his opponent look lethargic as he served out to convincingly win the opening set in 28 minutes.
Murray responded by breaking his opponent in the first game of the next set and gave a fist pump after securing a double break to go 4-0 up.
More winners were coming from Murray's racquet as he benefitted from a more positive approach and he took the second set to level the match.
Murray lost a fourth service game to love in the first game of the decider and threw his cap down in frustration when he sent a high volley wide in the fifth game.
But he regained his composure and went on to make it 3-3 with a forehand winner.
Murray saved a break point in the ninth game with a brave second serve that was too much for Daniel to handle and he gave out a roar when he held to go 5-4 up.
Daniel, who completely missed a smash in the first set, shanked another on the first point as he served to stay in the match and, while he saved two match points, he could not do so a third time as Murray won in one hour and 58 minutes.
""He [Daniel] had a couple of matches in the qualifiers and he came out really hot but I was giving him that opportunity by leaving the ball short,"" said Murray. 
""As the match went on, I started to get closer to the baseline, timing the ball better and I figured it out. It wasn't easy.""
Murray will get back together with former coach Ivan Lendl after the Miami Masters later this month.
""He [Lendl] said good luck today - that's what I got,"" said Murray.
""We've spoken a bit in the last couple of weeks. We're officially starting after Miami. We're hoping he's going to be able to come along and watch my matches at the tournament there.""

Fitzpatrick completed all five of her events in Beijing
Britain's Menna Fitzpatrick missed out on another Winter Paralympic medal by 0.45 seconds  as she finished fourth in the visually impaired slalom.
The defending champion was fifth - 0.87secs off the podium - after her first run in Beijing.
But despite a superb second run with guide Gary Smith, she was unable to add to the silver and bronze she won earlier in the Games. 
Austrian sisters Veronika and Barbara Aigner took gold and silver.

Veronika, 19, guided by another sibling Elisabeth, was 1.71secs clear of 16-year-old Barbara to win her second gold after victory in Friday's giant slalom, while Slovakian Alexandra Rexova, 16, took bronze.
Fitzpatrick's team-mate Millie Knight was eighth in what was her guide Brett Wild's final race before he retires to return to his career in the Navy and begin officer training, while in the women's seated event, Shona Brownlee finished her maiden Paralympic campaign in ninth.
The 42-year-old took a tumble during her first run but was able to get back upright on her sitski and continue.
Arnold takes to the slopes
Nordic skier Steve Arnold finally made a belated Paralympic debut, finishing 29th in the men's cross country middle distance seated event.
The 42-year-old had to delay his departure to the Games after a positive Covid test.
Arnold lost both his legs in 2011 while serving in Afghanistan
Once he subsequently received a negative test result he was able to travel, only to again test positive when he landed in China.
However, he was released from isolation early on Saturday in time to compete in his final scheduled race.
In tricky conditions, Scott Meenagh was the leading Briton in 16th with Callum Deboys 20th and Steve Thomas 32nd in a race in which China won gold and silver.
In the women's seated race, Hope Gordon, GB's first female Nordic skier, also found the going tough in 16th.

If England beat Ireland, we have a chance to win a trophy and that's all I can ask for - Jones
Guinness Six Nations: England v Ireland
Venue: Twickenham Date: Saturday, 12 March Kick-off: 16:45 GMT
Coverage: Listen on BBC Radio 5 Live and BBC Radio Ulster; text commentary and highlights on BBC Sport website and mobile app.
""They beat us and they beat us up.""
In the bowels of the Aviva Stadium, Joe Schmidt's post-mortem was blunt.
His Ireland side, full of momentum after an autumn win over the All Blacks, had been brought to a juddering halt. The opposition were an unfancied England side that had finished fifth in the previous year's Six Nations.
Physicality had bridged the gap. Brute power had upset the odds.
That was the verdict. And that was 2019. 
Three years on, the approach to Saturday's Twickenham meeting is eerily familiar.
Time for England to show attacking edge - Dawson
Listen to Rugby Union Daily's round four preview
England 'optimistic' unwell Itoje will play
Ireland's plan to overcome Twickenham factor
Once again, Ireland are upwardly mobile; their smart, quick rugby straining defences with a blizzard of options and different plays.
And England, as in early 2019, are groping in the dark. Fans try and plot progress from a pebbledash mix of performances. Players point to moments in matches, rather than offering a clear 80-minute vision. Where they stand in the world order remains frustratingly unclear.
Amid the doubt and uncertainty, the same spirits that haunted Schmidt in the 2019 Aviva aftermath have been summoned once again.
The mood music from the England camp has all been heavy metal. 
""They haven't played a game as physical as this for a long time,"" promised coach Eddie Jones.
""Big lads putting in big shots and big carries,"" said centre Henry Slade when asked what the current team could learn from their past success.
Henry Slade scored two tries in England's 32-20 win in Dublin in 2019
It's isn't just blind bluster. There is more evidence to suggest route one is the surest way to victory against Ireland.
Eleven of Ireland's starting XV play their provincial rugby together at Leinster, including six of the eight forwards.
You can see Ireland's cohesion in well-worn running lines, the array of intricate attacking moves, the instinctive way players feed off each other. By contrast, England's starting XV is drawn from eight Premiership clubs.
But, the Leinster connection also gives a glimpse of underbelly.
Because Leinster's European Champions Cup campaigns have ended in similar ways over the past three seasons. Each time, La Rochelle and Saracens' powerful packs squeezed them into submission.
Could Ireland's attacking patterns be similarly scattered at Twickenham?
Perhaps. France's relentless carries eventually sapped Ireland's spirit in Paris a month ago after all.
But England are not France. Not by a long way. Through a mix of accident and design, Saturday's team is built for a different game.

The slighter, swifter Sam Simmonds starts at eight after Alex Dombrandt's brush with Covid.  
Tom Curry's time on the ball will be eaten up by repelling Tadhg Beirne and Peter O'Mahony at the breakdown. 
Manu Tuilagi's latest injury absence robs England of the midfield punch Bundee Aki gives Ireland. Max Malins will be giving up height and weight to James Lowe on the wing. 
The cavalry looks to be weighted the visitors' way as well, with four recent British and Irish Lions - Iain Henderson, Jack Conan, Conor Murray and Robbie Henshaw - on the Ireland bench.
Instead England will have to rely on something else. Something that, behind the headline-grabbing kilowatt power, was there in spades in the 32-20 win in Dublin in 2019.
You could see it in the opening 90 seconds. The accuracy of Jamie George's line-out throw over the back. The ambition in Owen Farrell's mis-pass to Elliot Daly. The ruthlessness of Jonny May's finish.
England set about Ireland with power that day, but also with a plan. Backed into a corner, England came out fists raised and a clutch of jokers up their sleeve as well.
George, one of six survivors from that win, has hinted that something similar maybe brewing this time around.
""We are going to throw a few different things at Ireland and try and make them uncomfortable,"" he told Rugby Union Daily earlier this week.
""There is a sense of excitement around that, there really is.""
If they back up that talk with a win, it could be a turning point. A performance, like in Dublin three years ago, that gives direction, impetus and belief to a team in need of all three. 
A victory that could forge them together and fire them towards a final-weekend match against France, with proof of what's possible.
The alternative is stark. Rather than a title decider in Paris, a defeat would have Jones' side scrapping to avoid a second-straight fifth place finish.
It was a defeat by Ireland that confirmed last year's dismal standing. The morning after a tame 32-18 defeat in Dublin, Jones tore into his squad. 
Over breakfast he told his players their credit had run out. All bets were off, all comers would be considered. Ollie Lawrence, Ben Earl, Dan Robson, and Mako and Billy Vunipola were shuffled to the door and a revamped 'New England' was ushered in.
The fresh era still lacks a defining performance. Saturday, 18 months out from the start of France 2023, is high time it arrived.

Desperate new attempts to evacuate civilians from towns and villages around Kyiv are under way
Fresh attempts to evacuate civilians from cities under siege in Ukraine are being complicated by constant Russian shelling, Ukrainian officials say.
Humanitarian corridors are being set up from Mariupol, Sumy and towns and villages outside the capital Kyiv.
But Ukraine officials accused Russian forces of firing on a convoy of women and children from Peremoha village, near Kyiv, killing seven.
And the evacuations come as fighting continues around Kyiv and other cities.
""A column of civilians, exclusively women and children, was fired on by the occupiers,"" a statement by Ukraine's military intelligence service said. ""The result of this barbaric act was seven killed, one of whom was a child.""
The BBC's Abdujalil Abdurasulov in Irpin, one of the towns outside the capital being evacuated, earlier reported that it was not possible to say that the humanitarian ceasefire was holding because of explosions and artillery fire, including from the Ukrainian side, could still be heard.
Regional officials also said that fighting in the area was continuing and that there was a constant threat of air attacks.

Ukraine's Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk later said that about 13,000 Ukrainians had been evacuated through humanitarian corridors on Saturday but that no one had managed to leave Mariupol. 
The situation in Mariupol is particularly desperate after two weeks of bombardment, the UN has said, with little access to food, water and power. 
""Medicines for life-threatening illnesses are quickly running out, hospitals are only partially functioning, and the food and water are in short supply,"" the Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs said.
Deputy Mayor Serhiy Orlov told the BBC a convoy had left Zaporizhzhya for the city carrying aid and that it included buses for the evacuations.
Previously, he said, convoys were ""not let through, they were bombed, the road was mined, there was shelling in the town"".
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said that about 1,300 of his country's troops had died since the start of the Russian invasion. 
Russia invaded Ukraine on 24 February, arguing that it felt threatened by a neighbour intent on joining Western-led organisations such as the Nato military alliance. 
The latest key developments:
Clashes outside Kyiv: Intense fighting is raging on the outskirts of the capital as British intelligence says the bulk of Russian forces are within 25km of the centre. Ukrainian officials fear the Russians may be preparing to launch a large-scale assault
Key cities encircled: Sirens and explosions have been heard in many other cities across Ukraine. The besieged cities of Kharkiv, Mariupol, Mykolaiv and Sumy have been enduring relentless shelling as well as freezing temperatures
Fresh air attacks: New artillery and air attacks have also taken place on the cities of Dnipro and Kropyvnytskyi
Arms supply warning: Russia has warned that Western arms convoys delivering weapons to Ukraine could be ""legitimate targets"" for the Russian armed forces
Fury at mayor's abduction: Hundreds of residents have taken to the streets of the south-eastern city of Melitopol to protest against the abduction of its mayor by Russian forces
New talks: The leaders of France and Germany have been holding another round of phone talks with Russia's President Vladimir Putin
Exodus mounts: The conflict has now sent 2.5 million Ukrainians fleeing to neighbouring countries. Poland says more than 1.6 million people have fled there, while Moldova says it has reached a ""breaking point"" in its ability to cope with refugees

Watch: UK government minister says he is looking into using sanctioned oligarchs' houses for refugees
Households in the UK will be offered £350 a month to open their homes to people fleeing the war in Ukraine.
Housing Secretary Michael Gove told the BBC tens of thousands of people could come to the UK under the scheme and he may offer a room to a refugee.
But the Refugee Council is concerned about the level of support for those traumatised by war.
Labour said there were unanswered questions, accusing the government of ""dragging its feet"" over the crisis.
Under the Homes for Ukraine scheme, people will be able to nominate a named individual or a family to stay with them rent-free, or in another property, for at least six months. A website to express an interest in being a sponsor will launch on Monday.
Mr Gove also told the BBC's Sunday Morning programme the government was looking at using the properties of Russian oligarchs sanctioned by the UK for ""humanitarian purposes"" but there was ""quite a high legal bar"" and this measure would lapse as sanctions ended.
Retailers Sainsbury's, Marks & Spencer and Morrisons are among the UK companies offering to employ Ukrainian refugees. 
Asos said it wanted to attract Ukraine's strong technology engineering skill set, while soap shop Lush said it would open up internal vacancies to refugees.
Addressing a rally outside Downing Street on Sunday, Ukraine's ambassador to the UK, Vadym Prystaiko, called for more support, weapons and humanitarian assistance.

Local authorities will also receive £10,500 in extra funding per refugee for support services - with more for children of school age, the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities said.
More than 2.5 million people have so far fled Ukraine because of Russia's invasion, in what the UN has called the fastest-growing refugee crisis since World War Two.
The government has faced criticism - including from its own MPs - over the speed and scale of its response.
Defending the government's response, Mr Gove told the BBC the number of Ukrainians fleeing the war who had been granted visas had now risen to 3,000. 
There is no sign of any end to the war in Ukraine, now in its 18th day
At the moment, only those fleeing the conflict who have family connections in the UK are able to make an application via the Ukraine Family Scheme. Other visas are available but application centres in Ukraine are closed., external
Under the new scheme sponsors in the UK will not be required to know the refugees in advance and there will be no limit on numbers. Ukrainians on the scheme will be given leave to remain for three years, with the right to work and access public services.
Mr Gove told the BBC that he anticipated ""tens of thousands"" of Ukrainians might be taken in by UK families with the first arrivals ""within a week"".

On the Bafta 2022 red carpet, Stephen Graham and Benedict Cumberbatch were seen wearing Ukraine-coloured badges 
Applications will be made online, with both sponsors being vetted and refugees having to go through security checks. The sponsor will get a ""thank you"" payment of £350 a month.
Asked if he would take a Ukrainian refugee into his home, Mr Gove said ""yes"" and that he was ""exploring what I can do"".
""Without going into my personal circumstances, there are a couple of things I need to sort out - but yes,"" he added.
In a later phase of the scheme, organisations such as charities and churches will also be able to sponsor refugees, though there is no start date for this yet.
Two weeks since it was announced, we now have some details of the scheme allowing people to host refugees in their homes. 
The idea is a simple one, but the practicalities of matching those fleeing Russia's invasion with willing households in the UK won't be easy. 
Aiming to place people with hosts within a fortnight is ambitious and the system is untested. 
Ministers are keen to avoid using hotels or other temporary accommodation used by Afghans last year, and are adamant that security checks should stay in place on those fleeing Ukraine.
But for some Conservative MPs, let alone Labour and other opposition parties, the government's response has fallen short. 
And it's no accident that Michael Gove - and not the Home Secretary Priti Patel - is fronting the latest efforts to smooth out and speed up the process of settling people in the UK. 
What ministers have described as a cross-government approach has looked at times like inter-departmental wrangling over who's best placed to get things done. 
The Refugee Council - a charity supporting refugees and asylum seekers in the UK - said it was concerned people from Ukraine were facing further ""bureaucratic hurdles"", and the government scheme fell short of what was needed.
Claiming formal refugee status, or permission to stay for humanitarian reasons through the asylum system, does not require a visa and allows an applicant and their dependants to stay in the UK for five years, with the right to work, study and apply for benefits.
Why I want to share my home with a Ukrainian refugee
For the third time in a year, John Rutherford and his wife Sue are considering opening up their south London house to a refugee.
""We have a big house, my kids have left home,"" says John. ""It's not a great hardship for us to make some space for a refugee.""
John Rutherford and his wife have previously hosted refugees from Ethiopia and Iran
In 2021, they hosted one person from Ethiopia and one from Iran, each for a couple of weeks while they awaited longer-term accommodation during the asylum application process.
And now, he is ready to open his five-bedroom house again.
""It was the sheer numbers involved that made me want to help... there could be four or five million people looking for places to stay, so the UK has to do its bit and the British people have to do their bit.""

Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer told Sky News the government's visa schemes have been ""too slow, too narrow, too mean"", adding that the government had not consulted local councils about the support that needs to be put in place.
""Frankly the last few weeks have been an embarrassment to the United Kingdom in terms of refugees,"" he said.
Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey has said Home Secretary Priti Patel should be sacked for the government's response to Ukrainian refugees.
""The incompetence, indifference and sheer inhumanity we have seen from the home secretary does not befit our United Kingdom, with its proud history of providing sanctuary to those in need,"" he told the party's spring conference in York.
A government spokesperson responded to Sir Ed's comments by saying ""the facts do not support these accusations"", and repeating a claim that the UK had ""resettled more refugees through safe and legal routes than any other European country"" since 2015.
As BBC Reality Check reported this week, while this specific claim is true, the overall picture is very different - as some other European countries have taken in far more refugees than the UK since 2015.
The first ministers of Scotland and Wales have written to the UK government to propose that their nations go further with the new scheme.
The European Union is allowing Ukrainians three-year residency without a visa, but the UK says controls on entry are essential for security.

The Republic of Ireland's prime minister Micheal Martin told the BBC's Sunday Morning show that his country had taken in 5,500 Ukrainian refugees but had not carried out any security checks on entry.
Meanwhile, celebrities including actors Benedict Cumberbatch and Stephen Graham have shown their support for Ukraine at the Bafta Awards 2022, under way in central London.

A rabbi who helped Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich obtain his Portuguese citizenship has been told he cannot leave Portugal and must present himself to authorities when required.
Daniel Litvak was detained on Thursday as part of an investigation into how citizenship had been granted. 
The naturalisation process of several Jewish people is being investigated.
On Friday, Mr Abramovich was sanctioned by the UK in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
Mr Abramovich, 55, is the owner of Chelsea FC and he is one of seven oligarchs to be hit with fresh sanctions, including asset freezes and travel bans.
The Premier League has disqualified him as a director of the club.
Mr Abramovich was granted Portuguese citizenship in April 2021 under a law that offered naturalisation to descendants of Sephardic Jews, who were expelled from the Iberian peninsula more than 400 years ago during the Inquisition.
Applicants for Portuguese citizenship via this route are assessed by experts at one of Portugal's Jewish communities in either Lisbon or Porto. Mr Litvak is the rabbi for the community in Porto (northern Portugal) and was responsible for assessing Mr Abramovich's application. 
Mr Litvak was detained by authorities as he was preparing to travel to Israel. He was asked to hand over his passport and will have to periodically present himself to authorities. 
Portugal's Judicial Police and public prosecutor said on Friday that there were suspicions of money laundering, corruption, fraud and falsification of documents in the process of of granting citizenship to descendants of Sephardic Jews.
Porto's Jewish community has denied any wrongdoing and said it was the target of a smear campaign. They added that Mr Litvak oversaw the department that grants certification of an individual's Sephardic Jewish heritage and the criteria used for granting someone Portuguese nationality had ""been accepted by successive governments"".

Protesters blocked traffic outside of the Met Police headquarters New Scotland Yard
Protesters demanding ""radical change"" to the Metropolitan Police have marched through central London.
Activists held traffic outside New Scotland Yard before marching to Charing Cross Police Station.
They carried banners reading ""police are perpetrators"", set off bright blue smoke flares and said they activated 1,000 rape alarms.
The protest marks a year since an unofficial gathering to pay respects to Sarah Everard saw clashes with police.
It also comes a day after judges ruled police breached the rights of the organisers of a planned vigil for Sarah Everard.
Ms Everard was murdered by a serving Met officer, Wayne Couzens.
The Met has previously said it is trying to rebuild trust with the public after several misconduct cases involving its officers.
About 300 demonstrators from various groups chanted ""racist police, sexist police"" while walking towards Trafalgar Square and Charing Cross Police Station. 
Patsy Stevenson, who was arrested at a vigil for Sarah Everard in the days following her murder last year, said ""radical change from the whole of the policing system"" was needed.
Gina Cane of Sisters Uncut, a feminist activist group who organised the protest, said: ""We reject the authority of the police, a racist misogynist institution built on coercion and control."" 
Demonstrators were also protesting against the the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill
Protesters set off blue smoke flares as they walked through central London
Sarah Everard was murdered last March
Protesters also said they opposed the Police, Crime and Sentencing Bill, external which, if passed, would give police greater powers to control protests.
Ms Everard was kidnapped in south London on 3 March 2021 as she was walking home from a friend's house. Her attacker was sentenced to a whole-life term after pleading guilty to murder. 
A spontaneous vigil in Clapham Common, south London, led to the Met being heavily criticised for its actions - although it went on to be cleared by the police watchdog.
A previously organised vigil was cancelled after organisers were told it would be illegal to stage it under lockdown conditions. 
Met officers were accused of oppressing women on Clapham Common in March last year
In February, an Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) report discovered misogyny, discrimination, bullying and sexual harassment within the ranks of the force. 
Addressing the IOPC report, the Met said in a statement it acknowledged the damage in trust their behaviour had caused. 
It added it would take ""urgent action"" to improve. 
Baroness Louise Casey is carrying out an independent review of culture and standards within the Met. It will examine the force's vetting, recruitment and training procedures.

The first ministers of Scotland and Wales want to get Ukrainians settled and cared for faster
Scotland's first minister and her Welsh counterpart have proposed that both governments become ""super sponsors"" to Ukranian refugees fleeing the war.
Nicola Sturgeon and Mark Drakeford have written to the UK government to confirm their commitment in contributing to its community sponsorship scheme.
But Scotland and Wales have offered to step further to support refugees by acting as super sponsors.
It is hoped this would allow Ukrainians to come to the two countries faster.
The idea would be to get them into temporary accommodation immediately and then work with local partners to provide longer-term places to stay, including with host individuals, and give them access to safeguarding and services. 
Households in the UK will be offered £350 a month to open their homes to people fleeing the war in Ukraine.
The UK government's Homes for Ukraine scheme calls on people to offer a spare room or an empty property to a refugee for a period of at least six months.
'No cap on refugee numbers'
In a joint letter to Levelling Up Secretary Michael Gove, Ms Sturgeon and Mr Drakeford have emphasised that the government must provide more clarity on how the scheme will work. 
The letter makes clear that no cap will be set by Scotland and Wales on the numbers of refugees they will welcome. 
Scotland has made an immediate commitment to support 3,000 refugees in the initial wave, in line with the numbers that were resettled under the Syrian scheme. Wales would take 1,000.
The Scottish government said it would welcome ""at least"" a proportionate share of the total number who come to the UK.
The letter also says it is essential that all arrivals have access to public funds, including welfare benefits, and are exempted from the Habitual Residence Test for accessing these.
The first ministers also call for urgent clarity on funding arrangements to support local government and they have suggested a ""per head"" funding arrangement similar to the Syrian and Afghanistan schemes to support resettlement and integration costs. 
Finally, the letter calls for all visa requirements for Ukrainian nationals to be waived.
'Play our full part'
Nicola Sturgeon said: ""I want Scotland to play our full part in welcoming Ukrainians seeking sanctuary from war. The UK response so far has been beset with bureaucracy and red tape, when what is needed is humanity and urgent refuge for as many as possible. 
""We are still awaiting full details of the proposed community sponsorship scheme. If the UK government is still unwilling to waive visa requirements, it is essential that this scheme works efficiently and effectively and allows people to come to the UK as quickly as possible. 
""However, I am very worried that if people have to be matched with an individual sponsor before even being allowed entry to the UK, it will prove slow and cumbersome.""
People called for more help for Ukrainian refugees at a rally in Glasgow on Saturday
She said that super sponsorship would allow large numbers to come to the respective nations quickly and that she would be able to welcome Ukrainians to Scotland as soon as possible.
However, refugee support groups fear the main problem is not with hosting Ukrainians, but in visa restrictions stopping them from entering the country in the first place.
'This is a gimmick'
Robina Qureshi, director of refugee homelessness charity Positive Action in Housing, said there were skilled and experienced hosting networks up and down the country with thousands of hosts. 
""Britain is not planning on taking its fair share of refugees, even though there is public support for taking in Ukrainian refugees,"" she said. 
""The families who host refugees don't do it for money, they are helping because they see a government that is heartless and won't lift visa restrictions. 
""The number of houses is not the problem and this is a gimmick - just another distraction from the fact that the UK is still the only country in Europe that hasn't lifted visa restrictions and there are still no safe routes here for Ukrainian war refugees.""
A spokesman for the Department for Levelling Up said: ""We are always grateful to the devolved govts for their offers of support. 
""We will continue to work with the devolved governments in the organisation of this scheme and see how best it can continue to be delivered.""

Micheál Martin and Boris Johnson sat together at the Ireland-England Six Nations match
The international co-operation shown in response to Ukraine suggests it should be possible to resolve a matter like the Northern Ireland Protocol, the taoiseach (Irish PM) has said. 
Micheál Martin was speaking a day after meeting UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson in London, during which they discussed both the Ukraine war and the protocol.
They met before attending the England-Ireland rugby match on Saturday.
Mr Martin has a series of engagements in London ahead of St Patrick's Day.
Speaking a day after his meeting with Mr Johnson, the taoiseach told the BBC's Sunday Morning programme that some progress has already been made in the post-Brexit trade dispute between the EU and the UK.
However, he said he did not believe there would be a breakthrough before the Northern Ireland Assembly election on 5 May.
Asked if the protocol talks had now been ""kicked into the long grass"" because of the crisis in Ukraine, Mr Martin said: ""I think we should concentrate, obviously, on our response to Ukraine.""
However, he added he also believed the crisis showed it should also be possible to make further progress on problems like the post-Brexit trade dispute.
""What's interesting - and I welcome this warmly - is the very strong partnership between between the UK, the EU, the US on fundamental issues of substance - which is democracy; human rights; the freedom of the individual - and that is something that I think really trumps the issues.
""It really says to us all that we should be able to resolve issues to do with the Northern Ireland Protocol.""
During Saturday's meeting, Mr Martin and Mr Johnson also discussed ways of working together to ensure the return of the Northern Ireland Executive following May's assembly election.
Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson has said it would be difficult for his party to form a government if issues around the protocol are not addressed.
A simple guide to the Brexit border problem
The mechanism to ensure free trade across the Irish border post-Brexit has been criticised by some unionists for its knock-on impact to trade between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.
In February, the DUP's Paul Givan resigned as first minister as part of the party's protest against the protocol, causing the collapse of the executive.
Taoiseach Micheal Martin wore a scarf with the colours of the Ukrainian flag as he led Sunday's St Patrick's Day parade in London
The taoiseach welcomed the ongoing engagement between the UK and the European Union on the protocol issue.
Mr Martin said access to the EU single market was important to Northern Ireland for inward investment but he added both sides were trying to find solutions. 
He argued that the EU had ""put forward a lot of sensible compromises and their mindset is to really resolve this, and I believe the foreign secretary (Liz Truss) is in the same mode of thought"".

During his trip to London, the taoiseach led the city's parade to mark St Patrick's Day on Sunday, which paid tribute to the role played by Irish people in London during the Covid-19 pandemic.
Mr Martin also wore a scarf with the colours of the Ukrainian flag during the march.

England were bidding for their first Test victory in Antigua
First Test, Sir Vivian Richards Stadium, Antigua (day five):
England 311 & 349-6 dec: Crawley 121, Root 109
West Indies 375 & 147-4: Bonner 38*, Holder 37*; Leach 3-57
Match drawn
Scorecard
England had to settle for a draw in the first Test against West Indies despite a spirited performance on the final day in Antigua. 
A bold declaration from captain Joe Root, who reached his 24th Test hundred in the morning session, gave England the chance to push for an unlikely victory.
His side took four wickets for eight runs either side of tea to boost their hopes, spinner Jack Leach claiming 3-57 on a lifeless pitch.
But West Indies, who did not attempt to chase their target of 286 in 71 overs, were steadied by a stubborn, unbroken stand of 80 between first-innings centurion Nkrumah Bonner and all-rounder Jason Holder, which lasted 35.5 overs.
Crucially England did not review an lbw appeal against Holder with 22 overs left. Had they done so he would have been dismissed by Leach.
Instead he ended 37 not out and Bonner unbeaten on 38, the players shaking hands with the score 147-4.
England's cause was hurt by the absence of fast bowler Mark Wood, who sat out the innings with an elbow injury and is now a doubt for the second Test, which begins on Wednesday in Barbados.
Earlier, despite the loss of five wickets, England added 132 to their second-innings total before declaring 20 minutes before lunch on 349-6.
Root turned his 84 not out overnight into 109, while Dan Lawrence scored 37 from 36 balls in an enterprising cameo as England sought quick runs.
The Test, the first of three in this series, may have ended in a draw but England's improved performance on the final two days offers some momentum as they look to move on from their humiliating 4-0 Ashes defeat.
TMS podcast: Defiant West Indies frustrate England
England in West Indies 2022
Pitch thwarts spirited England
England's last Test victory came against India in August
With the bowlers at their disposal, England did all that could realistically have been expected of them in their quest for victory on the final day. 
Root declared earlier than expected and slow left-armer Leach in particular bowled well, but the tourists were thwarted by a docile pitch.
After West Indies slowly reached 59-0, Ben Stokes removed Brathwaite, getting him lbw with a ball that scuttled low, but there was little mischief in the pitch thereafter.
Wood's extra pace was missed and, without it, seamers Chris Woakes and Craig Overton were ineffective.
Opener John Campbell was caught at mid-on trying to whack Leach over the top and Jermaine Blackwood was out lbw slogging across the line - two wretched strokes that helped England's cause.
However, once Bonner and Holder played themselves in, they were able to defend with relative ease, even with fielders surrounding the bat. 
England would have had a glimmer had they reviewed the lbw decision against Holder but Root, wary after earlier burning two reviews on optimistic lbw shouts, was unmoved. The technology suggested Leach's delivery would have hit leg stump.
Root held on until there were only five balls left before accepting the cause was lost.
Positives for England
England were aggressive from the outset and opener Zak Crawley, who resumed on 117, was bowled trying to strike a Holder yorker for 121.
That ended a stand of 201 between Crawley and Root, but the England captain continued to complete one of his most straightforward Test centuries.
A chanceless knock helped him overtake Alastair Cook in the list of most Test tons as England captain, and will silence any debate around his return to number three in the batting order.
Perhaps most impressive was Lawrence's brief innings which gave England impetus. Having been recalled to the side for this Test, the 24-year-old cracked the ball over the off side from the outset and hit one extravagant six.
Root's hundred was his 13th as England Test captain
This series has been billed as a new era for England after a run of one win in 14 Tests. 
Lawrence's innings, plus the performances of Leach, Crawley and first-innings centurion Jonny Bairstow are positives.
There is still much concern about Woakes' potency overseas and Overton's wicket-taking threat at this level, while Stokes, who has been nursing a side injury since the fourth Ashes Test in January, bowled 41 overs in the match. 
England must hope that does not come back to hurt them.
'I can't fault anyone today' - reaction
England captain Joe Root: ""I'm really proud of the team today and throughout the week.
""We found ourselves in a tricky position on day one, and to get ourselves back in the game through that fantastic innings from Jonny [Bairstow] was very pleasing. Throughout the game we got better and better.
""And today, chasing those last wickets, I can't fault any of the efforts of anyone.""
Player of the match Nkrumah Bonner: ""We are happy with the draw, but wanted a win.
""I think we showed real character the way we bowled this morning especially.
""We have a lot of positives to take from this game.""
BBC cricket correspondent Jonathan Agnew: ""England tried all they could to squeeze a result out. Root's declaration took a lot of people by surprise, but it was always difficult without Wood.
""Leach's three wickets will perk him up after the Ashes, the fact that three batsmen scored centuries is also a boost to a team desperate to move into more positive territory.
""There was more of a spring in the step of the fielders - and signs of the collective responsibility Root is trying to establish.""

Residents in the Ukrainian city of Melitopol have come out to protest against the alleged abduction of the mayor by Russian forces.
Ukrainian officials have posted video saying it shows Ivan Fedorov being led away, external blindfolded on Friday.
In a message, President Volodymyr Zelensky accused the Russians of ""moving to a new stage of terror"".
Melitopol, a small city in south-eastern Ukraine, was one of the first to fall to the Russians.
Russia invaded Ukraine on 24 February, arguing it felt threatened by a neighbour intent on joining Western-led organisations such as the Nato military alliance. 
In his message late on Friday, Mr Zelensky called Mr Fedorov a ""mayor who bravely defends Ukraine and the members of his community"".
""This is obviously a sign of weakness of the invaders,"" he said. 
""They have moved to a new stage of terror in which they are trying to physically eliminate representatives of legitimate local Ukrainian authorities.""

Mr Fedorov told the BBC days ago that his administration was not going to co-operate with the Russians ""in any way"".
He said that invading forces had ransacked his offices, exiling his team to another location where they are attempting to continue running their city.
There have been protests in Melitopol every day since the Russian occupation.
On Saturday, hundreds surrounded the administration building demanding the mayor's release.

Olgun Ibrahim, known as 'Ozzie' - a former worker at Clarity
The Pensions Regulator is investigating whether the owner of one of the UK's oldest social enterprises fraudulently failed to make disabled workers' pension contributions.
The 168-year-old soap maker Clarity was bought from administration in 2020. 
Workers say they lost their jobs and are still owed redundancy payments, furlough money and wages.
The owner, Nicholas Marks said he looked forward to ""clarifying the position"" with the Regulator.
Olgun ""Ozzie"" Ibrahim caught Covid a week before Christmas 2020. By the time he recovered, he was told not to come back to work. He was put on furlough in January, and received two months furlough money but nothing more - no pension payments, and no notice period or redundancy when he finally lost his job in July.
Registered blind, he had worked for 29 years at Clarity & Co, a social enterprise which had been providing employment opportunities for blind and disabled people since 1854, making toiletries under the Clarity, the Soap Co. and Beco brands.
The business, whose patrons ranged from Queen Victoria to Joanna Lumley, was losing money, and it was put into administration in January 2020.
On the same day the business and its assets were bought by a businessman, Nicholas Marks, who now stands accused of not paying workers' wages and pensions.

'Like a family'
Clarity had around 80 workers when it was sold, of whom 65 were blind, disabled, or had a health condition. 
It was more than a job, says Mr Ibrahim, it was like a family too.
Since leaving, he and his fellow workers have struggled to find work. “No-one wants to employ disabled, blind people,” he says. “Though we can do the work, no-one wants to take the chance.”
The BBC has also spoken to a number of former Clarity employees who say pension contributions were deducted from their pay packets but were never paid to the pension provider, Scottish Widows.
Among them is former team leader Allan Brooks, who worked at the company for 17 years. Registered blind, he says he didn't receive furlough money or redundancy either. 
Allan Brooks, former Clarity worker
When he heard he was losing his job, “it was a massive shock,” he says. “I was expecting to see my working days out at the company.”
He is now taking medication for depression, and hasn’t worked since he left. A number of his former colleagues are also suffering from mental health issues, Mr Ibrahim says.
Fraud investigation
The BBC has learned that The Pensions Regulator has begun an investigation into Nicholas Marks for alleged fraudulent evasion of the duty to pass on pension contributions to a workplace pension scheme, under the 1995 Pensions Act. The Pensions Regulator would not confirm or deny the investigation.
The UK Employment Tribunal website also lists judgements in favour of over 40 individuals who have won claims for unauthorised deduction of wages and other monies owed to workers by Clarity Products (the company's new name under Mr Marks's ownership).
The BBC has spoken to seven of them, who say they have not been paid the money the tribunal awarded.
Clarity Products - renamed Jublee Number 7 Ltd - is now being liquidated. Documents from the insolvency practitioners Quantuma, seen by the BBC, show the company owed more than £435,626 to 84 employees, including Mr Ibrahim and Mr Brooks.
Scottish Widows is owed £37,068 and NEST Pensions £15,494. The company's total debts amounted to more than £1.3m. 
Local MP Sir Iain Duncan Smith wrote to the minister responsible, Jesse Norman, in November 2020 to highlight the case but HMRC cannot confirm or deny whether it has begun an investigation. HMRC is owed £231,839 by Jublee Number 7, the insolvency documents show.
Nicholas Marks's response
In a statement, Mr Marks told the BBC: ""I understand that there are some technical questions being asked by the Regulator as to the supply of certain documents. Whilst I was not involved with the detail of these, much if not all of this is attributable to the pandemic which left our offices being unmanned, correspondence going astray and the departure of staff whose responsibility it was to provide this information.""
He also said he has personally lost around £500,000 and so ""any suggestion that I took money out is both absurd and patently untrue.""
He said that ""During that chaotic period [following the sale, and during the pandemic] some people weren't paid. I'm sorry that happened but some workers were TUPE'd [transferred] over from offices that no longer existed and didn't have any roles. That's not an excuse but I'm trying to explain how we inherited a complete mess.""
""For me, my biggest regret is that I couldn't save the business and the jobs but unforeseeable events conspired to make it an impossible task,"" the statement continued. 
Mr Marks did not comment on whether he would repay any of the workers who are still owed money. 
Who is Nicholas Marks?
Little is known about Nicholas Marks. Born in 1967, he describes himself as British on Companies House, though he also has links with South Africa.
In 2019, he bought a company in Lancashire called Lunar Caravans out of administration. Workers there have also complained about unpaid furlough money. 
Nicholas Marks was banned from acting as a director of a company for a year from 3 August 2020 for infringements at another company, Stafferton Waste, which has since been dissolved.
He was subject to bankruptcy orders in 2007 and 2017, according to official notices published in the London Gazette.
The gates at the former Clarity and Co factory in North London
Former Clarity worker sued 
Following reports on BBC News and elsewhere about the plight of former Clarity workers, Nicholas Marks sued two people for spreading what he claimed was false information about the company. 
They were Camilla Marcus-Dew, Clarity’s former Head of Commercial, and Cemal Ezel, a social entrepreneur who made an unsuccessful bid to buy Clarity out of administration in 2020.
The pair - who deny Mr Marks’s allegations - initially had to represent themselves without legal advice. They are now represented on a pro bono basis by two law firms, Quinn Emanuel for Ms Marcus-Dew and Hausfeld for Mr Ezel. 
Separately, on 27 January Ms Marcus-Dew was awarded £38,491 by an employment tribunal for constructive dismissal from Clarity, on top of £11,000 awarded earlier for unpaid wages (she has received nothing, she says).
Mr Ezel said that the ongoing litigation had forced him to scale back plans to expand his social enterprise, Change Please, a coffee business which provides opportunities and training for homeless people. 
Social Enterprise UK has launched a crowdfunding campaign to support former workers and campaign for policy changes to prevent similar situations occurring in the future. 
Nest Pensions, Scottish Widows and Quantuma all declined to comment.

Previous executions have triggered protests like this one in New York three years ago
Saudi Arabia says it executed 81 men on Saturday - more than during the whole of last year.
The group - including seven Yemenis and one Syrian national - were convicted of ""multiple heinous crimes"", including terrorism, state news agency SPA said.
Some were charged with belonging to the Islamic State group (IS), al-Qaeda or the Houthi rebels in Yemen.
Rights organisations say many do not receive fair trials in Saudi Arabia, an allegation the government rejects. 
According to SPA, the latest group had been tried by 13 judges and gone through a three-stage judicial process.
They were accused of plotting attacks on vital economic targets, killing or targeting members of the security forces, kidnapping, torture, rape and smuggling weapons into the country.
Saudi Arabia has one of the highest execution rates in the world - fifth in a list compiled by Amnesty International, the other four being China, Iran, Egypt and Iraq. 
It executed 69 people last year.

Mountain rescue teams and a helicopter had been searching for Neil Gillingham and his dog
Police have confirmed that a body recovered on Stob Coire Sgreamhach in Glen Coe is that of missing hillwalker Neil Gillingham.
The 43-year-old and his springer spaniel had been missing since Sunday 6 March. 
The pair were last seen at about 13:30 near Stob Coire Nam Beith, a summit on the mountain Bidean Nam Bian.
Mr Gillingham had planned to walk to both locations with his dog before descending to the Lost Valley.
Searches covered Glencoe, Lochaber and Oban and involved RAF and police mountain rescue teams and a coastguard helicopter.
On Saturday, Police Scotland confirmed the hillwalker's family had been made aware of the find and were being supported by officers.
'Difficult time'
The death is not being treated as suspicious and, as with all sudden deaths, a report will be sent to the procurator fiscal.
Sgt Keith Almond said: ""Our thoughts are with Neil's family at what is a very difficult time for them.
""Officers would like to pass on their thanks to the mountain rescue teams, HM Coastguard helicopter crews and members of the public who assisted with the searches. 
""We would also like to thank all those who shared and responded to our appeal.""
Police also confirmed that the dog was found safe and well on Monday.

Cristiano Ronaldo quadrupled his goal tally for 2022
Cristiano Ronaldo scored his first Manchester United hat-trick in 14 years as Tottenham were defeated in a thrilling encounter at Old Trafford.
The brilliant Portuguese put United ahead twice before heading home the winner from Alex Telles' corner nine minutes from time, the 807th goal of his career.
Tottenham twice responded to Ronaldo's efforts, through a Harry Kane penalty and a Harry Maguire own goal. 
But it was Ronaldo who had the final word, completing his first United treble since January 2008, in a 6-0 win over Newcastle.

MOTD analysis: How 'sensational' Cristiano Ronaldo dominated Tottenham Hotspur
The result was a major confidence boost for United before Tuesday's Champions League last-16 second leg against Atletico Madrid. 
It also moves them back into the top four and keeps Tottenham in seventh, although Arsenal - two points behind in fifth - remain favourites to clinch the final Champions League berth as they have four games in hand.
There were reports that Ronaldo is now the Fifa-recognised all-time top goalscorer, surpassing Josef Bican's 805 goals but there are doubts about the Czech-Austrian's figure - which includes reserve games.

Man Utd 3-2 Spurs: Ronaldo is never a problem - Pogba
The Ronaldo show
The debate around Ronaldo's value to this United team has been going on from the moment their season started to unravel barely a couple of weeks after his much-heralded return.
At 37, it is clear his best days are behind him.
Yet he remains capable of such moments of brilliance that it is hard to see how this present squad would benefit from him not being there.
His opener was a prime example.
Fred's deft flick to the side helped considerably but Ronaldo's two precise touches teed up the right-footed shot that flew over Hugo Lloris and into the top corner.
The second was further evidence of Ronaldo's ability to exploit weakness. He timed his run to perfection as Jadon Sancho made the most of Sergio Reguilon's struggles within the Tottenham defensive line to deliver the low cross that his vastly experienced team-mate turned home with ease.
And if anyone was likely to get a winner, it was United's number seven.
When he did, Ronaldo was immediately replaced to a standing ovation that was totally deserved.

LWLWLWL - Tottenham's consistent inconsistency
Tottenham's season was summed up by Antonio Conte's reaction to what he thought was a first-half equaliser from Ben Davies.
As the ball hit the net, there was wild celebration. Then the assistant's flag went up and Conte was stopped in his tracks.
Tottenham's past seven results have alternated between wins and defeats - with three victories punctuating four losses. And their tendency to wobble let them down again here. 
Having gone behind, they worked their way back into the game once - and there was never much doubt Kane would drive home the spot-kick after Telles had handled in the area. But the manner in which they went 2-1 down three minutes later highlighted obvious deficiencies, with Reguilon switching off on the far side of the pitch.
Tottenham then got back into the game a second time, and deserved to, even if Maguire scored for them.
But such is Spurs' inconsistency, few would believe they can genuinely overhaul Arsenal to seal a top four berth even if, mathematically, they still have a better chance of doing so than United.

Watch: Maksym Lutsyk,19 (left) and Dmytro Kisilenko, 18 are at war with three days training.
Just over a week ago I met a group of young men who had volunteered at a centre in Kyiv to fight for Ukraine. 
Most of them were in their late teens, not long out of school. They told me that after three days' basic training they would head for the front line - or very close to it. 
Maksym Lutsyk, a 19-year-old biology student, told me he wasn't fazed about trying to become a soldier after less than a week of instruction. He'd manage, after five years in the Scouts, not just learning backwoods skills, but also some weapons training. He was 10 when Ukraine's long war with separatists sponsored by Moscow started in 2014.
Maksym had gone to join up with his friend Dmytro Kisilenko, 18, who was studying economics at the same university. 
The recruits were like any bunch of young lads who had decided they were no longer boys, laughing too loudly when someone told jokes to hide their nerves, or trying a bit of bravado. 
Some of them were wearing knee pads that looked too small, as if they had come with skateboards on their 12th birthdays. A few had sleeping bags. One had a yoga mat. When they waited outside for the bus that was going to be taking them to the training base, they looked like friends on the way to a festival - apart from the guns. Each had been given custody of a Kalashnikov assault rifle.
Maksym (far left) and Dmytro (centre, with green jacket and white trainers) before their training
I'm in touch with Dmytro and Maksym and the other volunteers. This weekend I went to see them at their posts on the eastern edge of the city, where they have been issued with uniforms, body armour, proper infantry kneepads and helmets. 
A bitter wind blew through the checkpoint which the volunteers were trying to turn into a real obstacle with sandbags and steel tank traps. They made the best of their very basic training.
Dmytro told me: ""I got used to my gun. I learned how to shoot and how to act in the battle, also many other things that will be very crucial in the fight with the Russians."" He laughed, as if he found it hard to imagine what he was contemplating.
Maksym looked more urgent, more serious, less like a laid-back student.   
""I feel much more confident than I was before, because we get enough knowledge in tactics, in martial arts, in tactical medicine and in how to do something on the battlefield."" Only half joking, he wanted to see the Ukrainian flag flying from the Kremlin. 
The question on everyone's mind here is whether the battle is coming for Kyiv.
""It's definitely possible"" said Dmytro. ""We just have to stop them here, because if they get to Kyiv this war might be over.""
Barricades have been set up on roads in Kyiv using concrete blocks and ""tank traps"" from the city's museum
They are from the same town near the Russian border, which is being shelled. Their families are still there. I asked the boys what their parents thought of what they were doing. Maksym joked that his mother had told him to stay in a shelter and volunteer to cook the food. He had spared them the details of his deployment because he didn't want to worry them.
Dmytro's parents knew what he was doing. He had started by volunteering to make Molotov cocktails and after a few days rang his dad to tell him he had decided to join the territorial defence force. His father told him not to try too hard to be a hero. 
My parents, Dmytro said, are proud of what I'm doing. He looked delighted. I asked him if he felt scared of what is ahead.
""Not much, but it is human nature to feel scared, and of course deeply in my soul I feel a bit scared, as no one wants to die, even if it's for your country. So, death is not an option for us."" 
Dmytro and Maksym talked about their dreams for the future, fun with friends, finishing their studies, careers and eventually families. Their parents must be praying that their sons' plans, energy and even their lives are not smashed by the brutal realities of war, like so many in all the other generations of young men who have joined up to fight in Europe's wars.

IN DEPTH: Full coverage of the conflict
Foreign journalists have no access to the young Russian men only a few miles away on the other side of the front line. Many are believed to be conscripts, who were not told properly what was being planned for them. Wars are mostly fought by young men. 
I have no doubt that many young Russians in the war have hopes as high as Dmytro and Maksym. One difference might be less motivation to fight, though without the chance to report their side properly, it is hard to say with certainty.  
The two young Ukrainian students-turned-soldiers went back to work on the checkpoint. The professional army is a couple of miles ahead, directly facing the Russians. 
But if the Russians come, like all the volunteers, Maksym and Dmytro will be firing out of the trenches they helped dig into the surrounding ground, where boxes of Molotov cocktails are waiting - old bottles filled with petrol and pieces of grated polystyrene and stuffed with a rag to ignite what they hope might even disable a tank. 
If that doesn't work, the Nato military alliance is pouring in thousands of much more sophisticated anti-tank weapons.    
Everyone here in Kyiv is waiting for what is likely to be the key battle of the war, soldiers, civilians in and out of uniform, along with Maksym and Dmytro and the other volunteers who are getting ready to fight with them.

Watch: Yevgeny says it is his responsibility as a Russian to help Ukrainians
Outside Georgia's parliament, Yevgeny Lyamin heaves boxes of clothes and food parcels on to a waiting truck bound for Ukraine. 
He is one of more than 25,000 Russians to have arrived in Georgia since Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Russians have been struggling to find affordable accommodation in all the major cities. Many can be seen wandering around the capital, Tbilisi, with their suitcases and often even their pets.
A blue-and-yellow ribbon is attached to the lapel of Yevgeny's trench-coat - the colours of the Ukrainian flag. It was these ribbons that got him arrested at an anti-war protest in Russia, a day after it launched its war on Ukraine.
""I understood the best way to act against Putin's regime would be my emigration from Russia,"" says the 23-year old politics graduate. ""It's my responsibility to do anything I can to help the Ukrainians.""
The exodus does not stop at Georgia. The EU, US, UK and Canada have closed their airspace to Russian flights, so they are heading for countries where flights are still permitted and where visas are not required, such as Turkey, Central Asia and the South Caucasus. Many have fled to Armenia.
According to one estimate by a Russian economist, as many as 200,000 Russians have left their country since the start of the war.

Belarusians are on the move too, fleeing repression and the Western sanctions imposed on authoritarian leader Alexander Lukashenko's government for collaborating with Russia's Vladimir Putin.
That has prompted prices to surge on last-minute flights and rental accommodation in the main host cities, such as Istanbul and Armenia's capital, Yerevan.
""A one-way flight to Istanbul cost me and my husband more than our combined monthly income,"" said Anya, who did not want to give her surname. 
For her the moment of decision came with a new ""state betrayal"" law that has come into force in Russia. Anyone expressing support for Ukraine could face jail sentences of up to 20 years and Anya believed she could be a target.
""Fear of closed borders, political repression and forced military service is in our DNA. I remember my grandmother telling me stories about the state of fear they lived in during Stalin's time, and now we are experiencing it,"" she said.
An estimated 25,000 Russians have left for Georgia
Many of the new emigres are tech industry professionals who can work remotely. A video games developer I met at a cafe in Tbilisi told me that he and most people he knew disagreed with Russian policy and they knew now that any protest would be violently suppressed.
""The only way we can protest is to leave the country, take our skills and money with us. Almost everyone in our circle has made a similar decision,"" said Igor (not his real name). He plans to leave the Georgian capital, because he does not feel welcome here. 
There have been numerous reports of Airbnb hosts refusing to let their properties to Russian and Belarusian citizens.
""I do not accept Russian and Belarus people"" one host told a Belarusian couple, who shared their exchange with the BBC. ""You do not have time for vacations - revolt against your corrupt governments."" 
""They think we are running away from Russia because Apple Pay no longer works there,"" Igor complained. ""We are not running for comfort, we've lost everything there, we are basically refugees. Putin's geopolitics has destroyed our lives.""
At Tbilisi's public service hall, new arrivals are registering businesses or applying for residency.
Kristina and Nikita, who are both IT specialists from the Belarusian capital Minsk, have registered as sole entrepreneurs. That will allow them to open Georgian bank accounts.
""We don't support our governments, which is obvious because we ran away. We want to be safe here,"" said Kristina. ""But we are being bullied just because of our nationality, I need to hide my country of origin, I don't feel comfortable when people ask me where I am from.""
Since the start of the war Tbilisi has seen some of the largest rallies in support of Ukraine. A recent survey found that 87% of Georgians view the war in Ukraine as their own war with Russia.
But many Georgians are uneasy about this dramatic influx of Russians, as it is less than 14 years since Russia's leader invaded Georgia.
Some 30,000 Georgians listened to Ukraine's President Zelensky during a mass protest
Some fear President Putin might claim Russian citizens abroad need protection, because that was his excuse to justify sending troops into the breakaway Georgian region of South Ossetia in 2008. To date, 20% of Georgian territory remains under Russian occupation.
However, tech entrepreneur Lev Kalashnikov thinks Georgia will benefit from what he asserts is the biggest brain drain in Russia's modern history. He opened a group for expats on the Telegram messaging app while standing in a queue.
""There were 50 people in front of me and 50 people behind me. They became my first subscribers and now we have nearly 4,000 members.""
Members discuss where to find accommodation, how to open bank accounts, and whether or not it is safe to speak Russian in public. 
Yevgeny Lyamin is already learning Georgian, practising Georgia's unique alphabet in an exercise book.
""I am against Putin, I am against war. I still can't withdraw money from my Russian bank account, but that's nothing like the problems that Ukrainians face.""

Here are ways sanctions are affecting daily life.,"Russia sanctions: How the measures have changed daily life
The US, UK and EU have put in place unprecedented financial penalties on Russia over its invasion of Ukraine, and hundreds of international companies have pulled out of the country.
The impact of these measures is just starting to be felt, with the cost of basic products rising, a looming risk of job losses, and for some, an increasing sense of isolation.
Here are some of the ways daily life has been changing. All names have been changed, and currency conversions were correct at time of publication.
Cooking oil, sugar and blood pressure medication
Consumer prices jumped 2.2% in the first week of the invasion, with food among the biggest rises  • Some shops are restricting the sale of staples, after reports of hoarding •  Sales of medicines are not subject to sanctions, but with major shipping companies suspending services, supplies could be hit
The rouble has plummeted since Russia invaded Ukraine, leading many retailers to raise their prices. Daria, who lives in central Moscow, says she's not yet seen empty shelves. ""Food won't disappear but will get more expensive,"" she says. ""How much more expensive, I can't imagine - and am scared to even think about.""
Jan, is an EU citizen who lives and works in Moscow. ""On 20 February I ordered groceries for 5,500 roubles [about $57; £44] and now the same basket costs 8,000,"" he says. The price of milk has almost doubled in the past two weeks, he adds.
Sugar and cereal prices were already about 20% higher this February than a year ago. Russian state news agency Tass said some retailers had agreed to limit price rises on some staples to 5%. Others are restricting the amount of basics like flour, sugar and oil that customers can buy. 
Daria has been stocking up. ""We bought 4kg of coffee, 4 litres of sunflower oil, 4 litres of olive oil and four bottles of whisky."" She has also ordered a three-month supply of medication for her high blood pressure - she says some drugs are already harder to get hold of.
Last iPhones, and a last chance at 'foreign bliss'
The price of some consumer goods has drastically increased •  The cost of smartphones and televisions has increased by more than 10% and an average vacation to Turkey has increased by 29% •  Major brands like Apple, Ikea and Nike no longer sell their products in Russia
Daria had been considering buying new laptops for her family, and rushed ahead with the purchase as she saw prices steadily increase. ""At the beginning of February they cost about 70,000 roubles [$730; £560] but by the end of the month they had gone up to 100,000 roubles, which is what we paid. They then went up to 140,000 before they all sold out in Moscow.""
They didn't buy iPhone chargers, though many others did - Apple said on 2 March that it would halt all direct product sales in Russia. ""We probably should have,"" Daria says. ""There's a joke now that we all have the last iPhone.""
New cars have also gone up in price. ""We bought filters and oil for the car for when it needs a service,"" Daria says. ""We managed to buy them at the old prices before they almost doubled before our eyes."" 
Pavel, a university lecturer with a wife and two children, was looking to buy appliances for their flat in Moscow. On the day the war started, he saw some prices rise by nearly 30%. He managed to buy a fridge, cooker, washing machine and a kettle, and ordered a bed and a cupboard from Ikea just a day before it closed. He doesn't think prices in Ikea changed. ""They simply didn't have time to raise prices,"" Pavel jokes sadly.
The symbolism of McDonald's closing its 847 restaurants has not been lost on Russians - it was among the first Western firms to open in the Soviet Union 30 years ago. Within hours of the announcement, thousands of adverts appeared from Russians reselling food from its restaurants, at up to 10 times the usual price. ""Nuggets and pies bought just before the restaurant chain closed down. Your last chance to taste foreign bliss,"" said one message. 
But Vladimir, who lives in Saratov in south western Russia, says he has yet to feel the impact of Western sanctions. ""Vatniki [Kremlin supporters] won't be affected by the fall in the rouble, because they don't buy expensive foreign goods.""
Losing customers and maybe online services
Russian banks removed from Swift international payment system • Visa, Mastercard, American Express, Apple and Google Pay limit their services in Russia • Russian central bank says economy could shrink by up to 8%
""The situation has had a big impact on our business,"" says Natasha, who works in the fitness industry. ""Our customer numbers are down. People are asking us to refund their club membership. And our costs for rent, equipment and cleaning are all rising. Outgoings have gone up by 30% on average since sanctions were introduced."" She anticipates that many businesses like hers will close. Those that don't will struggle to find Russian manufacturers to replace imported equipment. 
Ekaterina runs a number of language schools and says the sanctions have already caused her problems. ""We have teachers in other countries we can't pay because all the transfer networks are frozen. We also have students in the US, Germany and Latvia who can't pay their fees into our accounts. We've found ways around it but at the moment every working day begins with fire-fighting a new crisis."" 
Ekaterina is worried how they will manage their international group lessons if Zoom is blocked, and says she has had problems because her online platforms were maintained by a company in Ukraine.
""Everything stopped immediately although we worked with them for ages. We were very happy with them and their work was top class. We are very upset for them, for ourselves, that we're all in this situation,"" she says.
Natasha is finding it hard to come to terms with the changes. ""This is a completely new kind of crisis which makes us all feel lost and bewildered. Not just in business but in our own lives. The loss of income, having to give up a whole way of life, reduced connections, including on social media, and not being able to travel to see family and friends who live abroad. There are a lot of things we have already lost and haven't yet fully understood.""
Daria says hearing about job losses as big international companies pull out of Russia worries her. ""So far there aren't any cuts in the government-funded projects I work on,"" she says, ""but I'm very scared of losing my job.""
Media closures and Cold War memories
New law threatens to jail anyone deemed to have spread ""fake"" news on the invasion • Independent and international media subject of severe restrictions • More than 13,000 people arrested, external in anti-war protests 
Daria holds President Putin responsible for the sanctions, but most Russians get their news from state-run media, which carries the Kremlin's anti-Ukraine propaganda. Many people support him and may end up blaming the West for sanctions.
Others don't approve of the war, but stay silent - it's risky for Russians to criticise their leader. Western governments hope the sanctions being piled on Russians will hurt enough to bring change at the top, but that could take time.

The view that only better-off Russians will feel the pain of sanctions is debatable. No-one is sure quite what's going to happen next, but the economic fallout is expected to be severe and long lasting.  Russia's central bank said there had been a ""drastic"" economic change since the invasion.
On the surface you might not guess what's going on in Moscow, says Daria. The city's cafes and restaurants are full, the metro is working, the traffic jams in the centre haven't gone anywhere. ""That's if you don't see the protests, the searches and the departures of creative people who make a big noise about leaving. A lot of other people are probably quietly leaving too. This gives me the feeling that we're running out of air,"" she says. 
Today's events bring back memories of the 1990s, when Russia's economy collapsed after the Soviet Union fell apart. ""It's been interesting talking to people in their 30s about those times and the ration cards we had for food. We had coupons and tokens to buy sugar, butter and vodka,"" says Daria. 
""I remember the huge queues to buy sausage... There were often loud arguments, against selling things to the out-of-town shoppers. It was shameful. I hope it doesn't come to that again. 
""I'm afraid that there will be more burglaries and robberies because of a sudden increase in poverty and job losses,"" she says. 
Jan says he hasn't noticed life changing in a big way and he doesn't plan to leave. ""My family and my work are here. It's very hard to start life all over again in a new place.""

353,353,Ukraine maps: At-a-glance guide to the Russia war,"Sat, 12 Mar 2022 17:28:30 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-60506682,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-60506682?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,Russian troops have expanded their offensive as they continue attempts to cut off the capital Kyiv.,"Ukraine in maps: Tracking the war with Russia
Fighting has raged in Ukraine since Russia launched a full-scale invasion in February 2022. Russian forces have made small gains in recent months but now Ukrainian forces have staged a counter-offensive into Russia.
Here is a recap of recent significant events and the situation in Ukraine. 
Ukraine sends units into Russia
Ukrainian troops launched a surprise attack across the border in early August, advancing up to 18 miles (30km) into the Russian region of Kursk.
Almost 200,000 people were evacuated from areas along the border by the Russian government and President Vladimir Putin condemned the Ukrainian offensive as a ""major provocation"".
After two weeks, Ukraine's top commander claimed to control more than 1,200 sq km of Russian territory and 93 villages. The regions of Kursk and Belgorod have both declared a state of emergency.
The counter-offensive is seen partly as an attempt to force Russia to redeploy units from the east and relieve pressure on the beleaguered Ukrainian defences there, and partly as a bid to improve Ukraine's chances of a peace settlement.
Russian incursion north of Kharkiv
At the beginning of May 2024, Russian forces crossed the international border to the north of Ukraine's second-biggest city, Kharkiv. Several villages were seized and thousands of civilians fled.
Russia's main offensive has long focused on the eastern Donetsk region, but this was one of the most significant ground assaults since the start of the war and further stretched Ukraine's front-line defences.
The Russian push took place at the end of a four-month period when the US was not supplying weapons to Ukraine, due to a stalemate in the US Congress.  
The issue was finally resolved at the end of April, when the US passed a $61bn aid package to provide missiles, artillery and air-defence systems to the Ukrainian military.
Ukrainian forces eventually held firm and even though the city of Kharkiv has come under repeated attack from glide bombs fired by Russian warplanes, it remains beyond the range of Russian artillery.
Russia grinds forward in the east
The incursion north of Kharkiv was some distance from the main front line in the east where Russia has continued its offensive operations and been edging forwards since October 2023.
Eastern Ukraine has been contested territory since 2014, when Russian-backed fighters seized large swathes of the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions. 
Russia's biggest advantage is manpower and it has shown a willingness to throw soldiers at Ukrainian positions to gain a few metres at a time. 
About 1,200 Russian soldiers were being killed or wounded every day in May and June, the highest rate since the beginning of the war, according to Western officials.
In recent days, Russian troops have made some significant gains to the north-west of Donetsk and claim to have captured the small town of Niu-York.
In response, Ukraine has ordered the evacuation of the city of Pokrovsk, with a local military official telling residents that Russian forces were ""rapidly approaching"". 
The Russian advance towards Pokrovsk is the most notable change in control of the front line near Donetsk for several months. 
The last major change came when Ukraine withdrew its troops from Avdiivka, just north of Donetsk, back in February after months of fighting. 
Almost all of Avdiivka's pre-war population of more than 30,000 people have left and the town itself is almost completely destroyed.
To the north, areas around Bakhmut have remained a flashpoint and have endured some of the heaviest fighting of the war. 
Although Ukraine gained some ground around Chasiv Yar, which is situated on high ground some 10km west of Bakhmut, Russian forces have since made further advances in the area. 
Two and a half years of fighting
Russia's invasion began with dozens of missile strikes on cities all over Ukraine before dawn on 24 February 2022.
Russian ground troops moved in quickly and within a few weeks were in control of large areas of Ukraine and had advanced to the suburbs of Kyiv.
Russian forces were bombarding Kharkiv, and they had taken territory in the east and south as far as Kherson, and surrounded the port city of Mariupol.
But they hit very strong Ukrainian resistance almost everywhere and faced serious logistical problems with poorly motivated Russian troops suffering shortages of food, water and ammunition.
Ukrainian forces were also quick to deploy Western supplied arms such as the Nlaw anti-tank system, which proved highly effective against the Russian advance.
By October 2022, the picture had changed dramatically and having failed to take Kyiv, Russia withdrew completely from the north. The following month, Ukrainian forces recaptured the southern city of Kherson.
Since then, the battle has mostly been in the east of Ukraine with Russian forces slowly gaining ground over many months, while losing at least 50,000 troops - and probably many more.

An estimated 25,000 of them have moved to Georgia. Yevgeny is one of them.

355,355,The Papers: £350 a month refugee plan and plea to help orphans,"Sun, 13 Mar 2022 01:27:22 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-the-papers-60724726,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-the-papers-60724726?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,The new scheme that will allow people in the UK to host Ukrainian refugees dominates the front pages.,"Newspaper headlines: UK refugee scheme and plea to help orphans
The announcement of a new scheme that will allow people in the UK to house Ukrainian refugees dominates the front pages. Households will be paid £350 per month to host refugees, in a move the Sunday Telegraph says is “unprecedented”. Members of the public will be able to fill out an “expression of interest” form from tomorrow, the paper reports.
The Sunday Express also leads on the scheme to support Ukrainian refugees. The paper reports that Communities Secretary Michael Gove will unveil the plan he says will provide ""a safe haven for thousands of families enduring their darkest hours”. It also reports the latest remarks by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky who said ""Putin must raze"" the capital Kyiv to seize it, and Russian officials, who said Western arms convoys are ""legitimate targets"".
The Homes for Ukraine scheme also features on the front page of the Mail on Sunday along with the announcement of further plans. The paper claims the mansions of Russian oligarchs would be seized and used to house Ukrainians fleeing the war. It says this would be part of “an extraordinary plan” being championed by Mr Gove. But it is currently being blocked by senior officials in the Treasury and Foreign Office, according to the paper.
The plea to people to open their doors to Ukrainian refugees also makes the front of the Sunday People. This time it comes from Charlie Rowley, a survivor of the Salisbury Novichok attack suspected to have been carried out by Russian operatives. The paper reports that Mr Rowley, whose partner died in the attack in Wiltshire, is urging people to welcome those fleeing the war. He has told the paper “we can’t turn a blind eye to desperate people”.
The Sunday Mirror is calling for “vital supplies and “a safe passage” for dozens of orphaned babies and toddlers its says are currently hiding in a basement as shelling across Ukraine continues. The paper calls it the “heart-breaking reality of Putin’s war”. It says the Kyiv children are among 100,000 orphans who lived in 700 homes across Ukraine when the conflict started. It features a picture on its front page that it says shows dozens of toddlers hiding from the bombing.
The Sunday Times reports that an entire city in eastern Ukraine has been wiped out in the Russian invasion, citing a Ukrainian regional governor. Correspondent Richard Spencer writes that Russian-backed separatists claimed to have captured Volnovakha after heavy bombardment demolished much of the city of 21,000 people. The UK plan for refugees also features on the paper’s front page.
And the Daily Star reports that one of its readers told the police he had seen a UFO . He also told the newspaper that after he reported the sighting to the force, he was then visited by two “government officials”.
Most of the papers focus on the UK's plans to house Ukrainians who have fled the war, or what the Sunday Express, external calls the ""£350-a-month thank you for giving refuge"".
A man who survived the Novichok attack in Salisbury urges volunteers to sign up, external in the Sunday People.
A government source tells the Sunday Telegraph that the payments to hosts will prove much cheaper than using hotels, external; in its editorial, the paper welcomes what it calls the government's ""open-door"" offer, external to Ukrainian refugees as ""generous and courageous"". 
But in the Observer, the Refugee Council questions whether families will be supported, external as they care for highly traumatised migrants. 
The Sunday Times leads on a claim by the governor of the Donetsk region that President Putin has wiped out the city of Volnovakha, external, saying all its infrastructure has gone. 
People in the western Ukrainian city of Lviv, which had been considered a safe haven, tell the Observer about their fears that the Russian troops are getting closer and closer, external.
Writing in the Sunday Telegraph, Attorney General Suella Braverman warns that not just Russian leaders but ordinary Russian soldiers could face jail for war crimes, external committed in Ukraine. 
She says they could be tried in the ""courtrooms of Kyiv, The Hague or even in the UK"".
According to the Sun on Sunday, MPs have called on Boris Johnson to nominate Volodymyr Zelensky for an honorary knighthood, external. There's said to be cross-party support to honour the Ukrainian president. 
The Sunday Times suggests he needs to decide whether to leave Kyiv, external and risk being labelled a coward, or stay, creating a threat to his life and to Ukraine's presidential succession. Allies insist he won't move.
An investigation by the Sunday Times examines the peer, Evgeny Lebedev, external, and his past pronouncements on President Putin's actions, which it suggests makes for ""uncomfortable reading"".
The paper says he questioned whether the former Russian spy, Alexander Litvinenko, was murdered by MI6 rather than by the Russian security services and also defended the invasion of Crimea. 
Lord Lebedev, who holds both British and Russian citizenship, has insisted he's opposed to the Ukrainian war and is not a Russian agent.

There's more concern for the Queen's health, with the Sun suggesting that she's too frail to walk her dogs, external. It says the monarch hasn't taken her pets out since October. 
And several papers speculate on the contents of the chancellor's spring budget. 
The Sun says Rishi Sunak has ruled out any ""big bazooka"" action to combat the cost of living crisis, external. 
The Sunday Telegraph suggests options he may consider include reducing the rate at which Universal Credit payments are cut for people who work and a higher-than-planned increase in state benefits, external. 
The Observer suggests there are calls from across the political spectrum for higher benefits and pensions; while the Sunday Times says MPs want him to slash fuel duty. 
In its editorial the Sunday Times calls on Mr Sunak to ""grasp the nettle"" and at least delay the planned rise in National Insurance, external.

Peter Myers: “Multi-coloured houses on a crowded hillside in Lima, Peru.”
Hesham Ellabban: “A megalopolis never seizes to amaze with its infinite layers and contradictions and always being on the edge of implosion. A city that you love to hate and hate to love - Cairo.”

In 1975 hundreds of sex workers took refuge in churches across France to protest against police harassment, in their first ever collective action. 
Police had begun systematically issuing fines in a crackdown on the women who found customers on the streets. Those who couldn't pay were often imprisoned for days at a time and separated from their children. 
The strike began at Saint Nizier church in Lyon but spread to other cities, including Paris. 
Pere Christian Delorme stayed with and helped the women at Saint Nizier church.

358,358,Ukraine war: Pictures of war intensifying in third week,"Sat, 12 Mar 2022 12:15:39 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-60720169,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-60720169?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,Images from Russia's invasion of Ukraine show a conflict turning deadlier nearly three weeks on.,"Ukraine war: Pictures of war intensifying in third week
It's already week three of the Russian invasion - and the scenes below are becoming all too familiar across Ukraine.
Cities across the country often wake up to the haunting call of air raid sirens and skies filled with traces of rockets, missiles and artillery strikes, like this one from Baryshivka, east of the capital, Kyiv.  
Russia may have been slow to advance inside Ukrainian territory, but the shelling has been intense. 
The Russians say they are hitting military targets - the scene below is from a storage facility in Kalynivka, in the centre of the country. 
Ukrainians, however, say the occupying force has been aiming for civilian targets indiscriminately. 
One of the worst-hit cities has been Kharkiv in the east. 
The BBC's Quentin Sommerville says entering the centre of the city is almost like entering another world. Few neighbourhoods have escaped some kind of damage. 
The relentless Russian shelling has meant that most of the 1.5 million population has fled. 
Early in the mornings, queues can still be seen at pharmacies, banks, supermarkets and petrol stations, as those who stayed behind stock up on supplies, our correspondent says. 
A huge logistical and humanitarian effort is going on behind the scenes to keep Kharkiv running - these volunteers below are preparing food for the defenders, and others who may need it.
And the toll is mounting by the day. Even though official figures are patchy, thousands are believed to have lost their lives or sustained serious injuries, many losing limbs in the shelling.
The situation is said to be dire in the port city of Mariupol, which has been surrounded by Russian troops for nearly two weeks.
Authorities say nearly 1,600 have died as a result of Russian shelling alone - and they are unable to collect the bodies amid unrelenting Russian firepower to force it to surrender.  
Not far from Mariupol, another battle is being waged to conquer the city of Mykolaiv. Cluster bombs have been used, but the locals are resisting.
However, Mykolaiv's governor Vitaly Kim is loath to celebrate prematurely, telling the BBC's Andrew Harding, ""We are winning this fight, but not this war.""
Dnipro was hit for the first time on Friday - a day when Russia expanded its strikes from east, where the city lies, to the west.
The capital city is bracing for the worst. Ukrainian forces have been holding the Russians back for days on the outskirts.
And in Kyiv city itself, volunteers have been preparing - digging trenches and building barricades. The city is turning into a fortress, says our correspondent there Jeremy Bowen.
Others are trying to contribute to the effort. Field kitchens have sprung up in various neighbourhoods.
However, for many Ukrainians - women and children only, as men have to stay behind to fight - the scramble to flee has become the norm. More than 2.5 million people have now left the country.
The shock is all too real. Here in Moldova, Smadar the Clown tries to lighten the mood with this mock interview with a young Ukrainian girl at a refugee centre in the country's capital, Chisinau.

Culture is randomly a victim of the war, too, as seen in too many conflicts this century alone. The picturesque western city of Lviv has been left untouched, so far. 
But it is preparing - the checkpoints on main roads and the soldiers on the streets can be seen by all - but some preparations are taking place behind closed doors, says the BBC's Joel Gunter.
In Lviv's galleries, museums and churches, a huge operation is under way to safeguard the city's cultural heritage, he says.

BBC Click's Omar Mehtab spoke to a 'scalper,' an unfavourable term for a person who buys and stockpiles popular products - making it harder for consumers to find the goods they want to buy, let alone buy them at the intended market price. 
Speaking in front of a wall of stacked PlayStation gaming consoles he bought to resell at a higher price, the former investment banker turned goods reseller said he was utilising a gap in the supply chain.

360,360,Will Russia's attack on Ukraine help thaw US-Venezuela relations?,"Sun, 13 Mar 2022 00:23:15 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-60697017,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-60697017?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,"The ban on Russian oil exports is causing prices to surge, and leaders are revisiting some awkward friendships.","Will Russia's attack on Ukraine help thaw US-Venezuela relations?
Venezuela has large oil reserves, but any increase in production would require a great deal of investment
The US and Venezuela have not seen eye-to-eye for several years now.
This past week, however, has displayed signs that the relationship might be blossoming - or at least that seeds of co-operation are being planted, after the first high-level talks between US and Venezuelan officials in years.
It's a new direction for the two countries. Washington has in recent years slapped sanctions on Venezuela's oil sector over President Nicolás Maduro's poor democratic and human rights record. Mr Maduro himself has a $15m (£11m) bounty on his head after being indicted in the US on charges including narco-terrorism, drug-trafficking, and corruption.
President Maduro, in return, accuses the US of colonialism and bullying, and of trying to get involved - unreasonably - in Venezuela's internal affairs.
Mutual benefits
It's not a comfortable rapprochement. These are desperate times, and desperate measures are needed. Oil helps make the world go round and Venezuela has a lot of it - and when the world is in crisis, such as with the ban on Russian oil exports causing prices to surge, leaders start revisiting those awkward friendships.
""In Venezuela, it's all about the oil,"" says political historian Prof Margarita López Maya. ""One of the first steps the US did in the Second World War was bring in a good ambassador [to Venezuela] to give support to the government - to secure that oil.""
There's no doubt that a better relationship would benefit Venezuela, too. Mr Maduro wants to see sanctions lifted, and last week the president - a man normally so willing to criticise the US - offered an olive branch on state TV.
Flying the flags of friendship
""The two flags of the US and Venezuela were there, they looked really pretty, the two of them, united as they should be,"" said President Maduro of the meeting in the Venezuelan capital, Caracas, last weekend. ""A new opportunity has been opened. We had a respectful, cordial and very diplomatic meeting. It's time for diplomacy, truth and peace.""
Indeed, Mr Maduro also said he was ready to return to talks with the Venezuela opposition, hosted in Mexico. And a few days after the US-Caracas meeting, Venezuela released two jailed US citizens.
So far, so positive - but where will this thawing of relations lead?
""In the US, for a while now, internal forces have been saying that the strategy of oil sanctions didn't make much sense after all this time and its objective wasn't working,"" says Luis Vicente Leon, director of Caracas-based consulting firm Datanalisis. ""When the conflict with Ukraine started, it became clear that a policy of oil sanctions put it in a predicament.""
Doubts overshadow hope on Caracas streets
Many see these talks as a marriage of convenience. But it's early days and still a tumultuous relationship.
""Both sides are hypocritical, I don't believe anyone,"" says Maria Eugenia Farina, a shop owner in Caracas. It's a feeling echoed by so many in Venezuela who have given up on politicians of any stripe being able to pull the country out of its crisis. 
Others, though, are more willing to give these talks a chance.
""Do I see it as a positive? Yes, because Venezuela would go bankrupt, someone has to give,"" says Caracas resident Ana Pérez. ""We are weak. If they lift sanctions, things can get better here.""
Venezuela crisis in 300 words
But anyone expecting a quick turnaround may be disappointed.
""They've had one trip and just a couple of meetings, so you couldn't anticipate that the tectonic plates would have shifted just yet,"" says Eric Farnsworth, vice-president of the Council of the Americas and a former State Department official.
""When you begin to realise how fundamentally difficult it is going to be to make a meaningful difference, then you begin to have second thoughts as to whether it's truly worth the effort to do that,"" he adds.
Venezuela once had the capacity to produce around three million barrels of oil a day. It's now under a million. Any increase in production would require a great deal of investment - and that would also require an easing of sanctions. The Middle East, say experts, is the only solution in the short-term.
Maduro's Russia conundrum
""Venezuela is currently exporting through China and Maduro is getting tons of money compared to the past two years,"" says Francisco Monaldi, the director of the Latin American Energy Programme at Rice University's Baker Institute in Houston. ""Having said that, the disruption of the markets that's happening will make Russians send tons of oil to China at a heavy discount, and that will disturb Maduro's business.""
President Nicolás Maduro, seen here addressing the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva after Russian troops invaded Ukraine
Therein lies the other big issue - the relationship between Russia and Venezuela.
""Violence is the expression of the capitalist world,"" Venezuela's Vice-President Delcy Rodríguez said last week. ""Nato countries provoking a power like Russia. What are they looking for? The annihilation of the entire world? Venezuela raises its voice for peace. You will never see us in the war ranks.""
So, could the US visit be more than just oil? An attempt to change Venezuela's political allegiances, perhaps?
""I just don't see how Maduro would perceive it to be in his interests to turn his back on the Russians in favour of a US administration which has him under indictment by the US Department of Justice,"" says Mr Farnsworth. ""What I do think will happen - and has maybe begun to happen - is that Venezuelans will just tone down the rhetoric a little bit.""
From foes to frenemies? It's a plausible - and welcome - possibility. But not everyone is convinced.

Vishnu, pictured with his dog Leo, was studying medicine at university in Ukraine before Russia invaded
Smiling down the camera from his parents' home in southern India, with his dog Leo on his lap, it's hard to believe that only a few days have passed since Vishnu thought he was going to die as he sheltered from Russian shelling in the Ukrainian city of Vinnytsia.
Even though Vinnytsia is in western Ukraine, a long way from the Russian border, it has still faced attacks. Last week nine people died in a missile strike that destroyed the airport on the outskirts of the city, officials say.
Polla Vishnu Vardhan Rao, 21, is one of the tens of thousands of Indian students in Ukraine to have escaped the country since Russia invaded. 
He says the kindness of Ukrainians is the main reason he is still alive.
Two weeks ago Vishnu had been enjoying life as a fourth-year medical student. 
His days were spent attending classes at the university and in the city's hospitals, studying in the library, and swimming in the river with Leo.
""Ukraine is the most beautiful, peaceful country. In Vinnytsia there are so many peaceful places,"" Vishnu says.
But on 24 February, the day Russia's invasion began, he woke up to ""blasting sounds, firing sounds"".
He and his two flatmates, also Indian students, had no idea what was happening. 
""We were very panicked,"" he says.
""I see outside the window some Ukrainians running with bags - I don't know where they are going.""

He'd never heard the sound of air-raid sirens and didn't understand the accompanying announcements blared out in Ukrainian.
Luckily, Vishnu's Ukrainian neighbours could translate the warnings into English and explain that war had broken out. 
""They [said] some planes and tanks came and are fighting Ukraine - so don't go out, please stay inside,"" he says.
Over the course of the next two days, Vinnytsia's sirens sounded every few hours, forcing Vishnu and his friends into the dark bunker beneath their apartment, which was full of rubble.
He couldn't sleep, so spent hours on the phone, trying to work out a plan to escape the city.
""I thought: 'Maybe I will die in this situation,'"" he says.
This was the scene after a missile hit a building at the airport on the outskirts of Vinnytsia
One of Vishnu's friends managed to find a Ukrainian minibus driver willing to take them to the Romanian border 250km (155 miles) away. 
The driver, whose normal job involved taking people on day trips out of Vinnytsia, was not yet ready to leave the country himself because his wife was ill. So he agreed to make the risky trip, for which the group paid him a total of 12,000 Ukrainian hryvnia (£300). 
Vishnu says he owes this driver his life. 
""I can't express - it's because of him, only, we got saved. I say to him thank you, from the bottom of my heart.""

Watch: Indian students on the trauma of escaping Ukraine's war
Vishnu was worried pets might not be allowed on the border, so he left Leo with his Ukrainian teacher and boarded the minibus.
As the bus rolled through the roads of south-west Ukraine, Vishnu and his friends started to relax. There was one moment of tension when planes whizzed overhead - Ukrainian or Russian, Vishnu doesn't know - but for the most part they felt like they were moving to safety.
But the worst part of Vishnu's journey was yet to come.
Vishnu was among 20 Indian students taken to the Romanian border by a minibus driver from Vinnytsia
When the bus driver dropped Vishnu and his friends off, they joined a throng of hundreds of people trying to pass through a gate at the border. 
Vishnu says only Ukrainians were being allowed through - and each time he got close to the crossing, guards would ""drag"" him to the back again.

After a whole day standing in an ever-growing crowd, Vishnu began to worry that he would never get through the border. 
Pop-up cafes serving refugees had run out of food and drink, and Vishnu had finished the bananas and buns he'd brought with him as snacks. 
Vishnu says the worst part of his journey was waiting to cross the border into Romania
Eventually he resorted to pleading with the guards to let him and his friends through.
""We [were] asking: 'Please let us pass, we [have been] standing for two days, we are getting pains, we don't have food, water.
""Finally, they accepted.""
So Vishnu passed through the border with a few of his friends - but 13 of his original group of 20 were left behind.
The Indian embassy in Romania helped Vishnu (left) fly home after 30 hours on the border
Speaking of how he felt in that moment, Vishnu said: ""Personally, I'm happy. But so many friends aren't. I'm selfish, at this point. We have to be selfish because it's our own life. We can't risk our life for our friends - so we moved on.""
Everyone in Vishnu's group of 20 has since made it home to India. 
But he remains worried about other friends in Kyiv - also Indian students - who are stuck in their bunkers as Russian forces continue to bombard the capital city with attacks.
Vishnu is now safe at his parents' home in southern India, but hopes one day to return to Ukraine
With the help of the Indian embassy in Romania, Vishnu was taken by bus from the border to Bucharest airport. His worried mum and dad smothered him with hugs and kisses when he landed at Rajiv Gandhi Airport in Hyderabad.
A few days after he arrived to parents' house in Suryapet, Telangana, Vishnu was also reunited with his beloved Leo.
His teacher in Ukraine had fled with her family to Moldova but took Leo on the bus all the way to Bucharest, from where the dog was flown to India.
Vishnu says he and Leo couldn't have got home without the kindness of the people of Vinnytsia.
""I'm lucky, so many guys helped me - my neighbours, the bus driver, my teacher.
""Ukrainian people are very good people.""

362,362,Xenotransplantation: Are pigs the future of organ transplants?,"Sun, 13 Mar 2022 00:34:47 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-60708120,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-60708120?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,"After a series of medical breakthroughs, will these animals solve the global shortage of organs?","Xenotransplantation: Are pigs the future of organ transplants?
The frontiers of organ transplantation have been pushed further than ever before. The first organs taken from genetically engineered pigs have been put into people and the recipient of the first pig heart managed to survive for two months. 
So how close are we to using pigs for a limitless supply of organs to solve the global shortage? 
Silence descends on the operating theatre and the tension builds until it's almost a physical presence in the room.
Surgeons have just connected a pig's kidney to a human body. The clamps have been released and human blood is now flowing into the pig organ. 
""You could have heard a pin drop,"" says transplant surgeon Dr Jayme Locke.
Success or failure will be determined in moments and there is now just a single question on everyone's minds: ""Pink or black?""
If the body unleashes a horrendous assault on the foreign organ - holes will be ripped in every cell in the pig tissue and the organ will clot from the inside out. It will go splotchy, then blue, then completely black within minutes.
If ""hyperacute rejection"" is avoided, the organ will blush pink with the flow of blood and oxygen. 
""It turned beautiful and pink... the sense of relief, the sense of joy and hope just filled the room. We might have high-fived as well,"" said Dr Locke, from the University of Alabama at Birmingham, in the US.
This operation was just one of a series of medical breakthroughs that have renewed interest in the field of xenotransplantation.
The surgical team at the University of Alabama at Birmingham.
Using animal organs in the human body is an old idea,, external and has ranged from ""zest for life"" chimpanzee testicle implants to replacement kidneys and hearts taken from our primate relatives. The latter often ended in death soon afterwards. The problem is, our immune system treats the transplanted organ like an infection and attacks. 
The focus these days is on pigs, as their organs are roughly the right size and we have centuries of experience farming them.
But the challenge of hyperacute rejection - keeping organs pink, not black - is the same. You can't just pop down to the farm, choose a pig and transplant its organs. It's taken huge advances in genetic engineering to alter pigs' DNA so their organs are more compatible with our immune systems. 
Inside Health is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Tuesdays at 2100 GMT - and Wednesdays at 1530 GMT. It is also available as a podcast on BBC Sounds.
Listen to Pig organs for transplant patients
The recent kidney and heart transplants have taken organs from the specially designed ""10-gene pig"".
It has one genetic tweak to prevent any donated organs responding to human growth hormones and growing out of control. 
Another key alteration removes a sugary molecule, called alpha-Gal, which sticks to the surface of pig cells and acts like a gigantic flashing neon sign marking the tissue as absolutely alien. 
A wing of our immune system, called the complement system, is constantly patrolling the body looking for alpha-Gal. That's why organs can be rejected and killed moments after they are transplanted. 
Two other ""neon signs"" were genetically removed and six human ones added in, acting like a camouflage net over the pig cells to help hide them from the immune system. 
The resulting 10-gene pigs are then raised in sterile conditions so they are suitable for transplant. 
The kidney and the heart
The pair of pig kidneys were transplanted into the brain-dead body of Jim Parsons in September 2021. 
He'd wanted to be an organ donor when he died and when his kidneys were donated, pig kidneys were put in their place with permission from his family.
Dr Locke describes the moment one of the kidneys started making urine as ""remarkable"" and feels xenotransplantation can ""really change people's lives, and to be blunt, save their lives"". She's expecting to start clinical trials later this year. 
The family of Jim Parsons gave permission for pigs' kidneys to be transplanted into his body
That operation was a three-day-long experiment, but meanwhile, surgeons at the University of Maryland Medical Center were about to go one step further. 
Their patient, David Bennett, 57, had severe heart failure. He was not deemed suitable for a human heart transplant and was being kept alive by an Ecmo machine, which supported his heart and lungs.
Mr Bennett described having a pig heart as a ""shot in the dark"".
A 10-gene pig was driven to the hospital and on 7 January, its heart was placed inside David Bennett's chest. The operation was tricky because Mr Bennett's diseased heart had swollen, so connecting the blood vessels to the smaller pig-heart was a challenge.
Again there was the nervous moment to see whether the heart would be rapidly rejected, but it was beating and stayed pink. Dr Muhammad Mohiuddin, the hospital's director of cardiac xenotransplantation, said he did not expect to witness this ""in my lifetime"".
When I spoke to him on the one-month anniversary of the operation he said there were no signs of the organ being rejected, but Mr Bennett was still frail.
""We put a new Ferrari engine in a 1960s car. The engine is working great but the rest of the body has to adjust,"" he said.
The first pig-to-human-heart transplant was carried out in Baltimore
But Mr Bennett died two months after the transplant. The cause, and therefore the implications for xenotransplantation, is still uncertain.
Mr Bennett was very frail before the operation and it is possible that even the new heart was not enough. 
No signs of organ rejection have been reported, but if detailed analysis of the heart shows signs of the immune system attacking it, the 10-gene pig may need further modifications to make its organs suitable for the human body. 
Alternatively, it could come down to anatomy, and pig hearts may not be up to the job in a human body. Our hearts have to work much harder to fight gravity than a pig's because we walk on two legs rather than four. 
Chris Denning, a professor of stem cell biology at the University of Nottingham, said overcoming hyperacute rejection meant the heart transplant would be considered ""a success"". He said if the issue was frailty, then xenotransplantation ""could be successful in the future"" but if it came down to anatomy then it could ""be potentially a show-stopper"".
The hospital plans to continue doing clinical trials. 
Surgeon Bartley P Griffith pictured with David Bennett in January
Pig hearts do not have to be as good as a human heart to still save huge numbers of lives, according to Prof John Wallwork, one of the UK's most eminent transplant surgeons. Many people die waiting for a transplant.
Prof Wallwork, who conducted the world's first heart-lung-liver transplant and was an early pioneer of xenotransplantation, says it's better to give 1,000 people a 70% chance of survival with a pig heart than 100 people an 85% chance with a human heart. 
""So if it's not quite as good as human transplantation, then we've still done more good than not doing the 1,000 patients,"" he said.
Xenotransplantation has always felt like the next big thing in transplant medicine. There's no doubt a series of landmark operations have been performed, but only more research will tell us whether the field - and its grand dreams - will ever come of age. 
Dr Locke added: ""Our goal would be to have one 10-gene edited pig be able to save a patient with kidney failure, a patient with liver failure, a patient with heart failure and a patient with end-stage lung disease.
""That would be a remarkable accomplishment and I genuinely believe that we will be there during my lifetime.""

363,363,Bafta Awards 2022: Stars prepare to return to in-person ceremony,"Sun, 13 Mar 2022 00:54:17 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-60675263,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-60675263?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,Australian star Rebel Wilson will host the full-capacity ceremony at London's Royal Albert Hall.,"Bafta Film Awards: Jane Campion's The Power of the Dog wins top prize
Campion didn't attend the Baftas as she was at the Directors Guild Awards and the Critics Choice Awards in Los Angeles over the weekend
Netflix's moody Western The Power of the Dog won the top prize at the Bafta Film Awards, picking up best film and best director for Jane Campion.
Its star Benedict Cumberbatch wore a badge to show his support for Ukrainians as he accepted the best director prize on behalf of Campion.
He also said he hopes to offer a place to stay for a Ukrainian refugee.
Cumberbatch was beaten to the best actor award by Will Smith. Joanna Scanlan was named best actress.
Benedict Cumberbatch, pictured with wife Sophie Hunter, wore a blue and yellow badge
Scanlan, who was previously best known for British TV comedies like The Thick Of It and Getting On, triumphed for her performance in the independent film After Love. She played a 60-year-old Muslim convert who suffers an identity crisis following the sudden death of her husband.
""Come on!"" she said on stage in disbelief. ""Some stories have surprise endings don't they?""
She beat a field including Lady Gaga, fellow musician-turned-actress Alana Haim, and Emilia Jones, the daughter of Welsh TV presenter Aled.
Joanna Scanlan said backstage that she was ""disbelieving to be perfectly honest""
Jones starred in Coda, a film about the daughter of deaf parents, and her co-star Troy Kotsur made history as the first ever deaf Bafta film winner.
Delivering his best supporting actor acceptance speech via an interpreter, he said: ""I think it's all great you're recognising my work from all the way across the sea, it's truly amazing.""
Another US performer, Ariana DeBose, won best supporting actress for playing Anita in Steven Spielberg's new version of the musical West Side Story.
""This means so much to me, I'm somebody who sings, dances, acts,"" she said. ""I speak dance better than I speak English.""

Sir Kenneth Branagh's Belfast was named outstanding British film, while sci-fi saga Dune won five awards in total - best score for Hans Zimmer plus best cinematography, production design, sound and special visual effects.
James Bond's latest outing No Time To Die won two prizes including the EE Rising Star award for Lashana Lynch.

""I would like to thank the women of this country who taught me what it is to be in this industry as a dark-skinned woman,"" she told the ceremony. ""I thank you for laying the foundation for people like me.""
The ceremony was held at the Royal Albert Hall and was hosted by Australian comic actress Rebel Wilson, who largely kept the atmosphere light but did refer to the Russian invasion of Ukraine on a couple of occasions.
After the In Memoriam section, paying tribute to film industry figures who have died over the past 12 months, she said: ""Our thoughts are also at this time with the people afflicted by the conflict in Ukraine.""
And in a segment about sign language, she raised her middle finger, saying it was ""the gesture for Putin"".
Australian actress Rebel Wilson hosted the ceremony at the Royal Albert Hall
The war was a topic of conversation on the red carpet earlier, when Cumberbatch said he was aware badges like his ""could be dismissed as tokenism"".
""This [ceremony] is a celebration of an industry that's about imagery, and images speaking as loud as if not louder sometimes than words. So it's a small gesture,"" he told BBC News.
""But away from this, what we all have to do is continue to put pressure on our politicians as far as the refugee crisis goes, continue to put pressure on the Putin regime, continue to help in any which way we can - whether that's through donations or housing refugees, all of which I'm looking to do and have done.""
Fellow best actor nominee Stephen Graham, who was wearing a blue and yellow bow, said it was ""vital"" to acknowledge the war at the event.
""I want to show my support and solidarity for what people are going through,"" he said.
Bafta chairman Krishnendu Majumdar told the audience before the ceremony: ""We are hugely grateful to the journalists and film-makers covering Ukraine, many of whom are Bafta members, who are bravely reporting and documenting the conflict and humanitarian crisis.""
Star Wars actress Daisy Ridley presented an award
Black Widow and Little Women star Florence Pugh was also among the presenters
Dame Shirley Bassey then opened the event with a performance of her classic James Bond theme Diamonds Are Forever.
Big names returned to the Royal Albert Hall after a subdued affair last year, when many nominees appeared via Zoom amid tight Covid-19 restrictions.
No Bafta Fellowship or other lifetime achievement award was presented on Sunday, after last year's recipient Noel Clarke was accused, external by multiple women of sexual harassment following his win. 
Clarke said he was ""deeply sorry"" for some of his actions but ""vehemently"" denied sexual misconduct.

364,364,"'Without TikTok, I'd still be a wedding singer'","Sun, 13 Mar 2022 00:54:43 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-60706269,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-60706269?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,The video-sharing platform's new SoundOn service will let people distribute their own music.,"'Without TikTok, I'd still be a wedding singer'
TikTok's viral sensations have been reshaping the musical landscape for some time. 
For Chloe Adams, rather than touring the country singing at weddings, she can now exploit the video-sharing platform's new music service SoundOn.
The space offers unsigned artists a way to upload songs and the metadata, get paid and find distribution.
Before SoundOn's launch last week, Chloe had already attracted more than 1.2 million followers on TikTok.
Like so many hits, her song Dirty Thoughts quickly attracted the TikTok audience first. It has since become popular on Spotify, with nearly 10 million streams.
""I became aware that building a large following on TikTok, or having my song go viral on TikTok, were some of the only ways that emerging artists break through these days,"" said the 24-year-old, who lives in Leicester.
""Before releasing and playing my original music became my full-time work, I was part of a wedding band and would play at tonnes of weddings around the country. 
""I was the lead singer and played my acoustic guitar too, that's where I'd be right now if I had no way to release my original music online.""
Before SoundOn, artists behind the viral tracks used to have to leave TikTok to find distribution options.
Now they can do everything in one place, using the app to push their music out to all the other streaming platforms, including Resso, Apple Music, Spotify, Pandora, Deezer and Tencent's Joox.
David Mogendorff, TikTok's UK head of artist partnerships, told the BBC: ""It feels like any new emerging artist in the UK is using TikTok as a place to get out there to start showing people what they can do, and to grow a fanbase.""
SoundOn pays out 100% royalties to music creators in the first year and 90% after that, so the idea is it empowers new and undiscovered artists and allows their popularity to snowball. There are also no administrative fees.
'Artist-friendly'
Although artists have been releasing music on platforms like YouTube for years now, some entry-level singers have struggled to make money - with only videos attracting a lot of views able to cash in on adverts.   
With SoundOn, the artists have more artistic autonomy over what they release but they also have more power when it comes to signing with a potential record label, which is something they might choose to do further down the line.
""We want to do something that's really artist-friendly at that early point in their careers. Every penny counts and we wanted to give people a service that really works for them,"" said Mr Mogendorff. 
The technology, which is owned by the Chinese internet giant ByteDance, means the artists can choose the model that is right for them, and choose to remain completely independent, but the bar is high.
""We have quite a strict moderation and editorial service in place to ensure people are uploading songs that belong to them and are appropriate for our community guidelines,"" he added.
SoundOn is now fully launched in the US, UK, Brazil and Indonesia with not just Chloe, but Abby Roberts, Games We Play and Muni Long all signed up.
Lil Nas X went viral on TikTok with his song Old Town Road
The ability for streaming services to receive music directly from SoundOn has been largely welcomed by the industry. 
Nigel Harding, vice-president of artist relations at Deezer, told the BBC, ""Launching SoundOn is a completely logical move for TikTok.
""The platform has a massive reach and a very strong music community, which of course creates a great appeal for emerging artists.
""From Lil Nas X and Olivia Rodrigo to more emerging talent like PinkPantheress and Shygirl — TikTok and other social platforms are fast becoming the default way to launch a music career.""
SoundOn will offer a range of support for artists, including audience insight and development advice from a dedicated artist team.
Beyond distribution, artists are mindful of getting their music in front of the right audience and that will always include traditional methods too, like buying albums and merchandise or going to gigs.

They could join the Cornish pasty as a food given legal protection against imitation and misuse
The Cornish pasty, Gower salt marsh lamb, Anglesey sea salt and now... Welsh leeks?
Leeks grown in Wales could be given Protected Geographical Indication (PGI) status and international recognition if an application, external is successful.
The vegetable has been synonymous with Wales and formed part of its culture going back at least 1,000 years, according to food historian Carwyn Graves.
Mr Graves said the ability to grow leeks in Wales' milder climate all year round had historically helped prevent malnutrition.
Farmer John Addams-Williams said the national vegetable and emblem was unique and needed ""to be protected"".
What is PGI status?
One of the UK's most recognisable foods, the Cornish pasty was awarded protected status in 2011
In the UK, PGI status is awarded by the UK government to protect and promote named regional food products that have a reputation or noted characteristics specific to that area. 
There are worldwide schemes to obtain PGI status, which must comply with strict World Trade Organization rules.
Should St David's Day be a national bank holiday?

Salt marsh lamb receives protected status
There are currently 18 Welsh items on the UK Geographical Indication (GI) list, external, which includes the prestigious PGI designation.
If accepted, it will mean only Welsh leeks will be able to be sold with the UK PGI logo, guaranteeing the leeks were grown in Wales.
Grown slow, taste strong
Farmer John Addams-Williams says Welsh leeks are unique in flavour and appearance
Mr Addams-Williams, who works at Puffin Produce in Haverfordwest, Pembrokeshire, which applied for the new status, said it would represent ""a huge opportunity"" for the agricultural sector in Wales.
""Our leeks are different to those sold elsewhere - we need to support Welsh industry,"" he said.
Many leeks sold in Wales are grown elsewhere, but Mr Addams-Williams said Welsh leeks were grown slower, have a stronger flavour and a ""vibrant flag"" used in national dishes such as Welsh cawl.
""The more things we have for our national identity - whether that be a daffodil or a leek - is very important and we need to protect the status. It is all part of our culture and history and the more we do the better it can be.""
Why are leeks so important in Wales?
Food historian Carwyn Graves says leeks have always been a symbol for Welsh people
Food historian Carwyn Graves said: ""Leeks go back a lot longer than people would expect.
""Many countries have got plants symbolising them and some of those date back a few hundred years, but the Welsh leek may date back to the very first origins of Welsh nationhood.""
He said there were tales of leeks being used by Welsh soldiers as a distinguishing marker during the Saxon era (410-1066AD), and of battles in leek fields.
While there is not enough evidence to prove these narratives beyond doubt, Mr Graves said ""people were referring to leeks by the early Middle Ages as a kind of marker of the Welsh, so the mythology has been around for at least 1,000 years"".
Queen presents St David's Day leeks
A toast to Welsh whisky? Maybe by next Christmas
Welsh cheese awarded protected status
He said leeks had also been used to symbolise Welsh people in the arts.
Shakespeare's Henry V, written in about 1599, speaks of Welsh men wearing leeks in their caps, while an anonymous ballad from a similar time speaks of the vegetable being worn on St David's Day.
Unlike other nations' symbols, such as tulips in the Netherlands, Mr Graves said the leek was actually useful to Welsh communities.
He said they were ""probably one of the main things that kept the Welsh from scurvy, external"" as they grew all year round in Wales' milder climate.
""The leek is a great vegetable, really versatile and tasty, and one of the shortcomings we have in Wales is we don't grow enough veg and fruit here,"" he added.
""If more leeks were grown here it would only be a good thing.""
Giving PGI status to Welsh leeks would have a knock-on effect for other Welsh produce, a farming union says
Glyn Roberts, who is president of the Farmers Union of Wales, said PGI status would further increase awareness of Welsh produce.
""PGI status is more important now than it has been because we are in a global market and the food we produce in Wales is second to none,"" he added.

366,366,Isak Munda: The Orissa labourer who became a YouTube star,"Sun, 13 Mar 2022 00:59:28 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-60590121,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-60590121?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,Isak Munda says the platform has changed his life since he started posting videos.,"Isak Munda: The Orissa labourer who became a YouTube star
Isak Munda turned to YouTube for work during the Covid lockdown
A daily wage labourer from India's Orissa state turned to YouTube after work dried up during the Covid lockdown - now, he is a social media star. BBC's Sandeep Sahu reports.
When Isak Munda uploaded his first YouTube video in March 2020, he was desperate. A nationwide lockdown imposed to curb Covid had brought India - and the construction industry that employed him - to a halt. It left workers like him, who earned a daily wage, struggling for a living.
Until inspiration struck. 
His children were watching a cartoon on YouTube when Mr Munda overheard an advertisement on how people could earn money from the platform by uploading videos. 
Why not try it, he thought to himself - he didn't have anything to lose. So, he scoured YouTube videos for tips and began with simple food videos. 
In his first video, Mr Munda sits with a full plate of food - rice, dal, greens, a tomato and a chili - which he finishes in silence after greeting viewers.  It didn't take off like he had hoped.
""For about a week, no-one watched my video. I was disheartened,"" he says.  
He decided to give it another shot - he returned to YouTube for help and found that many creators also promoted their videos on other social platforms.
""I opened an account on Facebook and shared my videos there. This time, it worked - 10, 12 people watched my videos.""
Soon, he had his first viral video in which he relishes basi pakhala, a fermented rice dish popular in Orissa.
""It got me over 20,000 subscribers in a few days. People from all over the world - the US, Brazil, Mongolia - watched it,"" he recalls.
It's all the encouragement he needed.
Two years on, Mr Munda's channel, external - Isak Munda Eating - has more than 800,000 subscribers and his videos have been watched more than a 100 million times. Mr Munda himself is now visibly comfortable in front of the camera as he hosts village ""chicken parties"" and forages for mushrooms with his family. 
Last year, he was praised by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his monthly radio show for ""blending culture and cuisine"" to become an ""internet sensation"". 
The lockdown cost millions of migrant workers their jobs
""I was over the moon, and my subscriptions went up,""an ecstatic Mr Munda says.
Conquering YouTube through YouTube  
Mr Munda's videos fall into the ""mukbang"" genre of YouTube videos - people eat huge amounts of food, sometimes speaking to their viewers as they do it. 
The trend started around 2010 in South Korea and Japan, and then spread around the world. Millions subscribe to popular mukbang channels, including MaddyEats from India.
The genre's fans say they like playing mukbang videos in the background while they eat, especially if they are eating alone - they say it makes them feel less lonely. 
But Mr Munda didn't know any of this when he began posting. He just went through different categories of videos before settling on food, which he knew he could cook with his wife's help.
""I thought viewers would be interested in seeing what our lives look like through food,"" he says. 
And YouTube was his teacher - it's where he researched what camera to buy, how to shoot and edit videos, and even the recipes for the dishes he wanted to film himself eating. He withdrew 3,000 rupees ($39; £30) from his savings - a hefty sum for him - and purchased a smart phone to make videos. He paid the full amount in instalments. 
He didn't finish school and knew little English. But he taught himself to use email, and social media to spread the word about his channel. He also learnt to use Google translate to add subtitles to his videos. 
And he has got better. 
The first video is just him eating his lunch, filmed in a single take. ""Hello, friends,"" he says in Hindi. ""I'm about to eat what you see on this plate"". After explaining what it is, he relishes his meal.
But by February 2022 the videos are different. He doesn't shoot every meal or every day - instead he chooses special occasions, such as a village party.
Indians from everywhere comment on his videos, comparing the food he is eating to what's cooked in their homes. 
Many admire how he shared his life with no artifice. ""Their community feasting looks like so much fun,"" writes one viewer, and another says, ""He actually knows the value of food and how to respect it"". 
Over time, Mr Munda's repertoire has expanded. From home-cooked close to his heart, he's moved on to taking requests from his followers to cook and eat different dishes. The northern Indian staple, aloo parathas, or  potato-stuffed flatbreads, and the Indian take on chow mein, have made an appearance. 
Mr Munda's wife and children often feature in his videos
Food challenges are also a part of the menu - in a rice eating challenge, he cooked the rice over a fire in the ground and then enjoyed it with his family. 
""We still eat simple food everyday,"" he says, although they can afford to eat meat more frequently now. 
A future for his children
When he worked as a daily wage labourer, Mr Munda earned around 250 rupees a day, for 18 to 20 days of work in a month. This was barely enough for a comfortable living for a family of six, and his parents.
As his channel grew popular, Mr Munda's income jumped to around 300,000 rupees a month. 
But when views go down, so does his income. He is now earning 60,000-70,000 rupees a month. 
Still, with the money he's earned so far, Mr Munda has built a two-storied concrete house where his old ramshackle hut once stood. He says he's spent around 200,000 rupees on it. 
He has saved money for his children's education, bought a second-hand car, and a laptop on which he edits videos.
He has also become a local celebrity, and often throws lavish parties for the villagers, complete with chicken dishes. 
Mr Munda's next goal: enrol his children in an English-medium school in the nearest town. 
""I want to give them the best possible education. If I could do this with my limited education, I am sure they will do much better if they study higher.""

MOTD analysis: How 'sensational' Cristiano Ronaldo dominated Tottenham Hotspur
Cristiano Ronaldo says there ""are no limits"" for Manchester United after his hat-trick helped them beat Tottenham Hotspur.
Ronaldo's first United hat-trick since 2008 earned his club a 3-2 win and took his overall career goal tally to 807 - with some claiming that saw him break a world record for goals scored.
""Tremendously happy with my first hat-trick since I came back to Old Trafford!"" the Portugal forward wrote on Instagram.
""Nothing beats the feeling of being back on the pitch and helping the team with goals and effort.
""We've proven once again that we can beat any team in any given day, as long as we work hard and stand together as one. There are no limits for Man United! No matter what! Let's go, Devils!""
'A staggering performance' - Shearer on Ronaldo's response to his critics
The performance came a week after Ronaldo missed the Manchester derby amid suggestions he had flown to Portugal, having been told he was dropped.
United boss Ralf Rangnick subsequently rejected the allegation and said the 37-year-old had been ruled out with a hip injury.
However, after what the German described as Ronaldo's best performance ""on and off the ball"" since he came to the club as interim manager in November, he wondered if it was worth repeating the player's build-up.
""We were just joking that maybe it makes sense to send him to Portugal for three days, then have him not train for two and then have him back, by the way he performed on a similar kind of level on Thursday in training,"" said Rangnick. 
""I decided after that training session to play him today even though he has not trained for a week. Maybe we have to do that for the rest of the season.""

Ronaldo hat-trick 'his best performance' - Rangnick
Ronaldo's impact at United has been questioned as their season has unravelled.
Yet only Liverpool's Mohamed Salah has scored more than the 37-year-old's 12 Premier League goals and no United player has scored more than half his overall total of 18 in all competitions.
Midfielder Paul Pogba has no doubts about Ronaldo's value to United.
""He has never been a problem,"" said the France international. 
""If you have the best striker in history in our team, it cannot be a problem. Today he showed why he is Cristiano Ronaldo. The performance from him and all the team was very brilliant.""
Is Ronaldo the all-time top scorer?
There had been claims that Ronaldo became recognised as Fifa's all-time top scorer with his hat-trick, passing Czech-Austrian Josef Bican's 805.
But Fifa does not keep an official list of goalscorers.
The Czech FA says Bican, who died in 2001, scored 821 goals and unofficial statisticians RSSSF , external- which initially reported the 805 figure - now says he has scored more than 950 goals.
That includes strikes in amateur and reserve games and for regional teams.
Ronaldo is definitely football's all-time top scorer of top-level players by quite some way (even if we do not know how much by).
Brazil legends Pele and Romario and Real Madrid and Hungary icon Ferenc Puskas are all somewhere in the 700s too - but numbers vary from report to report.
Lionel Messi is next on 759 goals for Argentina (80), Barcelona (672) and Paris St-Germain (seven).
Ronaldo has some way to go to beat the top three names on the RSSSF list (which all include unofficial games), Germany's Erwin Helmchen (987+), Bican and England's Ronald Rooke (929+).

Man Utd 3-2 Spurs: Ronaldo is never a problem - Pogba
'The guy is a genius' - United legends react
Sky Sports pundits were in awe of Ronaldo's performance.
Ex-United defender Gary Neville said: ""Cristiano Ronaldo was absolutely sensational. What a response to last weekend, when he missed out.
""[The first goal] was absolutely brilliant. Ronaldo was the star of the show. It was a special goal.
""It stuns me that someone so talented and so skilful can be such a good header of a ball.
""He is so single-minded. He thinks he is the greatest of all-time and he wants to play all the time. These are goals scored at the highest levels.""
Former United captain Roy Keane added: ""Ronaldo has had criticism but the way he turned up tonight - he's been doing that throughout his career. Amazing.
""He has a huge part to play in the rebuilding of the club. You need Ronaldo in your team when he's producing like that. 
""Has he been at his best this season? Probably not, but when he's playing, you have a better chance of winning football matches. If he's playing week in, week out, he will produce for you.
""It's about moments. Ronaldo has done that for years. He produces those moments.
""Scoring goals is the hardest part of the game. To score that many goals, what more can you say? The guy is a genius.""

I will not lose my ambition - Conte
Tottenham manager Antonio Conte also praised Ronaldo's performance, saying the Portuguese was, along with Messi, the greatest player of the modern era.
However, he also has to deal with the startling inconsistency of his team.
Tottenham started a sequence of seven games with a home defeat by Wolves, since which they have won a game, then lost the next one, three times.
It leaves Tottenham's season filled with uncertainty - they are still in with a chance of a top four spot, but are equally at risk of missing out on European qualification altogether.
Conte was more reflective than after the recent defeat at Burnley, when he suggested he was ready to walk out on the club. However, he did underline that while he was prepared to tolerate not contending for major honours in the short term, he would not do so forever.
""I am enjoying my time at Tottenham,"" he said. 
""This is a different situation compared to my past. In my past, I fought to win titles and trophies. 
""This is a big challenge. We are trying to build something important. 
""I have patience. I like the work we are doing. At the same time, I don't want to lose my ambition. That must be clear for everybody.""

Wood was outclassed over the first half of the fight
Leigh Wood produced a brutal last-round knockout of Michael Conlan to retain his WBA 'Regular' featherweight title amid worrying scenes in Nottingham.
The powerful punch sent Conlan through the ropes and on to the floor and he was later carried from the arena on a stretcher and taken to hospital.
Conlan posted a video on Instagram on Sunday morning saying ""I'm all good"".
England's Wood had himself been knocked down in the first round and was losing before the late knockout.
Wood v Conlan round-by-round coverage
Wood, who stopped his celebrations as his opponent received immediate medical treatment, told broadcaster Dazn immediately after the fight: ""I just hope Michael is all right; I can't celebrate until I know he is.
""He is so tough and it was a bad knockout so I just want to see he is all right.""
And Belfast fighter Conlan gave an update on his condition from hospital hours later, saying his CT scans were clear.
""Congrats to Leigh Wood, congrats to his team, that was the best shot of the night he got me with at the end,"" he said. ""But it is what it is, I'll be back.""
On Twitter, he followed up with: ""Definitely want a rematch.""

Michael Conlan: Belfast fighter 'all good' after knockout defeat
Huge concern for Conlan
Conlan's words on Sunday morning will come as a huge relief for all concerned.
Wood was in tears at the post-fight news conference and admitted: ""I'm in an emotional state and there have been some tears.
""I heard he is up and talking but I would like to see him.""
Promoter Eddie Hearn called Wood's win ""one of the greatest comebacks"" but added ""we're all praying for Michael"".
""It looked a masterclass from Michael and coming into the 12th I could not see a way Leigh could turn the fight around,"" Hearn said.
""Michael was two ahead going into the last round - Leigh had to knock him out in the 12th and he did.
""I would love to celebrate but all our thoughts are with Michael.""
Wood fights back after first-round knockdown
Wood seemed to be heading for a quick defeat as Conlan made a superb start
Wood, 33, won the 'regular' version of the WBA title with a points win over China's Xu Can in July at Matchroom's Fight Camp, staged in Hearn's garden in Brentwood, Essex, because of Covid-19 restrictions.
Wood was set to fight at his hometown venue on the undercard of Carl Froch's IBF super-middleweight world title fight against Lucian Bute 10 years ago, but his bout did not go ahead.
However, Wood, who was in the crowd that day cheering on his fellow Nottingham boxer as he beat Bute with a fifth-round knockout, called the opportunity to fight in front of a crowd of just under 10,000 people at the same venue, the Motorpoint Arena, ""a fairy tale"".
His hopes nearly ended inside the opening three minutes when he was caught late in the first round by a brilliantly timed and brutally powerful overhand left.
Previously unbeaten, Conlan was fighting for a world title in his 17th professional fight after a glittering amateur career that earned him an Olympic bronze medal and gold medals in both the World and European Amateur Championships and was close to winning the fight in the second.
But Wood showed great character and desire, despite suffering a cut over his eye in the fourth round, as both men repeatedly traded blows in a hugely entertaining clash, which was described as the ""best fight I've ever seen"" by two-weight former world champion Carl Frampton.
Wood gradually started to work his way back into the fight, aided by some great shots to Conlan's body, before the away fighter was judged to have been knocked down in the 11th, despite arguments from his corner, who told referee Steve Gray their fighter had slipped.
But, after one minute 25 seconds of the final round, the fight ended in dramatic circumstances. Wood caught Conlan with a glancing blow to the head. Conlan dropped his arms, looking exhausted, and Wood landed the knockout blow.
What next?
The WBA 'super' featherweight belt is vacant, Mexican Emanuel Navarrette, is the WBO champion, and Mark Magsayo of the Philippines holds the WBC crown after ending the long reign of American Gary Russell Jr with a majority points decision win in January.
But Wood will be very keen to watch the fight for the IBF title as Spanish title holder Kiko Martinez takes on England's Josh Warrington in Warrington's home city of Leeds on 26 March.
If Warrington beats Martinez for the second time in his career, that could set up an all-English world title fight at a stadium, with Leeds United's Elland Road and Nottingham Forest's City Ground potential venues.
Hearn said: ""If Leigh Wood fights in Nottingham again it will be at the City Ground - that has been his dream for a long time.""
Agyarko and Harper win undercard fights
Terri Harper stepped up to lightweight on her return to the ring
Caoimhin Agyarko extended his professional record to 11 wins from 11 contests.
He was never in trouble against Mexican Juan Carlos Rubio, who showed great courage to reach the final bell.
Two judges gave Agyarko every round (100-90), and the third judge called it 98-92, as the Belfast fighter kept hold of his WBA international middleweight title.
Former women's super-featherweight world champion Terri Harper got back to winning ways after stepping up to lightweight with a big points win over Argentina's Yamila Belen Abellaneda.
Harper, 25, said she was ""embarrassed"" by her loss to Alycia Baumgardner in November, which saw her relinquish the title she had held since July 2019.
Harper started well against Belen Abellaneda but sustained a bad-looking cut over her left eye in the third round.
Belen Abellaneda kept coming forward but took a lot of punishment with Harper having success with lefts to the head and body and some powerful uppercuts on her way to a deserved win.
Irish lightweight Gary Cully maintained his unbeaten record with his 14th professional win as he knocked out Miguel Vasquez in five rounds after earlier putting him down in the third.

Joe Root - Performance in first Test shows step forward for England
England's draw against West Indies in the first Test is a ""huge step forward"" after a ""difficult year"", says captain Joe Root.
Root's side have won only one of their past 15 Test matches and were beaten 4-0 by Australia in this winter's Ashes.
But they showed promise across the final two days in Antigua before being thwarted in their push for victory by a stubborn West Indies on Saturday.
""We showed a huge amount of character,"" Root told BBC Sport.
England suffered an all-too-familiar collapse on day one as they slumped to 48-4, before Jonny Bairstow's superb 140 helped them post 311.
After West Indies replied with 375, the tourists declared on 349-6 on day five following centuries from Zak Crawley (121) and Root (109), before the hosts reached 147-4 at the close.
England failed to pass 300 once in 10 innings in the Ashes, after which director of cricket Ashley Giles, head coach Chris Silverwood and batting coach Graham Thorpe all left their roles.
""I'm really pleased with the way we played, especially give the position we were in after that first hour,"" said Root, who now has 24 Test centuries.
""The guys stayed calm and showed great maturity to get us to a total, especially off the back of a difficult winter and a difficult year where we've not scored anywhere near enough runs.""

On a docile pitch, England only stood an outside chance of victory on the final day, but took four wickets for eight runs either side of tea to boost their hopes, before Nkrumah Bonner and Jason Holder dug in with a stand of 80 that lasted 35.5 overs.
The tourists were limited by the absence of fast bowler Mark Wood because of an elbow injury.
""The way the guys stuck at it, especially having one bowler down as well, showed a huge amount of character and it was a huge step forward in many respects,"" said Root.
""No-one stopped believing or gave up all day. We really did give ourselves the best chance of winning this game.""
Wood, who only bowled five overs on day three before sustaining the injury, is now a major doubt for the second Test in Barbados, which begins on Wednesday.
England said Wood tried to bowl in the nets before the start of day five but struggled with ""acute pain"".
Ollie Robinson missed the first Test because of a back injury, but returned to training during the match, while uncapped duo Saqib Mahmood and Matthew Fisher are the other seam-bowling options in the squad.
England left out James Anderson and Stuart Broad, their top two leading wicket-takers in Tests, for this series, but neither is understood to be on the list of reserves.
""Mark will be assessed in Barbados and we'll see how he is when we get there,"" said Root.
""It's bitterly disappointing for him because you know how much it hurts him. He'll never let anyone down and he's a wholehearted player.""

Six Nations highlights: England 15-32 Ireland
Pity the late-comers.
If any of the 81,500-odd strong crowd missed the train or picked up a puncture en route to Twickenham, they would have wondered what they stumbled into early in the second half.
A chasing Maro Itoje scragged Hugo Keenan and pints were spilled in delight. A scrum wheeled and bellows of celebration swept down from the top tier. Ireland wing Andrew Conway was shunted over the touchline and you would have thought Marcus Smith had dived over the tryline.
Everything was amplified. Every inch of territory magnified, every phase loaded with meaning. Twickenham, usually slow to stir, was a frothing, frenzied cauldron. Reserve and perspective was kicked to the curb. Blood was up, and players and fans alike sniffed the extraordinary.
Amid the sound and fury, there would be no reason to count off the players. England were level on the scoreboard and matching Ireland on the pitch. The gap left by their missing man was absent itself.

But it was Charlie Ewels' second-minute red card that conjured that fever-dream atmosphere.
Plenty were yet to make their seats for his dismissal. With the clock stopped at 82 seconds and trays of plastic pints still being ferried up the aisles, French referee Mathieu Raynal turned his eyes screenwards.
The midfield collision looked bad on first viewing and, whatever angle the TMO offered, it didn't get any better. Ewels, upright into the tackle, put himself and James Ryan at risk of injury and his team at risk of a red. The two second rows' heads bashed together and the red card duly, correctly popped out of Raynal's pocket.
Twickenham howled its disapproval. The contest was ruined inside two minutes. A yardstick to measure England's progress hopelessly skewed.
Those fears appeared founded at first. Johnny Sexton booted the first points from the subsequent penalty. James Lowe raced in for the first try on six minutes. Caelan Doris flattened brave Harry Randall on his way into the corner on 12 minutes.
Had that Doris score stood, Ireland would have been 13-0 ahead with a conversion to come and perhaps already over the horizon.
But Raynal, whose early call placed him under fearsome scrutiny for the rest of the match, ruled Itoje, immense throughout, had timed a dive through a ruck just right to force Ireland's Jamison Gibson-Park to knock-on in the build-up.
England reprieved. And they continued to wriggle off the hook. Tadhg Beirne forced an offload with the line beckoning. A line-out throw, five out from England's line, flew over the back. Doris threw a pass behind Conor Murray as he bore down on full-back Freddie Steward.
But Ireland's inaccuracy was not even half the story.
Instead the thrill was England's players shredding the script that came stapled to Ewels' red card.
They raged against the snuffing out of their slender Six Nations hopes. They watched Tom Curry and Kyle Sinckler hobble out the fray and still their belief held.
England had won 22 of their previous 25 home Six Nations games before Ireland's win
They fell back on their few remaining advantages. Ireland's scrum was sent into a tailspin time and again. They played the percentages. They kicked long and high to keep the green tide at bay for as long as possible.
And, when neither was an option, they defended ferociously. There was one instance that summed up the commitment. In the shadow of his own posts, Ellis Genge dumped Josh van der Flier flat on his back before Sam Simmonds threw himself under the wheels of a rumbling Tadhg Furlong to send the Ireland prop sprawling.
The crowd fed off every act of bravery. The players fed off every decibel. And for a heady 20 minutes or so, together they whipped up a whirlwind that seemed like it might just carry them to the most improbable of wins.
It wasn't to be. Ireland rode the storm and, as was always more likely, England blew themselves out.
But on the final whistle, as the two sets of players shared embraces and notes on a surreal, scintillating contest, both knew the 32-15 scoreline wasn't the headline.
""It was a crazy old game,"" said Ireland coach Andy Farrell afterwards. ""If you paid good money for that at the stadium, I'm sure you would be happy.""
England certainly were.
Coach Eddie Jones called it ""a foundation game for us"".
Captain Courtney Lawes said it set a ""benchmark"" in terms of energy and belief.

Relive Ireland's dramatic win over 14-man England
Hooker Jamie George went further. ""This sounds ridiculous but it's one of the proudest days I've had in an England shirt,"" he said.
""I feel quite emotional from this game and the feedback we had from the crowd.
""To play like that with 14 men for 78 minutes against an Ireland team respected as one of the best in the world takes some doing and I'm proud to be part of the group.""
This new-look England have gone to various places to forge bonds over the past few months; paddle-boarding in Jersey, cider farms in Bristol, sea swimming in Brighton.
But the depths they went for each other in adversity against Ireland will have been the most effective team-building exercise of all.
Next weekend, France will test those bonds. However England, stung by defeat and stronger in spirit, will test France too.

Since the start of the 2017-18 season, only Jamie Vardy (21) and Luka Milivojevic (20) have scored more penalties in the Premier League than Mohamed Salah with 18
Another game, another goal. Mohamed Salah scored once again for Liverpool on Saturday, at the end of a week in which his uncertain future returned to the spotlight.
The Egypt forward, 29, struck his 20th Premier League goal of the season from the penalty spot as Liverpool kept up the pressure on title rivals Manchester City with a 2-0 win at Brighton.
On Friday, manager Jurgen Klopp said it was up to Salah, who has 153 goals in 238 appearances for the club, to decide whether he signs a new contract.
So, how does the future look for Salah and Liverpool?
Liverpool beat Brighton to move three points behind Manchester City
It is Salah's decision on new contract, says Klopp
What is Salah's situation?
Salah's current deal runs until the end of next season.
It has been reported, external that talks between player and club have broken down, and a new deal will only be possible if Liverpool offer improved terms.
Since joining from Italian club Roma in June 2017, Salah has helped the Reds win the Premier League, Champions League, League Cup, Fifa Club World Cup and Uefa Super Cup.
Klopp admitted on Friday that the club had done all it could to persuade the forward to stay, adding there was ""no rush"" over a deal and the situation was ""completely fine"" despite a lack of progress.
After Klopp's comments, Salah's agent Ramy Abbas Issa tweeted several laughter emojis, without adding further context.
Salah has previously said he wants to stay, external, but that his future is in Liverpool's hands and he is not asking for ""crazy stuff"".

How badly would Liverpool miss Salah?
Losing the two-time Premier League Golden Boot winner would be a huge blow for the club.
The Egyptian's second-half penalty at Amex Stadium saw him become the first Liverpool player to score 20 or more times in four different Premier League seasons.
Only former captain Steven Gerrard (212) has now been directly involved in more Premier League goals for Liverpool than Salah, who has 115 goals and 43 assists in the competition.
The January arrival of Colombia forward Luis Diaz, who scored his second goal for the club in Saturday's win, has bolstered Klopp's attacking options alongside the likes of Diogo Jota and Sadio Mane.
Jota and Mane have contributed 12 league goals each this season - the pair scoring 31 goals between them across all competitions.
By comparison, Salah has now scored 28 times in 35 games across all competitions in 2021-22 after delivering Liverpool's 2,000th Premier League goal at the Amex.
'Salah must decide if he wants icon status - or money'
Build-up to the match at Brighton was dominated by talk over Salah's future. 
Speaking on BT Sport, former Manchester United defender Rio Ferdinand said it was down to Salah to decide what is more important to him.
""It's up to Mo Salah. What does he want? Does he want to be an absolute idol and icon at Liverpool forever and stay there, or is it about money? We'll find out at the end of this,"" Ferdinand said.
""For the Premier League's sake, I hope Liverpool can keep him.""
Salah won the Champions League with Liverpool in 2019
Ex-Liverpool striker Peter Crouch said: ""From Salah's point of view, he can say 'I should be the highest-paid player in the world'. He's been that good. There's no-one better than him in the Premier League at the moment.
""If they get held to ransom they're not going to break the pay structure for one player. If Liverpool get offered the right price they may have to look at it,"" Crouch added.
On BBC Radio 5 Live, former Stoke City manager Tony Pulis said he would be ""very surprised"" if Salah did not remain at Anfield, and added his team-mates would accept him being paid more ""because of what he does"".
Meanwhile, ex-Republic of Ireland midfielder Andy Reid said ""clubs all over the world"" will be ""prepared to spend everything"" to sign the former Chelsea player.
""Liverpool will need to break the bank for him,"" Reid added. ""If they don't push those boundaries they will not be able to compete with their rivals. They have to be careful not to upset other players, but they have to be competitive as well.""
Where might Salah go if he leaves?
There are a limited number of clubs who could afford to pay huge wages following the coronavirus pandemic, and European giants such as Barcelona are rumoured to be keen on signing Salah should the opportunity arise.
With France striker Kylian Mbappe admitting he is yet to make a decision on his future before the 23-year-old's contract expires this summer, French heavyweights Paris St-Germain could also be in the market for a new star forward.
It has also been said that Salah would be happy to stay in the Premier League, external with another club.

Brighton 0-2 Liverpool: I don't like to play against Brighton - Jurgen Klopp
However, with Chelsea in chaos after the Premier League disqualified owner Roman Abramovich, it leaves perhaps only Manchester City and Manchester United as realistic options if Salah decided to remain in England.
But a move to either Manchester club would be unthinkable for many Liverpool supporters and tarnish his standing, regardless of his achievements at Anfield.
For now at least, Salah and Liverpool have their eyes firmly set on overhauling Manchester City at the top of the Premier League, as the Reds chase an unprecedented quadruple.
Klopp said ""something was not right"" with Salah as he was substituted because of injury against Brighton - though the forward suggested it was nothing serious. Liverpool travel to Arsenal next, on Wednesday.
On the title race, Klopp said: ""You expect Manchester City to win every game when you watch them play.
""The only thing we can do is win as many football games as possible. We're ready. We don't need to call it a title race, we just want to win games.""

374,374,Ukraine crisis: US warns China against helping Russia,"Mon, 14 Mar 2022 03:38:44 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-60732486,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-60732486?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,US officials say Russia asked China for military support and help in evading sanctions.,"Ukraine crisis: US warns China against helping Russia
Mr Sullivan, seen here in a file picture, warned that the US would not allow China to provide a ""lifeline"" to Russia
China will face consequences if it helps Russia evade sanctions in its invasion of Ukraine, the US says.
Unnamed US officials told multiple news outlets that China had signalled willingness to provide military assistance to Russia.
The Chinese foreign ministry accused the US of spreading disinformation. Russia denied asking Beijing for military help.
The exchanges came before top US and Chinese officials met in Rome.  
Media outlets, citing Washington officials, say that Russia has in recent days asked China specifically for military equipment, including drones.
On Monday, the US warned allies that China had suggested it was open to a move to provide military and economic support, media reports said. 
The report came as US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan met China's top diplomat, Yang Jiechi, for talks in Rome.
""Mr Sullivan raised a range of issues in US-China relations, with substantial discussion of Russia's war against Ukraine,"" a readout of the meeting said. ""They also underscored the importance of maintaining open lines of communication between the United States and China.""
In an earlier CNN interview, Mr Sullivan said the US was ""communicating directly, privately to Beijing that there will absolutely be consequences for large-scale sanctions evasion efforts or support to Russia to backfill them"".
""We will not allow that to go forward and allow there to be a lifeline to Russia from these economic sanctions from any country, anywhere in the world,"" he said.
He added that while the US believed China was aware that Russian leader Vladimir Putin was ""planning something"" before the invasion happened, Beijing ""may not have understood the full extent of it"".
Russia's military action is now in its third week and has horrified much of the world
""Because it's very possible that [Mr] Putin lied to them the same way that he lied to Europeans and others,"" Mr Sullivan said.
In response, a spokesman for the foreign ministry in Beijing, Zhao Lijian, said the US had ""been spreading disinformation targeting China on the Ukraine issue, with malicious intentions"".
Asked if he could clarify whether China had received a request for military help from Russia, Mr Zhao said this was ""fake news"" but did not deny it directly. He added that China's stance had always been consistent and that China was playing a constructive role in promoting talks. 
President Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov said reports Russia had asked China for military assistance were not true. 
""Russia possesses its own independent potential to continue the operation. As we said, it is going according to plan and will be completed on time and in full,"" he said.
State Department spokesman Ned Price said the US raised concerns with the Chinese delegation ""directly and very clearly"".
China has so far refrained from condemning Russia for the invasion and has said Moscow's ""legitimate security concerns"" should be taken seriously.
When the United Nations General Assembly voted to condemn Russia's invasion earlier this month, China was one of 35 countries that abstained.
But Beijing at the same time has expressed ""unwavering support"" for Ukraine's sovereignty. It has also called for peace and has said it is ready to help end the war through diplomacy. Several countries have urged China to do more to stop Russia's invasion.
The EU and US help Ukraine, China helps Russia; if that's how this goes, then it's a delineation that will make the war in Ukraine an even more consequential one. 
The White House has decided to make public its claim just as President Biden's top security adviser is due to meet China's most senior diplomat. It appears to be a tactical move, to put pressure on China; presumably to either confirm or deny it. 
The bigger aim could be to try to make Xi Jinping weigh up the pros and cons to his current position of what was last week called a ""rock solid"" relationship with Moscow. 
Remember that it was just weeks ago, as the Winter Olympics opened in Beijing, that Presidents Xi and Putin declared a new alliance that had ""no limit"". Military aid could, clearly, be part of that. 
But in the days after Russia's invasion China has condemned the UK, the US and others for giving weapons to Ukraine's military, saying they were adding ""fuel to the fire"".
If the US intelligence assessment is correct and Beijing follows through on that request, then they too would be ""adding fuel"".

A group of Ukrainian children have arrived in the UK to undergo life-saving cancer treatment on the NHS, the health secretary has said.
Sajid Javid said the 21 children would be offered the best possible care in hospitals around the country.
The children and their immediate family members arrived on an urgent flight arranged by the government on Sunday after a plea from Polish officials.
They will be assessed by doctors before being sent to appropriate hospitals.
""I am proud that the UK is offering life-saving medical care to these Ukrainian children, who have been forced out of their home country by the Russian invasion while undergoing medical treatment,"" Mr Javid said.
""I know that the incredible staff in the NHS will ensure they get the best possible care.""
Nine medics from Southampton Children's Hospital flew to Poland to fetch the children.

The government is to set out details of a scheme to allow people in the UK to welcome Ukrainian refugees into their home later - but special provision has been made for the group needing urgent care.

Many children have been evacuated to Poland, where the authorities appealed for help in caring for them.

Campion didn't attend the Baftas as she was at the Directors Guild Awards and the Critics Choice Awards in Los Angeles over the weekend
Netflix's moody Western The Power of the Dog won the top prize at the Bafta Film Awards, picking up best film and best director for Jane Campion.
Its star Benedict Cumberbatch wore a badge to show his support for Ukrainians as he accepted the best director prize on behalf of Campion.
He also said he hopes to offer a place to stay for a Ukrainian refugee.
Cumberbatch was beaten to the best actor award by Will Smith. Joanna Scanlan was named best actress.
Benedict Cumberbatch, pictured with wife Sophie Hunter, wore a blue and yellow badge
Scanlan, who was previously best known for British TV comedies like The Thick Of It and Getting On, triumphed for her performance in the independent film After Love. She played a 60-year-old Muslim convert who suffers an identity crisis following the sudden death of her husband.
""Come on!"" she said on stage in disbelief. ""Some stories have surprise endings don't they?""
She beat a field including Lady Gaga, fellow musician-turned-actress Alana Haim, and Emilia Jones, the daughter of Welsh TV presenter Aled.
Joanna Scanlan said backstage that she was ""disbelieving to be perfectly honest""
Jones starred in Coda, a film about the daughter of deaf parents, and her co-star Troy Kotsur made history as the first ever deaf Bafta film winner.
Delivering his best supporting actor acceptance speech via an interpreter, he said: ""I think it's all great you're recognising my work from all the way across the sea, it's truly amazing.""
Another US performer, Ariana DeBose, won best supporting actress for playing Anita in Steven Spielberg's new version of the musical West Side Story.
""This means so much to me, I'm somebody who sings, dances, acts,"" she said. ""I speak dance better than I speak English.""

""I would like to thank the women of this country who taught me what it is to be in this industry as a dark-skinned woman,"" she told the ceremony. ""I thank you for laying the foundation for people like me.""
The ceremony was held at the Royal Albert Hall and was hosted by Australian comic actress Rebel Wilson, who largely kept the atmosphere light but did refer to the Russian invasion of Ukraine on a couple of occasions.
After the In Memoriam section, paying tribute to film industry figures who have died over the past 12 months, she said: ""Our thoughts are also at this time with the people afflicted by the conflict in Ukraine.""
And in a segment about sign language, she raised her middle finger, saying it was ""the gesture for Putin"".
Australian actress Rebel Wilson hosted the ceremony at the Royal Albert Hall
The war was a topic of conversation on the red carpet earlier, when Cumberbatch said he was aware badges like his ""could be dismissed as tokenism"".
""This [ceremony] is a celebration of an industry that's about imagery, and images speaking as loud as if not louder sometimes than words. So it's a small gesture,"" he told BBC News.
""But away from this, what we all have to do is continue to put pressure on our politicians as far as the refugee crisis goes, continue to put pressure on the Putin regime, continue to help in any which way we can - whether that's through donations or housing refugees, all of which I'm looking to do and have done.""
Fellow best actor nominee Stephen Graham, who was wearing a blue and yellow bow, said it was ""vital"" to acknowledge the war at the event.
""I want to show my support and solidarity for what people are going through,"" he said.
Bafta chairman Krishnendu Majumdar told the audience before the ceremony: ""We are hugely grateful to the journalists and film-makers covering Ukraine, many of whom are Bafta members, who are bravely reporting and documenting the conflict and humanitarian crisis.""
Star Wars actress Daisy Ridley presented an award
Black Widow and Little Women star Florence Pugh was also among the presenters
Dame Shirley Bassey then opened the event with a performance of her classic James Bond theme Diamonds Are Forever.
Big names returned to the Royal Albert Hall after a subdued affair last year, when many nominees appeared via Zoom amid tight Covid-19 restrictions.
No Bafta Fellowship or other lifetime achievement award was presented on Sunday, after last year's recipient Noel Clarke was accused, external by multiple women of sexual harassment following his win. 
Clarke said he was ""deeply sorry"" for some of his actions but ""vehemently"" denied sexual misconduct.

William Hurt, the Oscar-winning US actor whose roles ranged from acclaimed 1980s dramas to Marvel films, has died at the age of 71, US media say.
Hurt won the best actor Oscar in 1986 for playing a prisoner in a Brazilian jail in Kiss of the Spider Woman.
He was nominated two more times in the next two years, for Children of a Lesser God and Broadcast News.
In recent years, he has been known as General Thaddeus ""Thunderbolt"" Ross in five Marvel blockbusters.
Hurt made his Hollywood breakthrough at the start of the 1980s in films including Body Heat alongside Kathleen Turner
Hollywood website Deadline quoted a statement, external from Hurt's son Will as saying: ""It is with great sadness that the Hurt family mourns the passing of William Hurt, beloved father and Oscar winning actor, on March 13, 2022, one week before his 72nd birthday.

Hurt began acting on stage in the 1970s before making his big-screen breakthrough as an obsessed scientist in Altered States, which earned him a best newcomer nomination at the Golden Globes in 1981. 
That year, he also starred as a womanising lawyer in erotic thriller Body Heat, before being cast in The Big Chill and Gorky Park.
Winning an Oscar for playing a gay man who shares a cell with a political prisoner in Kiss of the Spider Woman was ""very isolating"", he later told the Los Angeles Times, external.
""The instant they gave it to me, I thought, God, what do I do now? How am I going to walk into a room and have any other actor trust me?""
That did not stop him getting two more consecutive nominations, though, before roles in The Accidental Tourist, Lost in Space, Contagion and AI. Then came a fourth Oscar nomination for David Cronenberg's A History of Violence in 2006.
He also received Emmy nominations for playing Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson in 2011's Too Big to Fail, and for legal TV drama Damages.
He returned to the theatre in productions including Henry V, A Midsummer Night Dream and Hurlyburly, the latter of which saw him recognised with a nomination at Broadway's Tony Awards. 
Hurt had been diagnosed with prostate cancer
He was regarded as a compelling but complex and often confrontational presence, however. Fame was ""a challenge"" and ""not a happy condition for me"", he admitted.
""It's a privilege and a responsibility, and I'm not sure I carried the responsibility well at times, which is embarrassing,"" he told The Telegraph in 2013, external. ""And I've had to look and be disappointed in myself occasionally for how I behaved in some circumstances.""
He drank heavily for a spell and in a high-profile palimony trial in 1989, former partner Sandra Jennings described his drunken rages.
Another former girlfriend, Children of a Lesser God co-star Marlee Matlin, later accused him of physical and emotional abuse. He apologised ""for any pain I caused"".
The actor revealed in 2018 that he had been diagnosed with terminal prostate cancer.

'Thank you' - reaction to Brady U-turn
Tampa head coach Arians welcomed Brady's change of mind, while the franchise's general manager Jason Licht said he was ""thrilled"". 
""Tom Brady loves to play football as much as anyone I have ever been around,"" said Arians. ""As Tom said, his place right now is on the football field.
""He is still playing at a championship level and was as productive as anyone in the league last season. We are ecstatic that he decided to continue playing and working toward winning another championship.""
Brady played in 10 Super Bowls, including an incredible comeback from 28-3 down against the Atlanta Falcons in 2017, and won a Super Bowl in three different decades.

Licht said: ""We said we would leave all options open for him should he reconsider his retirement.

""Tom is the greatest quarterback of all time who is still playing at an elite level.""

""If there is any item in the field of sports collectibles that needs no embellishment, it is this historic piece: the final touchdown ball of Tom Brady's career,"" wrote Lelands in its description of the ball., external
An anonymous buyer paid $518,628 (£397,592) for it before Brady's retirement U-turn the following day.

More than 2.5 million refugees have fled Ukraine since the invasion, the UN estimates
There will be no limit to the number of Ukrainian refugees who can live with UK host families under a new visa scheme, the government has confirmed.
It is hoped tens of thousands of displaced people will benefit from the Homes for Ukraine refugee scheme.
More details will be set out later, before a website goes live for people to express an interest in helping. 
Hosts will receive £350 a month as a ""thank you"" from the government.
Health Secretary Sajid Javid told BBC Breakfast there would be ""no cap"" on the number of people who can be supported through the scheme.
""I'm pleased that we're doing this because as a country we have a very proud record of offering sanctuary to people from wars and from conflicts,"" he added.
The government has so far faced criticism - including from its own MPs - over the speed and scale of its response to the refugee crisis triggered by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
How to sponsor Ukrainian refugees
How many people have fled Ukraine?
Why I want to share my home with a Ukrainian refugee
Under the new scheme people in the UK will be able to nominate an individual or family to stay with them rent-free, either in their own home or in another property, for at least six months.
Hosts are not required to personally know the refugee they want to host. They will be matched with those seeking refuge in the UK after submitting a form. 
Mr Javid said once refugees arrive they will be allowed to stay in the UK ""for at least three years"".
They will have access to the NHS and other public services, and their children will be able to attend local schools.
Local authorities will also receive £10,500 in extra funding per refugee for support services - with more for children of school age.
Applications to host refugees will be made online and both hosts and refugees will be vetted. 
Levelling Up Secretary Michael Gove will make a statement in Parliament later to set out further details.
Asked if he might host a Ukrainian family himself, Mr Javid said it was something he and his wife were ""starting to have a conversation"" about. 
""Whatever I do at a personal level, I most certainly will be helping,"" he added.
The first hosts and refugees will be matched this week, allowing the first Ukrainians to arrive in the UK through this route in about two weeks' time, the BBC's chief political correspondent Adam Fleming says.
'We've got to help'
Maxine Taylor says she's got spare time and space to host two or three refugees
One of those hoping to help through the new scheme is Maxine Taylor, who lives alone in a four-bedroom house in Godalming, Surrey.
Maxine, who is self-employed and works part-time, says the ""peace and quiet"" of her more rural home might be a better option for traumatised refugees than a busy city.
But she does want more information from the government about the scheme - such as whether or not hosts will be taxed on the £350 monthly payment, and how the matching service will work.
She also wants to make sure anyone she takes in gets the mental health support they will need after fleeing a war zone.
Maxine says she's been wanting to find a way to help Ukrainians ""since day one"" of the invasion, and has felt ""frustrated"" that the government's visa schemes have been ""so slow"" to get off the ground. 
My hopes to host refugees delayed by UK government
""I've just been absolutely horrified by what's going on,"" Maxine says, adding that seeing images of young women and men signing up to fight for their country has ""really touched me"".
""I just feel I'd like to do my bit... we've got to help.""
Organisations such as charities and churches will eventually be able to sponsor refugees, though there is no start date for this phase of the scheme yet.
Homes for Ukraine is the second visa scheme the government has set up since the war broke out.
The first has allowed Ukrainians with an immediate or extended family member in the UK to apply for a family visa to join them.
Some 4,000 visas have so far been granted through that route, the latest Home Office figures show.
The Home Office has defended, external requiring security checks on Ukrainians fleeing Russia's invasion. It says it must ensure the UK helps those in genuine need as it's seen people falsely claim to be Ukrainian.
Labour's London Mayor Sadiq Khan said the UK's plans to help those fleeing Ukraine have been ""embarrassing"" compared with those of other countries.
He told Good Morning Britain that people, businesses and councils were ""ready to step up"" and welcome refugees but the system to do so has been ""far too complicated"".
Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer previously described the Home Office's response as ""too slow, too narrow, too mean"", while Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said Home Secretary Priti Patel should be sacked for ""incompetence, indifference and sheer inhumanity"" in leading the response.
The NSPCC said it had concerns about safety checks on prospective hosts through the Homes for Ukraine scheme.
The children's charity said it was ""vital child protection is built into every stage of the government's and local authorities' response to this crisis"".
Putin to pay for 'war crimes'
Asked about the bombing of a maternity and children's hospital in the city of Mariupol last week, Mr Javid said Russia had made some 31 attacks on health facilities in Ukraine since its invasion.
""These are war crimes and Putin will be held responsible,"" he said.
In a visit to the Hague on Monday, Justice Secretary Dominic Raab said the UK would give financial and technical support to the International Criminal Court to help it investigate the situation in Ukraine.
He said it was vital to ensure anyone who committed war crimes was held to account and that commanders on the ground, as well as the Kremlin, ""need to know that right now"". 
Meanwhile, 21 Ukrainian children with cancer have arrived in the UK to receive NHS treatment, the health secretary said.
The children have been given six-month visas to get them out of Ukraine quickly but Mr Javid told Sky News these would be extended ""to at least three years"".

Elsewhere, the prime minister spoke to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Sunday night.
Boris Johnson pledged ""to pursue more options for bolstering Ukraine's self-defence"", No 10 said, and discussed efforts to end the war.
The government is to send 500 portable electricity generators for use in facilities such as hospitals and shelters which have lost power following the invasion - something President Zelensky made a direct request for.
Mr Johnson condemned the murders of US journalist Brent Renaud and countless innocent Ukrainians, Downing Street said.
The prime minister is hosting a series of meetings with Nordic and Baltic leaders in London and Chequers this week.
No 10 says he will urge them to work together to ensure no further nations fall victim to Vladimir Putin's aggression.

Kyiv's police chief Andriy Nebytov said he had been targeted by Russian soldiers. Two other journalists were injured and taken to hospital.
It is the first reported death of a foreign journalist covering the war in Ukraine. 
One of the injured journalists, Juan Arredondo, told an Italian reporter he had been with Renaud when they came under fire.
""We were across one of the first bridges in Irpin, going to film other refugees leaving, and we got into a car"", he said in a video published on Twitter, external. 
""Somebody offered to take us to the other bridge and we crossed a checkpoint, and they start shooting at us. So the driver turned around, and they kept shooting; there's two of us. My friend is Brent Renaud, and he's been shot and left behind... I saw him being shot in the neck.""

Photographs are circulating online showing a press ID for Renaud issued by the New York Times.
In a statement, the newspaper said it was ""deeply saddened"" to hear of Renaud's death but that he had not been working for the newspaper in Ukraine.
Renaud last worked for the publication in 2015, the Times said, and the press ID he was wearing in Ukraine had been issued years ago. 
Time editor-in-chief and CEO Edward Felsenthal and Ian Orefice, the president and chief operating officer of Time and Time Studios, said they were ""devastated by the loss"".
""As an award-winning filmmaker and journalist, Brent tackled the toughest stories around the world often alongside his brother Craig Renaud,"" the statement said.

Renaud had reported from Afghanistan, Iraq and Haiti. He won a Peabody Award for his work on a 2014 series on Chicago schools, Last Chance High. 
He often worked alongside his brother, Craig, also a filmmaker. It is not known whether Craig also travelled to Ukraine. 
Renaud's death comes less than two weeks after Ukrainian journalist Yevhenii Skaum, a camera operator for the Ukrainian television channel LIVE, was killed when a TV transmission tower in Kviv was hit by shelling. 
A few days later, a British journalist covering the war in Ukraine was shot and wounded after coming under fire in Kyiv.

A British national living in the UK has been accused by police in Hong Kong of jeopardising China's national security and told he faces three years in jail.
Benedict Rogers runs Hong Kong Watch, a charity which campaigns for human rights in the former British colony.
But he has been informed that he faces charges of ""collusion with foreign forces"" if he ever returns there.
Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said the threat was ""unjustifiable"". Mr Rogers said his group would not be silenced.
""We will continue to be a voice for the people of Hong Kong and those brave political prisoners who have been jailed under this authoritarian regime,"" he said.
Hong Kong security law: What is it and is it worrying?
Why China is bent on crushing dissent in Hong Kong
Hong Kong was handed back from British to Chinese rule in 1997, at the end of a 99-year lease.
Beijing agreed to govern it under ""one country, two systems"", granting the city its own legal system, limited democracy with multiple political parties and rights such as freedom of assembly and free speech.
However in 2019 there were mass anti-government and pro-democracy protests against plans to allow extraditions to mainland China.
Clashes between police and activists became increasingly violent and a year later China passed a draconian law targeting secession, subversion and terrorism with punishments of up to life in prison.
The authorities have clamped down hard, arresting scores of activists and opposition politicians.

Hong Kong Watch said police had written to tell Mr Rogers of his offence, and that he faced jail, or a HK$100,000 (£9,800) fine, if he returns to the city.
It is thought to be one of the first times authorities have tried to apply the legislation outside the territory.
Lord Patten, the former colony's last governor, said it was a ""disgraceful example"" of China trying to stamp out freedom of expression in Hong Kong.

Russian-British businessman Lord Lebedev was made a peer by Boris Johnson in July 2020
Michael Gove has said no-one raised security issues with him about Lord Lebedev after reports security services had long-held concerns about him.
The Sunday Times, external claimed the head of MI6 was worried about the Russian-born businessman, and concerns were raised with Boris Johnson in 2020. 
But the PM has denied he intervened to ensure Lord Lebedev's peerage.
Housing Secretary Mr Gove told the BBC the process for appointing peers was ""rigorous"".
He said he had dinner with Lord Lebedev at Boris Johnson's house before the Brexit referendum, but did not know of any possible security concerns.
But Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the PM had ""serious questions to answer"" about the appointment, and has asked the House of Lords Appointment Commission to release the vetting advice they gave to Mr Johnson.
And speaking at his party's spring conference, Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey called for a full public inquiry into the PM's decision to give Lord Lebedev a peerage. 
He told party members: ""The cosy relationship between Putin's oligarchs and the Conservative political elite has been the dirty secret of the British establishment for far too long.""
I’m not a UK security risk, Russian-born peer says
Johnson denies intervening over Lebedev peerage
Who are the mega-rich Russians facing sanctions?
Lord Lebedev was given his peerage in July 2020.
He has denied posing a ""security risk"" to the UK, writing an article in the Evening Standard newspaper - which he owns - saying: ""I am not some agent of Russia.""
The son of billionaire Russian banker and former KGB officer Alexander Lebedev, who moved to the UK as a child, has condemned President's Putin's actions in his newspaper, writing: ""I plead with you to stop Russians killing their Ukrainian brothers and sisters.""
And he has warned it is ""crucial we do not descend into Russophobia"" during the war in Ukraine.
Newspaper claims
An article in the Sunday Times last week claimed security services withdrew their assessment that giving the honour to Lord Lebedev posed a security risk after the PM got involved.
The newspaper said that in March 2020, the commission that vets peerage appointments advised the prime minister against granting the newspaper owner a seat in the House of Lords, due to security concerns.
But Mr Johnson, who ultimately decides who gets a peerage, is said to have responded to the advice by claiming it was ""anti-Russianism"".
The PM denied the report, saying it would ""obviously be extraordinary"" if he had intervened, ""but that's not the case"".
But in another Sunday Times article, the newspaper claimed the head of MI6 had held concerns about the businessman for as long as a decade.
Boris Johnson - pictured here with Lord Lebedev in 2009 - denied he intervened over security concerns with the peer
Asked on the BBC's Sunday Morning programme about the reports, Levelling Up Secretary Mr Gove said he was ""not aware of any of the concerns that had been expressed until they appeared in the newspapers"". 
He added: ""Of course there are questions that are going to be asked, but no one has ever said to me that there are any specific security concerns that they have about Lord Lebedev.""
The government minister also pointed to the fact Lord Lebedev was a British citizen, adding: ""I think it is important to draw a distinction between Evgeny Lebedev's father, who obviously... worked for the KGB, and Lord Lebedev himself, who is someone who has made his home in this country.
""There is a distinction to be drawn between the actions of parents and the actions of children.""
But Labour leader Sir Keir has written to the chair of House of Lords Appointment Commission, Lord Bew, asking for vetting information to be made public, and for him to ""commit to a review of the propriety of Lord Lebedev's place in the House of Lords"". 
Speaking to Sky News' Sophy Ridge, he said: ""I think the prime minister has got serious questions to answer. What did he know? And did he override security advice?
""Let's have a process to look into what actually happened, what did the prime minister know and what did he do in response to that. I think that is the least we are entitled to in relation to this appointment.""

The Kurdistan Regional Government said the ""cowardly"" attack targeted civilian locations in Irbil
Iran's Revolutionary Guards force says it targeted an Israeli ""strategic centre"" with missiles that struck the Iraqi Kurdish city of Irbil overnight.
Twelve missiles hit areas around the US consulate overnight, causing material damage and wounding one civilian, the Kurdistan Regional Government said.
The US said no Americans were hurt and that its facilities were not damaged in what it called the ""outrageous attack"".
Israel's military and government declined to comment on Iran's claim.
But Kurdish officials accused the Revolutionary Guards of seeking to use ""baseless"" propaganda to justify targeting civilian locations.
Taxi driver Ziryan Wazir said he was in his car near the US consulate when the missiles struck at around 01:00 on Sunday (23:00 GMT on Saturday).
""I saw a lot of dust, then I heard a very loud noise. The windows of my car exploded and I was injured in the face,"" he told AFP news agency.
A local television channel, Kurdistan24, posted images of damage to its offices caused by the blasts.

Iranian state media cited a Revolutionary Guards statement as saying the force had targeted ""the Zionists' strategic centre of plotting and evil"" in Irbil with precision-guided missiles in response to ""recent crimes"". 
The Revolutionary Guards had vowed to make Israel ""pay"" for an air strike near the Syrian capital Damascus on Monday that killed two senior Iranian officers.
The Kurdistan Region's Council of Ministers said: ""This cowardly attack on Irbil... allegedly under the pretext of hitting an Israeli base near the US Consulate in Irbil, targeted civilian locations and its justification is only to hide the disgracefulness of such offence.""
""We reiterate that the propaganda of the perpetrators of this attack is far from true.""
Iraqi Prime Minister Mustafa Kadhimi also condemned the attack.
""The aggression which targeted the dear city of Irbil and spread fear amongst its inhabitants is an attack on the security of our people,"" he tweeted. 
""Our security forces will investigate and stand firm against any threats towards our people.""
The US ambassador to Iraq, Matthew Tueller, said that Iran ""must be held accountable for this flagrant violation of Iraqi sovereignty and for terrorist attacks on innocent civilian properties"".

384,384,Chelsea 1-0 Newcastle United: Kai Havertz's late goal gives hosts three points,"Sun, 13 Mar 2022 16:42:12 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/60635693,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/60635693?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,Chelsea snatch a dramatic late winner to beat Newcastle in the first game at Stamford Bridge since Blues' Russian owner Roman Abramovich was sanctioned by the UK government.,"Chelsea 1-0 Newcastle United: Kai Havertz's late goal gives hosts three points
Kai Havertz has scored in three consecutive Premier League appearances for the first time, and in all competitions he has had a hand in six goals in his last five games (five goals, one assist)
Chelsea snatched a dramatic winner against Newcastle in the first game at Stamford Bridge since Blues' Russian owner Roman Abramovich was sanctioned by the UK government.
The game looked to be heading towards a goalless draw before Kai Havertz expertly controlled a ball forward and fired into the net in the 88th minute.
It was a tough goal to concede for Newcastle who had wanted Havertz to be sent off in the first half for catching Dan Burn in the face with an elbow when jumping, but the German only received a booking.
Before the goal, both sides had struggled to create clear-cut chances, with Chelsea taking 75 minutes to produce an effort on target.
Newcastle's Miguel Almiron had earlier forced a fine save from home goalkeeper Edouard Mendy with a well-struck 25-yard volley and Burn headed just wide.
Just as had happened in Chelsea's 3-1 away win over Norwich on Thursday, a small section of fans chanted Abramovich's name, for a brief period in the second half.
Abramovich has been sanctioned as a part of the government's response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, meaning his assets, including Chelsea Football Club, have been frozen.

Chelsea 1-0 Newcastle: Thomas Tuchel praises Kai Havertz's 'rare quality'
Chelsea stay third, but are now only seven points behind second-placed Liverpool and 10 adrift of leaders Manchester City. Meanwhile, Newcastle, beaten for the first time in nine Premier League matches, are 14th, 10 points clear of the relegation zone.
The relief and delight shown from Chelsea boss Thomas Tuchel, both at the goal and again at the final whistle, showed what this meant to him by screaming at the fans and punching the air.
And it was easy to see why he was so emotional with the club's very existence potentially under threat.
Abramovich has been the Chelsea owner for nearly 19 years, a period in which they have won 21 trophies, including the Premier League on five occasions and the Champions League twice.
But the current sanctions against him have stopped him selling Chelsea, and mean the club are unable to buy or sell players, cannot sell any more tickets for games, have had their credit cards suspended and have had to close the club shop.
The government said it would issue a special licence that allowed fixtures to be fulfilled, staff to be paid and existing ticket holders to attend matches, although the club's wage bill stands at £28m a month.
It seemed fitting that Newcastle, another side with hugely controversial owners following their takeover in October by the Saudi Arabian-backed Public Investment Fund (PIF), were Chelsea's opponents on a day when events off the field were talked about as much as those on it.
Newcastle's takeover and the potential huge investment into the club was celebrated by their fans a few months ago, although Amnesty International said ""it represented a clear attempt by the Saudi authorities to sportswash their appalling human rights record with the glamour of top-flight football"".
Plenty of positives for Newcastle

Chelsea 1-0 Newcastle: Eddie Howe 'disappointed' to lose unbeaten run
Despite the late defeat, this was another sign of the progress Newcastle are making on the pitch. There was plenty for Newcastle boss Eddie Howe to be positive about given his side were only a few minutes away from securing a point away at the current European and world champions.
Arriving at a club without a league win and with only six points from 12 matches, he began with five defeats in his first eight games in all competitions, including a humiliating home loss to third-tier Cambridge United in the FA Cup third round.
But, after spending £80m in the January transfer window, the Magpies had been on a run of eight games unbeaten, including six victories, before this narrow loss.
The visitors had defended superbly up until Jorginho's excellent ball over the defence found Havertz, who showed his class to control it and then score the winner to delight the packed crowd at Stamford Bridge.
Howe said he thought Havertz could have been sent off but was also disappointed his side did not get a second-half penalty when Trevoh Chalobah had a hold of Jacob Murphy's shirt.
Newcastle wanted Chelsea's Kai Havertz to be sent off for elbowing Dan Burn, but Havertz only received a yellow card after a check by the video assistant referee

Fewer people are commuting to work even after work-from-home guidance was lifted
Jobs on the railways ""will need to change to become more passenger-centric"", according to the group that represents train operators.
The Rail Delivery Group (RDG) was responding to reports that hundreds of rail ticket offices could potentially close as part of a plan to modernise the railways. 
RDG said it is talking to unions about how to address job changes. 
One union said it will ballot staff if compulsory redundancies are used.
A spokesperson for the RDG, which represents the rail industry, said: ""The pandemic has been an unprecedented financial shock to the railway. 
""While no decisions have been taken over ticket offices, with the acceleration of changing travel patterns and more passengers migrating to digital technology, many jobs will need to change to become more passenger-centric. 
""Train companies are working with unions on how to address those changes, while making sure the industry takes no more than its fair share from the taxpayer,"" they added.
The bosses of rail operators are in talks with the government about the closures, which may result in redundancies if staff cannot be moved into other roles, the Sunday Times reported, external.
During the pandemic, train passenger numbers collapsed and so did revenues.

Mayors call on government to reassess rail plans
Passengers numbers are still recovering, with big changes such as hybrid working affecting commuter levels and season ticket sales. 
To ensure the railways kept running during the pandemic, the government stepped in to finance the industry. 
Recently, rail minister Wendy Morton told the BBC that taxpayers had supported the railways with more than £14bn of funding, and that taxpayers had to get a good return on what they had invested. 
As part of plans to modernise the railways, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps committed to modernising ticketing with more digitisation, as part of the Williams-Shapps plan for rail. 
Train tickets purchased online can be collected at self-service kiosks in train stations
'Daft' plan
Manuel Cortes, TSSA general secretary, said: ""Grant Shapps needs to realise that this daft plan is likely to result in the threat of compulsory redundancies, and if that happens we will be issuing ballots for industrial action.
""Closing ticket offices will not only be opposed by the unions but the public at large. 
""Shapps must stand up to the faceless accountants in the Treasury because a properly run and fully functioning railway is vital in building an economic recovery from Covid.  
""The government should share their plans in detail with us and commuters now if they are so sure that closing ticket offices and taking £2bn a year out of our railways is the best way forward.  
""I'd strongly urge them to reconsider,"" Mr Cortes added.
Railway ticket offices are run by train operating companies in different stations, and not by Network Rail.

He wears it well: Sir Rod Stewart was pictured in a high-vis vest, shovelling gravel
A council has urged people not to try to repair potholes themselves after Sir Rod Stewart was filmed doing it.
Instagram videos showed the singer, 77, shovelling gravel near his home near Harlow, Essex, claiming drivers were ""bashing their cars up"" on the road.
His post was liked more than 75,000 times in a day and prompted comments praising his actions.
An Essex County Council cabinet member warned anyone attempting to repair a road could become liable for accidents.
Lee Scott, who is responsible for highways maintenance at the authority, said: ""You can't take matters into your own hands.
""People must always report potholes to the council and we will fix anything that's dangerous.""
The rural road near Harlow in Essex has many potholes
In the Instagram post, external, Sir Rod claimed the road had been in need of repair ""for ages"" but that ""no-one can be bothered to do it"".
Dressed in a tracksuit and high-vis vest, he explained why he and ""the boys"" decided to fix it themselves.
""People are bashing their cars up. The other day, there was an ambulance with a burst tyre. My Ferrari can't go through here at all,"" he said.
Mr Scott promised he would ""endeavour to rectify it"" and asked for an officer report as quickly as possible.
He said: ""All road repairs have to be done to a professional level or the person doing it could become liable for any problems or accidents"".
He added he would be happy to arrange a meeting with the singer to discuss the issue.
The BBC has approached Sir Rod for comment.
The 77-year-old is seen singing and shovelling gravel near Harlow in Essex
Dominic Zarian from the area spent about £130 on car repairs after being unable to avoid ""a massive crack"" in the road, which he says he reported to the council four weeks ago.
He said: ""That road is dark, when it's wet it can be treacherous. Someone's going to get hurt.""
Essex County Council's pothole webpage, external said all reports were inspected but ""the timescale for the repair depends on the risk assessment and which type of road the pothole is on"".

Why is it being bombed so heavily?","Zhytomyr: Aerial attacks hit city that is corridor to Kyiv
Intense daily bombing has left many of Zhytomyr's residents homeless
Since the start of the invasion, most of the world's attention has focused on Russian attacks on the east and the south of Ukraine, as well as the areas around Kyiv. 
But just west of the capital, in the Zhytomyr region, residents have faced massive daily bombardment - killing civilians and leaving many without homes.
In the first two weeks of the invasion, Russians have launched over 40 rocket and air attacks on the city of Zhytomyr itself and surrounding towns and villages. 
Dozens of people have been killed, both troops and civilians. So why is Russia attacking this part of Ukraine so heavily?
Logistics hub
The city, which had a population of about 280,000 before the war, is a key point in the logistical and humanitarian corridor, Zhytomyr's mayor Serhiy Sukhomlyn tells the BBC. Aid from Europe is being delivered to Kyiv and further east via Zhytomyr, and refugees are travelling in the opposite direction.
""In order to intimidate Zhytomyr, they are hitting both residential and industrial buildings, targeting infrastructure,"" says Mr Sukhomlyn.
As a result of bombing, water and gas supplies have been hit. But the mayor says local services are managing to mend a lot of the damage, ensuring most of the city has water and heat. Mr Sukhomlyn says the city also has a reserve source of water which will be used at this time of emergency.
The constant attacks on the city forced many to flee, either to western Ukraine or other countries. But at the same time, the Zhytomyr region itself has been sheltering evacuees from regions further east. Many are now using it as a transit point before evacuating further.
Zhytomyr has also become a hub for attempts to deliver aid to the towns and villages to the north-west of Kyiv, which have been hard-hit - and in some cases completely destroyed - by the fighting.
Russian invading forces put maximum effort into cutting off roads between Kyiv and Zhytomyr. While the city and surrounding areas are heavily bombed, ground fighting is still around 60km to the east, on the outskirts of Kyiv.
'The ground shook'
But the bombings are taking a heavy toll on Zhytomyr's population. 
One resident, Nina, says during the first week of fighting, her street - mostly made up of single-storey private homes - was entirely destroyed. Three of her neighbours were killed and dozens more were injured. A local hospital was also bombed which meant the amount of medical help which could be provided was limited.
""It sounded like the plane was very low, nearly touching us,"" Nina tells the BBC. ""The ground was shaking. How could they not see they are bombing residential areas?"" 
There is a military base in the Zhytomyr region which could have been a target for a Russian attack but it is a long way from her destroyed home.
As soon as she heard the air raid warning siren, Nina ran with her children to a neighbour's house and managed to hide in their basement.

Since the invasion began, much of Zhytomyr's key infrastructure - including this school building - has been destroyed
But her neighbours - a mother with three children - did not manage to get to the shelter in time. 
""The mother is in a bad state - her head and stomach were hit by flying glass, she has shards in her lungs.""
After suffering a bad leg injury, Nina's daughter's boyfriend has had to have a metal plate fitted into his knee.
Nina has since left Zhytomyr and is heading to Poland. She can't stop crying: ""Our only hope is now in God"", she says. Her daughter is choosing to stay in Ukraine with her boyfriend.
What will happen next?
Zhytomyr and the surrounding region have been bracing themselves for a possible direct attack from Belarus. 
For a few days there were reports that a ground offensive was a distinct possibility. The Belarusian president Alexander Lukashenko claimed, without evidence, Ukraine was getting ready to attack his country.
Even though Zhytomyr mayor Serhiy Sukhomlyn says he has no time for Mr Lukashenko's accusations, he stresses that the city is well-protected against a ground offensive.

For him more pressing tasks are at hand. 
The city is constantly repairing water and energy supply lines to make sure that those who remain here - about half of the population, according to the mayor's estimates - can continue living in Zhytomyr.

Videos of actors from a Ukrainian film shot in 2020 have gone viral on Facebook and TikTok - with people falsely claiming that attacks in the country are being 'staged'
Russia's invasion of Ukraine has triggered a wave of falsehoods on social media and the airwaves. In a new Radio 4 podcast series, War on Truth, our specialist reporter follows the stories of people caught up by misinformation - and gives some tips about how to avoid it. 
Since the war began, my inbox has been flooded with messages from people telling me about misleading videos on their social media feeds and troll accounts promoting conspiracy theories. 
And it's not just on social media - it's also state-sponsored propaganda pushing false claims on air and beyond. 
In a new podcast series, I'll be reporting on the information battle being waged over Ukraine - and hearing from the ordinary people sucked into it. 
How can you spot bad information - and stop its spread? 
1. Watch out for old and misleading videos
There are very real, distressing videos being shared of what's happening on the ground in Ukraine. But there is also footage from old conflicts going viral. Often people share it because they're shocked - or even trying to help. But it's just adding to the chaos for those in the country.
This footage was portrayed as being from the conflict in Ukraine - but was actually shot in Syria
The best way to figure out if a video is real or not is to look for clues - like the weather, the road signs, the languages people are speaking. 
Videos of Russia's invasion of Crimea and from the blast in Beirut in 2020 have been shared widely, pretending to be from the current conflict. 
Using Google Maps, you can figure out if the video is really from where it claims to be. And by using reverse image searches - available from a number of websites - you can see if that same video or image has been shared online before. That's a tell tale sign that it's been recycled from a previous event. 
Newsround: How to tell what's fake and what's real
False claims the war is a hoax go viral
2. Who is sharing it - and why? 
It's important to examine who shared a post in the first place. Can you verify who they are - and are they a trusted source?
Those who have posted misleading videos are sometimes looking for likes and shares. It's a distressing time - and posts about what's happening in Ukraine are likely to catch on. Others are sharing false claims to push certain narratives - to boost their political agendas or to sow doubt and confusion.
Several young people in the country have told me about pro-Russia accounts which argue with Ukrainians, suggesting without any proof that the war is ""staged"" or Ukraine is bombing its own territory. 
Ukraine invasion: Misleading claims continue to go viral
How you can stop bad information from going viral
How to verify videos
One man I interviewed explained to me that even pictures of his home near Kyiv totally destroyed by bombs couldn't convince these trolls. Many of them have few or no followers, have taken their profile image from other places online and use generic usernames. They also only started to post after the invasion began. It's hard to tell who ultimately is running these accounts. 
Other accounts that have promoted false claims about the Covid pandemic have turned their attention to sharing false conspiracy theories about the war. The same false tropes - for instance that those injured by bombing are ""actors"" - have come up again and again, and have even been pushed by Russian diplomats.

3. Pause before you share 
A lot of what's on social media about the war is frightening. It triggers a reaction - and that means people sometimes share posts before checking if they're real. Disinformation spreads because it plays on our emotions and our biases. 
Steven Seagal is not fighting in the war - this is fake tweet made to look like it was sent out by CNN
It's not just about negative emotions - sometimes hopeful stories can also go viral. While they may boost morale, they contribute to the chaos online and make it harder to figure out what's actually happening. 
The information war is about more than social media. It's a battle fought by governments in both Ukraine and Russia, which are pushing out propaganda. Question why a particular source might be saying something - and whether it's backed up by evidence.

A group of children including toddlers and teenagers take part in a karate class for new arrivals in eastern Poland
The kicks are high and the punches straight, but the Ukrainian children here are delivering them in an environment of peace: a karate class for new arrivals in eastern Poland. 
The 14 students are given the basic moves by a Polish teacher, who ensures there's plenty of laughter. For this hour at least, the trauma they've gone through in the past fortnight is replaced by enjoyment.
Some of them have family back at home fighting for real. Fourteen-year-old Dariy Gulyk hasn't heard from his father for three days and is worried. The emotions make it hard to feel settled here.
""In Poland, it's very cool"", he says, ""but we want to go home - because home is home.""
His cousin, Sasha Minaiev, 17, appreciates the temporary distraction.
""When we're in the karate class, we forget about the war in that moment"", he says, ""but when it ends, we remember again, and we understand we must do all we can to help our people in Ukraine.""
The old centre of Zamosc is a Unesco World Heritage site
The class takes place in the small eastern Polish town of Zamosc, population 60,000. Its beautiful old centre, a Unesco World Heritage site, is dotted with Renaissance churches and coloured facades: a far cry from the horror unfolding across the border.
It, like many others across Poland, has been transformed in the past two weeks into a refugee hub. On some days, up to 35,000 people have arrived - most going on further west but some staying. Around a thousand beds have been provided at the reception centre, schools, private homes and even the sports club where the karate class takes place.
'Left alone'
The mayor, Andrzej Wnuk, says it's a huge strain on Zamosc, warning that the welcome has its limits.
""Polish people seem infinitely ready to give, but it will end one day"", he says. ""We thought there would be a first wave of refugees and then we would get significant support from the government and the EU but it turns out we were left alone. We need financial help or the quality of our hospitality will drop drastically.""
The impulse in Zamosc to offer refuge is partly due to its history as a place that has known the cost of oppression. Almost half of its pre-war population, some 12,000 people, were Jews. During occupation first by the Soviets and then the Nazis, most were sent to the ghetto here and then to concentration camps. A monument to the tragedy, made from the headstones in the town's old Jewish cemetery, stands on the outskirts.
The locals here are proud of their heritage of hospitality, extended to the new arrivals. The restaurant at the Renesans hotel is now only cooking for refugees. In the kitchen, pots of Ukrainian beetroot soup and fruit compote bubble away, as staff box up portions of pork ribs and pasta.
The owner, Damian Poterucha, says as a father, it was a natural decision to change his business once he saw the children fleeing the war.
""I can't believe Polish people are responding like this"", he says, ""it's nice to see.""
But he says he's running short of money and can only continue offering the handouts for another two weeks. ""After that, I will think about what I can do next"", he adds.
Damian Poterucha now uses his hotel kitchen to prepare food for refugees
'Help from the world'
The food is delivered to the main shelter, where some 300 volunteers help out. All the while, buses arrive with new arrivals - and others leave, taking those on board to larger cities in the west, where many of the refugees have friends or family.
""We need help from the world"", says Barbara Godziszewska, a town hall employee now helping to serve hot food. ""Everybody looks at us and gives us a 'bravo', but it's too small - someone needs to tell us what we can do with the refugees. If the numbers continue like this, I'm afraid maybe they'll go on the street to sleep because every hotel is full.""
In the space of a fortnight, Poland has gone from rejecting migrants from the Middle East to opening its arms to those from Ukraine. There is discomfort among some Poles with what appears to be a volte-face by their government, from pushing away the mainly Muslim men of Syria to welcoming the predominantly white, Christian women and children of Ukraine. 
But Poland's migration policy will be pored over by historians in future years. For now, the focus is on the present influx. And as the fighting worsens in Ukraine - and begins to spread to the west - towns like Zamosc are wondering how long they can cope.

On day 18 of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, a military training base in the western city of Yavoriv was struck by a barrage of cruise missiles. 
At least 35 people were killed and 134 injured in the deadly attack at the facility, near a major crossing point into Nato member Poland. 
Video of the aftermath of the attack posted online and verified by the BBC showed a huge crater at the site and smoke billowing from a fire at a nearby building.
Witnesses told the BBC how ""the night sky turned red"", sparking fears that the conflict would soon spread to the up-to-now peaceful regions in the west. 
US journalist killed 
Fighting continued in areas outside the capital Kyiv, and a US journalist was shot dead in the town of Irpin. 
Brent Renaud, 50, was a journalist and filmmaker who had previously worked for the New York Times, though he was not on assignment for the publication in Ukraine.
Kyiv's police chief Andriy Nebytov said he had been targeted by Russian soldiers. Two other journalists were injured and taken to hospital.
It is the first reported death of a foreign journalist covering the war in Ukraine.
Brent Renaud won a Peabody Award for his journalism in 2015
Teenage army recruits
Inside the capital, the BBC's Jeremy Bowen spoke with teenagers who had volunteered at a centre in Kyiv to fight for Ukraine.
Most of them were in their late teens, not long out of school. They told our correspondent that after three days' basic training they would head for the front line - or very close to it. Some of them were wearing knee pads that looked too small. A few had sleeping bags. One had a yoga mat.
""I feel a bit scared, as no-one wants to die, even if it's for your country. So, death is not an option for us"", 18-year-old Dmytro told him.

UK refugee scheme 
In the UK, the housing secretary announced the details of a scheme designed to accommodate Ukrainian refugees. 
Under the Homes for Ukraine plan, people will be able to nominate a named individual or a family to stay with them rent-free, or in another property, for at least six months. A website to express an interest in being a sponsor will launch on Monday. Ukrainians on the scheme will be given leave to remain for three years, with the right to work and access public services. Sponsors would get a ""thank you"" payment of £350 a month.
Critics of the plan say it falls short of what is needed. 
On the red carpet, the actor Benedict Cumberbatch hinted that he hoped to take in a refugee.
""What we all have to do is continue to put pressure on our politicians as far as the refugee crisis goes, continue to put pressure on the Putin regime, continue to help in any which way we can - whether that's through donations or housing refugees, all of which I'm looking to do - and have done"", he said. 
Benedict Cumberbatch, pictured with wife Sophie Hunter, wore a blue and yellow badge
Russian brain drain 
According to one estimate by a Russian economist, as many as 200,000 Russians have left their country since the start of the war.
The EU, US, UK and Canada have closed their airspace to Russian flights, so they are heading for countries where flights are still permitted and where visas are not required, such as Turkey, Central Asia and the South Caucasus. Many have fled to Armenia.
The BBC's Rayhan Demytrie spoke to Russians who have arrived in neighbouring Georgia. Many can be seen wandering around the capital Tblisi, with their suitcases and often their pets. 
""I understood the best way to act against Putin's regime would be my emigration from Russia,"" Yevgeny, a 23-year old politics graduate told her. ""It's my responsibility to do anything I can to help the Ukrainians.""

""We have a big house, my kids have left home,"" says John. ""It's not a great hardship for us to make some space for a refugee.""
In 2021, they hosted one person from Ethiopia and one from Iran, each for a couple of weeks while they awaited longer-term accommodation during the asylum application process.
And now, he is ready to open his five-bedroom house again.
He says: ""It was the sheer numbers involved that made me want to help. The fact that this is only down the road... means there is even more obligation for us to be hospitable.
""There could be four or five million people looking for places to stay, so the UK has to do its bit and the British people have to do their bit.""
He says the system for Ukrainian refugees will involve a bigger commitment than his Ethiopian and Iranian guests - the government are asking for people to offer a place to stay for at least six months.
But John says hosting refugees can be very rewarding.
""I really enjoy meeting people and talking to people from different cultures,"" he says. ""I just found the experience absolutely fascinating, talking about their country, their experiences, their culture.""
He says his refugee guests wanted to be useful. The Ethiopian made a meal for his hosts to introduce them to his country's cuisine, while the Iranian repeatedly offered to use his professional skills to repair things around the house.
But he advises anyone considering being a host to be ""patient and understanding"" - and to learn as much about their guest as they can, in order to offer them the right kind of environment.
""A lot of refugees will be severely stressed, maybe they even have PTSD,"" John says. 
""Chances are, refugees have had terrible experiences, and you have to know when to give them some space and some peace and quiet, or when they might want companionship.""
Efrem, from Ethiopia, shared his country's cuisine with John and Sue when he stayed with them
He suggests finding out about their interests; whether they want to attend a church or other religious services; whether they have hobbies; or whether they prefer peace and relaxation or keeping busy.
But with the Homes for Ukraine scheme requiring people in the UK to identify a named refugee they can host, John questions how many people who might want to help - but don't have a personal connection with a Ukrainian - could be matched with someone.

On previous occasions John hosted refugees, it was arranged by the charity Refugees At Home, which visited him to check on the accommodation being offered and asked about any house rules.
He then received information about the refugee they hoped to place with him - with details such as their age, country of origin, and whether they spoke English.
John says he is concerned about the lack of a similar system for Ukrainians, with the government suggesting people in the UK could make contact with refugees via social media. ""I am concerned about what support mechanism there will be,"" he says.
Since the Ukraine scheme was announced, John has contacted Refugees at Home, and urges anyone considering opening their doors to see it as an opportunity. 
""It might be challenging,"" he says, ""but it can also be very enriching.""

Watch: Maksym Lutsyk,19 (left) and Dmytro Kisilenko, 18 are at war with three days training.
Just over a week ago I met a group of young men who had volunteered at a centre in Kyiv to fight for Ukraine. 
Most of them were in their late teens, not long out of school. They told me that after three days' basic training they would head for the front line - or very close to it. 
Maksym Lutsyk, a 19-year-old biology student, told me he wasn't fazed about trying to become a soldier after less than a week of instruction. He'd manage, after five years in the Scouts, not just learning backwoods skills, but also some weapons training. He was 10 when Ukraine's long war with separatists sponsored by Moscow started in 2014.
Maksym had gone to join up with his friend Dmytro Kisilenko, 18, who was studying economics at the same university. 
The recruits were like any bunch of young lads who had decided they were no longer boys, laughing too loudly when someone told jokes to hide their nerves, or trying a bit of bravado. 
Some of them were wearing knee pads that looked too small, as if they had come with skateboards on their 12th birthdays. A few had sleeping bags. One had a yoga mat. When they waited outside for the bus that was going to be taking them to the training base, they looked like friends on the way to a festival - apart from the guns. Each had been given custody of a Kalashnikov assault rifle.
Maksym (far left) and Dmytro (centre, with green jacket and white trainers) before their training
I'm in touch with Dmytro and Maksym and the other volunteers. This weekend I went to see them at their posts on the eastern edge of the city, where they have been issued with uniforms, body armour, proper infantry kneepads and helmets. 
A bitter wind blew through the checkpoint which the volunteers were trying to turn into a real obstacle with sandbags and steel tank traps. They made the best of their very basic training.
Dmytro told me: ""I got used to my gun. I learned how to shoot and how to act in the battle, also many other things that will be very crucial in the fight with the Russians."" He laughed, as if he found it hard to imagine what he was contemplating.
Maksym looked more urgent, more serious, less like a laid-back student.   
""I feel much more confident than I was before, because we get enough knowledge in tactics, in martial arts, in tactical medicine and in how to do something on the battlefield."" Only half joking, he wanted to see the Ukrainian flag flying from the Kremlin. 
The question on everyone's mind here is whether the battle is coming for Kyiv.
""It's definitely possible"" said Dmytro. ""We just have to stop them here, because if they get to Kyiv this war might be over.""
Barricades have been set up on roads in Kyiv using concrete blocks and ""tank traps"" from the city's museum
They are from the same town near the Russian border, which is being shelled. Their families are still there. I asked the boys what their parents thought of what they were doing. Maksym joked that his mother had told him to stay in a shelter and volunteer to cook the food. He had spared them the details of his deployment because he didn't want to worry them.
Dmytro's parents knew what he was doing. He had started by volunteering to make Molotov cocktails and after a few days rang his dad to tell him he had decided to join the territorial defence force. His father told him not to try too hard to be a hero. 
My parents, Dmytro said, are proud of what I'm doing. He looked delighted. I asked him if he felt scared of what is ahead.
""Not much, but it is human nature to feel scared, and of course deeply in my soul I feel a bit scared, as no one wants to die, even if it's for your country. So, death is not an option for us."" 
Dmytro and Maksym talked about their dreams for the future, fun with friends, finishing their studies, careers and eventually families. Their parents must be praying that their sons' plans, energy and even their lives are not smashed by the brutal realities of war, like so many in all the other generations of young men who have joined up to fight in Europe's wars.

SANCTIONS: Impact on everyday lives in Russia
EXIT: Russia faces brain drain as thousands flee abroad
IN DEPTH: Full coverage of the conflict
Foreign journalists have no access to the young Russian men only a few miles away on the other side of the front line. Many are believed to be conscripts, who were not told properly what was being planned for them. Wars are mostly fought by young men. 
I have no doubt that many young Russians in the war have hopes as high as Dmytro and Maksym. One difference might be less motivation to fight, though without the chance to report their side properly, it is hard to say with certainty.  
The two young Ukrainian students-turned-soldiers went back to work on the checkpoint. The professional army is a couple of miles ahead, directly facing the Russians. 
But if the Russians come, like all the volunteers, Maksym and Dmytro will be firing out of the trenches they helped dig into the surrounding ground, where boxes of Molotov cocktails are waiting - old bottles filled with petrol and pieces of grated polystyrene and stuffed with a rag to ignite what they hope might even disable a tank. 
If that doesn't work, the Nato military alliance is pouring in thousands of much more sophisticated anti-tank weapons.    
Everyone here in Kyiv is waiting for what is likely to be the key battle of the war, soldiers, civilians in and out of uniform, along with Maksym and Dmytro and the other volunteers who are getting ready to fight with them.

Most papers are preoccupied with the Russian missile attack on a military base close to Ukraine's border with Poland.
""Putin's deadly warning to the West,"" is the Daily Mail's front-page headline. The paper has seen a British intelligence report that says the strike was designed to illustrate Russia's willingness to escalate, should the West continue sending supplies to Ukraine.
Unconfirmed reports in the Times say the site has been used as a storage depot for anti-tank weapons and surface-to-air missiles, sent to bolster Ukraine's forces. 
Fighters from the base returning to Poland after the attack had British, American and Irish accents, according to the Daily Telegraph, external. One describes the bombardment as being like hell on earth.

Several of the papers pick up on claims that Russia has dropped phosphorus bombs on a town in eastern Ukraine, in violation of the Geneva conventions. 
The Daily Mirror says the chemical can burn to the bone, with agony lasting for months. Local officials quoted in the Telegraph say the weapons are causing indescribable suffering. 
There's a distressing account in the Guardian of alleged atrocities, external by Russian soldiers, in villages near Kyiv. 
Witnesses who have fled to the capital describe house-to-house searches and killings, with phones and laptops being confiscated. 
A woman says she saw her husband beaten and shot dead in the street after he approached Russian forces with his hands raised. He had to be buried in the garden, she goes on to say, because the Russians wouldn't allow them to use a graveyard.
The Financial Times, external and the Washington Post, external are among papers to say they've been told by US officials that Russia has requested military equipment from China. 
There are no details on what Moscow has requested but the papers quote senior White House figures as warning Beijing not to try to circumvent sanctions. 
An expert in Chinese defence policy tells the Post that while Russia has sold arms to China, this has never been reciprocated. Any change would be a ""watershed moment.""
Energy policy
The Times reports that Downing Street is backing plans, external for a big expansion in solar-power generation, and for the building of another new nuclear power plant. 
It's part of Boris Johnson's new energy strategy in light of the conflict in Ukraine, the paper explains. 
Under the proposals, to be announced this week, people would be given incentives to install solar panels at home. 
Plans to build a nuclear power plant on Anglesey, which collapsed in 2020, would also be revived. A source tells the Times:  ""It's just the Treasury that needs to be convinced"". 
The Sun looks ahead to Boris Johnson's trip to Saudi Arabia this week, describing it as perhaps the most important foreign visit of his Premiership so far. 
The paper says allies - not least the United States - will be hoping the Prime Minister can convince the kingdom to massively boost oil production, curbing inflation here, and easing the world's reliance on Russian oil. 
The Sun notes what it calls the Saudis' ""hideous war in Yemen"", external - and that they will want something in return. But it says such is the price of diplomacy at a time of world tension.

Lady Gaga (L) and last year's winner Bukky Bakray (R) presented the rising star prize to Lashana Lynch
Dune might have won the most prizes, but The Power of the Dog proved too powerful when it came to the night's top categories at Sunday's Bafta Film Awards.
The Benedict Cumberbatch-starring western took home best film and best director for Jane Campion, standing it in good stead ahead of the Oscars at the end of this month. 
Elsewhere, Rebel Wilson made an assured hosting debut while the likes of Will Smith, Troy Kotsur and Ariana DeBose cemented their status as Oscar frontrunners. 
Here are seven highlights from this year's ceremony, which marked a return to a full-capacity in-person event at the Royal Albert Hall.
1. Rebel Wilson made an impressive debut
Rebel Wilson has starred in films such as Bridesmaids, Pitch Perfect and Hustle
The Baftas are a more serious and formal affair than a lot of other awards shows, and it can be pretty difficult to get a laugh from the audience. 
As a result, a couple of host Rebel Wilson's jokes fell a little flat, but we thought on the whole the Australian comic actress did a fine job, delivering some solid one-liners in her opening monologue. 
""You guys might be like 'why is Rebel Wilson hosting the Baftas, isn't she Australian?' Yeah I come from the bush, but if you think about it, don't we all?""
""Everyone's asking me me why did I lose weight, well clearly it was to get the attention of Robert Pattinson. Just joking, I did not lose weight for a guy, I did it to get more acting roles.""
""Lady Gaga is nominated for House of Gucci. Apparently they all had Italian accents in that film, I didn't notice."" 
""Tom Hiddleston is here but he isn't nominated tonight, he's just here Loki.""
""We wanted to open the show with a Bond number, because Bond is turning 60, and his girlfriends are turning 25.""
""I'm proud to announce the new James Bond will be me. Bond goes to Australia and it'll be called Die Another G'Day.""
""The next award is for best original score. Mine was actually the last time I was here at the Baftas, when I got Idris Elba's phone number.""
2. Ariana DeBose was not ready for the British weather
Ariana DeBose (right) said she and co-star Rachel Zegler were together wearing the colours of the Ukrainian flag
""Next time I think I'll consult the weather report, and perhaps wear a little less fabric?"" the best supporting actress winner told press backstage following a slightly rainy red carpet.
But unknown to many, her stunning Oscar de la Renta dress actually doubled up as a political statement - when put together with that of her West Side Story co-star.
""Did anybody see what Rachel Zegler's wearing? Because the two of us together are standing with Ukraine, like seriously, we are reflecting it in colour,"" she said.
It wasn't the only reference to Russia's invasion of Ukraine at the ceremony. Woody Norman,, external the 13-year-old star of C'Mon C'Mon, and Boiling Point star Stephen Graham, external both wore ribbons on their suits in the colours of Ukrainian flag. Benedict Cumberbatch, meanwhile, wore a blue and yellow badge. 
""It's horrific what we're seeing daily,"" he told BBC News on the red carpet., external ""We all have to continue to put pressure on the Putin regime, continue to help in any way we can, whether that's through donations or housing refugees, all of which I'm looking to do and have done.""
3. There's no question about Questlove's love for bagels
Questlove's group The Roots is the house band on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon in the US
The musician's film Summer of Soul picked up best documentary, but we were mostly just impressed he was awake enough for the Baftas given his gruelling schedule. 
Questlove went from the DGA Awards in Los Angeles on Saturday night to the Baftas in London on Sunday afternoon. Oh, and he also has to be in New York for his regular job on Monday night - his group The Roots are the house band on a US chat show.
""I'm going to go straight to the airport [after the Baftas] and tomorrow I have to be at work at The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon,"" he explained, but added there was one last place he wanted to visit before leaving London.
""Actually, when she was with us, Amy Winehouse introduced me to a spot called Beigel Bake, it's a 24-hour bakery. When we first started our friendship, that's how she would always end my London trips, so I always go there and honour her.""
If you happened to be in Brick Lane late on Sunday night, that really was Questlove you saw buying a rainbow bagel.

4. Troy Kotsur knows how to make the most of stage props
Troy Kotsur is the firm favourite to win best supporting actor at the Oscars on 27 March
The Coda star has become an awards season favourite and stands a strong chance of winning the Oscar for best supporting actor following his Bafta victory.
""I feel like it's a big pay-off for the many years of an extremely tough journey,"" the deaf actor said backstage through an interpreter. ""It was hellish at times, I feel like a survivor.
""At times I slept in the back of my car, I couch surfed, and on the set of A Streetcar Named Desire, I slept on the bed on set because it was just so hard for me to survive back then as a starving actor.""
Kotsur is now getting the most recognition of his career thanks to Coda, which was directed and adapted by Sian Heder.
""It took a long time for Hollywood to accept actors who happen to be deaf. With Coda, it was really the right team, right director, right script,"" he said.
5. Joanna Scanlan scored a surprise win
Joanna Scanlan took home best actress for her performance in After Love
The After Love star snared the best actress Bafta despite the film not being a major player at other awards ceremonies this season.
Scanlan is perhaps best known for her role in the excellent TV political satire The Thick Of It, so could her first Bafta for a movie role mean that she's more likely to concentrate on film projects in future?
""Well film and TV are changing, aren't they? So I guess I'll be changing with it,"" she said.
""Some of those boundaries are collapsing, and the way we tell stories is changing because of the platforms that we're receiving those stories through. So I'm just going to go with that flow, ride that wave.""
6. The James Bond editors are slightly cross with the Oscars
Elliot Graham (L) and Tom Cross won best editing for No Time To Die
You may have heard that the Oscars have controversially decided this year to pre-record eight of their 23 categories, external in an effort to save time during the telecast. 
At the Baftas, best editing winners Elliot Graham and Tom Cross from No Time To Die were asked what they thought of the Academy's decision, which has been unpopular within the film industry.
""I'm glad you asked that. Speaking for myself, I'm not a fan,"" said Cross. ""I think it taints the entire proceeding - it's not what the Academy of Motion Picture, Arts and Sciences is about. 
""I feel lucky to have attended before, and I just think every Academy Awards statue is gold - it's not silver, it's not bronze. All of those nominees deserve to stand up.""
His co-winner Elliot Graham agreed: ""I grew up wanting to be an Academy member, it's that dream come true, and I think it's [messed] up, they need to think about it.""
7. Parasite has opened doors for foreign-language films
Ryusuke Hamaguchi's three-hour film Drive My Car could repeat its Bafta success at the Oscars
After Drive My Car was named best film not in the English language, director Ryusuke Hamaguchi opened his acceptance speech by joking: ""Well that got rid of my jet lag, thank you!""
Explaining more during the press conference backstage, he said: ""I only arrived in this country yesterday, so it's about 5am Japan time right now.""
Following in the footsteps of major recent awards players like Roma, Parasite and Minari, Hamaguchi acknowledged how attitudes towards films with subtitles have changed.
""The thing that makes us feel that is the change and acceptance of these films in the UK and the US,"" he said. ""The influence of Parasite two years ago on this has been huge, and the next generation of Asian films is here ready to go.""
With just a fortnight to go, all eyes will now turn to the Academy Awards on 27 March, which will mark the culmination of awards season.
This year marked the first full-capacity in-person Bafta Film Awards since the pandemic

Women have begun to be elected as camp leaders among Syrian refugee communities in Lebanon, breaking traditional social norms.
Women would normally be expected to stay at home, in conservative Syrian communities, leaving leadership to men.
But in the camps in Lebanon's Bekaa Valley, home to 800,000 displaced Syrians, the turmoil of war has allowed conventions to be challenged.
Hind Al-Hamad and Ashwaq Mohammed are two of the women breaking the mould and serving as role models for the girls in their camps.

400,400,Reproductive coercion: 'I wasn't allowed to take my pill',"Mon, 14 Mar 2022 01:15:17 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/newsbeat-60646285,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/newsbeat-60646285?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,A BBC poll suggests 50% of UK women under 45 have experienced a form of reproductive coercion.,"Reproductive coercion: 'I wasn't allowed to take my pill'
A BBC poll suggests 50% of UK women under 45 have experienced a form of reproductive coercion
Reproductive coercion is a lesser-known type of abuse. It's when someone uses pregnancy, contraception and sex to control a person.
Examples vary, but can include forcing someone to have an abortion they don't want, damaging or hiding contraceptives and pressurising someone not to use condoms.
To find out how common it is, the BBC commissioned a survey of 1,000 UK women aged 18-44 - and found that 50% said they had experienced at least one type of reproductive coercion.
Carried out by Savanta ComRes, external, a third of women who completed the survey said they'd experienced pressure  - and a fifth said they'd been forced - to have sex without contraception.
This is the most common form of reproductive coercion, according to the survey.
Excuses like 'condoms don't fit'
One in ten women surveyed said they'd experienced someone hiding, withholding or even damaging their contraception - like poking holes in a condom on purpose.
One in ten also said they'd experienced someone removing a condom during sex without consent - an act that's often called 'stealthing' - and is classed as rape under UK law. It's also a form of reproductive coercion.
'I didn't know stealthing is rape - until it happened'
TikTok star 'glad' she shared sexual assault story
Carly says this is something that's happened to her.
""I've had instances where I would say stealthing has happened, where there's been that pressure not to use something when I quite clearly said I wouldn't do anything without using [condoms],"" she tells Radio 1 Newsbeat and File on 4.
Carly has experienced pressure not to use condoms from partners and believes it's 'way too common'
Carly believes reproductive coercion is a lot more common than people realise. 
""I know a lot of people that have said their partner would make an excuse that condoms don't fit, or saying 'well that doesn't work for me - it doesn't have the same effect.'"" 
""But taking something off during sex, I think sometimes men don't understand that actually that's not OK.""
So did she think it was wrong at the time?
""I think when you are in that situation, you don't necessarily identify yourself as a victim, you kind of brush it off. It becomes so normalised that people don't take it seriously"".
But there are other, more extreme instances of reproductive coercion, including some where women are kept continuously pregnant by their partner.
'He controlled my whole life'
That's what happened to Maeve*. She met her partner when she was a teenager and got pregnant a few months later.
She says he was a ""charmer"" at first, but it wasn't long before he was controlling her - and her access to the pill.
""I'd go to the GP, and he'd come and wait in the car. I'd get a call to say 'hurry up' when I was in there,"" Maeve says.
As soon as she was back in the car he'd take it from her.
She says he was doing it so she was ""always pregnant"".
Writing about my sexual assault was 'cathartic' 
Why I shared pictures of my assault online
By doing this, Maeve's partner was able to control every aspect of her life - including being able to get a job.
""Every time I said I wanted to go to work or I mentioned getting a job, I wasn't allowed to take my pill,"" she says.
Her partner was also physically, emotionally, and sexually abusive towards her.
Maeve wants health professionals and the authorities to be more aware of this type of abuse, which is a form of coercive control.
The law was changed in 2015 to make coercive control a criminal offence, external in the UK.
'Fed up of seeing this'
Winnie Porter, 28, is a midwife specialising in women's safety at an MSI Reproductive Choices abortion and sexual health clinic, where we spoke to her.
She's very used to seeing women who are being pressured into a termination, or other types of reproductive coercion.
Safeguarding midwife Winnie often sees women who are being pressured into an abortion
""I hear the same things and I hear the same techniques that people are using to try and coerce women into having abortions, into not having abortions, into having contraception that they don't want.""
15% of women in our survey told us they'd experienced pressure to terminate a pregnancy when they didn't want to.
'A very specific type of control'
Like Maeve, Winnie believes reproductive coercion is not well recognised among health professionals 
""I'd say it's almost a bit of a blind spot for a lot of services,"" she says.
""It is so subtle that it almost doesn't appear, you almost don't notice it and it's only through really kind of questioning what's going on in that woman's life when you start to understand that this very specific type of control is happening.""
While we are doing the interview with her at work, she gets a knock on the door. 
There's a woman in the room next to us being pressured by her partner into a termination she doesn't want.
Winnie goes to chat with her and has a meeting with her colleagues. When she returns she explains what's happening.
""We're trying to determine at this point whether she's safe to go home and how she will manage the situation when she gets home. 
""Unfortunately, she's just not sure. Sometimes this is a bit of a fact-finding investigation about, is there anything else we don't know about this situation?  
""Right now, my job is just making decisions about what we do and ensuring that right now she's OK. She's safe.""
'How often will we see this?'
Cases like this stick with Winnie when she leaves work at the end of the day.
""It's a frustration. I think it's probably the best way to describe it… just thinking I've seen it again and what can we do about it and how often are we going to keep seeing this? And when is anything going to change?""
No data is currently recorded by the NHS or Police for reproductive coercion, and it's not something most health professionals routinely ask about either.

Stilton-making has been a way of life in parts of the Midlands for generations
Brexit, Covid, the cost of living crisis and now the Ukraine war have all taken their toll on British producers and retailers. The BBC asked the businesses behind some of our best-loved foods how they have weathered the storm - and what the future holds.
Within a mile-and-a-half of Billy Kevan's Stilton dairy, located amid the gentle wolds and pretty villages of the south Nottinghamshire countryside, lie three of the four farms that supply milk for his cheese.
""Two of them, we can almost see,"" he said.
Stilton-making has been a way of life for these villages for generations, but Mr Kevan fears the upheavals of the past few years, in the shape of Brexit, Covid-19 and the cost of living crisis have put traditional cheesemaking under unprecedented pressures.
Billy Kevan says Brexit has made importing materials and exporting cheese more difficult
""We need things to settle down,"" said Mr Kevan, who is the CEO of Colston Bassett Dairy, in Nottinghamshire - one of just six businesses licensed to produce the cheese.
He said Brexit had made importing materials and exporting cheese more difficult.
""It's difficult and it's on a knife-edge,"" he said. ""Since leaving the European Union, some of the red tape seems unreasonable.
""Not only do we have to get a vet certification for the cows that supply our milk, we also have to clarify whether the cows have been in the UK for a certain period of time.
""Some of our rennet comes from Scandinavia and, since we came out of Europe, we have seen prices go up.""
Price rises mean decreasing sales, Mr Kevan said
Mr Kevan said the cost of transport and raw materials - such as milk - have also taken their toll.
He and other Stilton manufacturers have expressed concern about proposals for new taxes intended to reduce salt.
""You add everything up together and it all goes on the bottom line,"" he said. ""We have had a small price rise and we are looking at another one, but if you do that you reduce sales. You are effectively caught in a catch 22.""
'More people are buying British'
Pork pie makers deny their product was ever under threat from inferior imports
Following Brexit, there were headlines suggesting the Melton Mowbray pork pie was under threat from foreign imports.
But, according to Stephen Hallam, treasurer of the Melton Mowbray Pork Pie Association and brand ambassador for Dickinson and Morris, one of the Leicestershire town's most recognisable pie-makers, such stories were ""scaremongering"".
""They are perishable products with a very low price so they don't get sent around the world,"" he said.
The process and ingredients of a Melton Mowbray pork pie are protected
Previously protected by European law, the pies now fall under the UK Geographical Indication scheme, external which protects the geographic names of registered food, drink and agricultural products.
""It's not an item that's exported so if anything, moving to the British scheme will hold stronger endorsement,"" said Mr Hallam.
Stephen Hallam is positive about the product's future
""It's policed in Britain and it enables members of the public to flag up infringements to Trading Standards who police it.
""It has to be made within a designated geographic area around Melton and contain a certain type of uncured pork, as well as being baked without supports.""
Christmas traditionally sees strong pie sales in Melton Mowbray
Mr Hallam said the pandemic had had a mixed impact on the famous pie.
""Covid stopped people coming through the door. Less footfall meant lower sales,"" he said.
""But the spend went up. It made people aware of what they are eating.
""Online sales also increased during the course of the pandemic.
""The visitors are starting to come back now and Christmas is always big for us.
""In the week before Christmas, we sold 30,000 pies; in a normal week, it's 4,000.""
Melton's British Pie Awards has seen more entries than ever before
Soaring prices across the economy have pushed production costs, Mr Hallam said, but he believes they have also helped people consider how they spend their money.
""We are seeing more people buying British and local,"" he said.
""As belts are tightened, there is a concern about provenance. 
""The price is going up because it's matching the costs - for example, the cost of power to run an oven.
""You can't not put the price up but sales haven't massively dipped.""
'This business has so much history'
Bakewell tarts and puddings are shipped around the world
Duncan Kirk and his wife Fay could have been forgiven for thinking they had been pitched in at the deep end when they bought one of Bakewell's oldest tart shops.
""We took the business over in December 2019,"" Mr Kirk said.
""We closed to do some refurbishment and we managed to open for one weekend before the country went into lockdown.""
But Mr Kirk said the history of the Derbyshire town's tarts and puddings, which have an established place in British food culture, meant the business has proved resilient.
""The business has been here for 120 years,"" he said. ""It has a long history and it's something to be proud of.
""We had some hairy moments but this business has so much history and brand presence; it was always going to be fine.""
The core of the business is its cafe and takeaway
The pandemic also strengthened the business's online presence, as the shop ships Bakewell tarts and puddings - which are made off-site - around the world.
But the core of the business remains dependent on tourism - via its cafe and takeaway trade.
This suffered during the pandemic, although Mr Kirk said the relaxation of restrictions over the summer periods proved invaluable.
""In the summer months, we were open and domestic tourism was really strong,"" he said. ""The pandemic would have been much worse had we been closed.""
A Defra spokesperson said: ""British food and drink, including Stilton cheese, is recognised worldwide for its taste and exceptional quality.
""Both Blue and White Stilton are protected as a Protected Designation of Origin, and their specific methods of production are essential to their identity.
""We are clear in our commitment to support our exceptional British food and drink producers, and protecting and enhancing the nation's health and natural environment for generations to come.""

A persistent cough Julie Smith thought was Covid turned out to be terminal cancer
Thinking she had coronavirus, Julie Smith took four Covid tests because she had been suffering with a persistent cough and had lost her sense of taste.
The grandmother went to her GP after returning from a family holiday to Butlins - but tests showed Julie actually had terminal lung cancer. 
""From 'you're not ill' and then to be diagnosed with all this, I just can't believe it,"" said the 73-year-old.
Doctors now want targeted screening in Wales to catch lung cancer cases early.
Trials show it can reduce deaths by 20% and one leading cancer charity has said Wales was ""lagging far behind England"" because the NHS in England has offered lung health checks, external in some areas since 2019. 
Artificial intelligence finds lung cancer
Woman with incurable cancer had treatment delayed
Longer waiting times put cancer patients at risk
It is being considered by the Welsh government, although lung cancer screening has not been recommended by the UK National Screening Committee.
But consultants in Wales think it could save people like Julie.
'I had nothing wrong apart from a cough'
Julie Smith had numerous tests and scans revealed a mass on her left lung
And if Julie, who stopped smoking in 1989, was in one of those areas in England, she would have been eligible for a scan which might have saved her life.
""We went to Butlins with the family, I went on the big water slide and everything and then the cough started,"" said the grandmother-of-four from Pontypridd, in Rhondda Cynon Taf.
""I had nothing wrong with me apart from a cough and then a couple of weeks later my taste started to go. I'd had all my Covid injections so I thought 'well I'll be alright, but I'll just have Covid'.""
Julie Smith and her granddaughter on the carousel on their family trip
Julie had started to cough in September 2021 after a break in Minehead, but her Covid tests came back clear.
The retired hospital housekeeper went to the doctors after neighbours heard her persistent cough during the night through the walls of their terraced house.
'I've had a lot of tears'
After further scans, Julie's lung cancer was diagnosed - but it had spread to her lymph nodes and bones so treatment to cure it was no longer possible.
""I had a little tear but was in shock,"" Julie said, recalling receiving her diagnoses. 
""My husband was sobbing, as were my son and daughter. But I've had a lot of tears since.""
She added: ""None of us can believe it.""
Julie's husband Jimmy has supported her through her diagnosis
The diagnosis came just four months after her ex-husband, and the father of her two children, had died of lung cancer.
Julie has had chemotherapy, external and is now undergoing immunotherapy, external - treatment which uses the immune system to help fight the cancer - in an effort to prolong her life.
Julie says her taste has been affected, especially when eating sweet things like ice cream
""I worry about the children and how they're all going to cope,"" Julie added. ""It's been so frightening, I just only hope with immunotherapy that I will have a lot longer.""
Other cancers have a better survival rate because they are usually picked up earlier, but often lung cancer symptoms don't develop until the cancer has advanced.
Julie is now backing calls for targeted lung screening in Wales so other families do not have to go through what her family is going through.
""What was frightening is that I had no symptoms,"" she said. ""I had nothing wrong with me except this cough. You just don't know you've got it so screening would be brilliant.""
How dangerous is lung cancer?
Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer death around the world, with 2.1 million people diagnosed in 2020 and 1.8 million deaths.
It is also the biggest cause of cancer deaths in the UK, external, killing more than 35,000 people a year - about a fifth of all UK cancer deaths.
Experts say the most dangerous thing about lung cancer is patients often do not have symptoms until it is too late to be cured.
Source: Cancer Research UK
What are the symptoms of lung cancer? 
There are usually no signs or symptoms in the early stages of lung cancer but they do develop as the condition worsens.
The main symptoms of lung cancer, external include a cough that does not go away after two or three weeks and gets worse, reoccurring chest infections, aches or pain when breathing or coughing and persistent breathlessness and tiredness.
Source: NHS
Screening is available in 23 areas of England to people aged between 55 and 74 who smoke, or have smoked.
One leading cancer charity has criticised the Welsh government for not starting a pilot in Wales already. 
""In Wales, we are yet to get off the ground,"" said Tenovus Cancer Care chief executive Judi Rhys.
""Even though we have the go-ahead for an operational pilot, that's not going to start until later this year. We are lagging far behind England"".
'I owe my life to lung cancer screening'
Jo Shoba said she owed her life to screening after stage one lung cancer was detected during a health check in December 2019 but is now ""cancer-free"".
Jo Shoba had her first grandchild after lung cancer screening ""saved her life""
""I was perfectly fit and healthy with no symptoms whatsoever, so it was very surprising,"" said the 72-year-old from Liverpool who smoked as a teenager.
""I totally owe my life to the screening. My first grandchild is now five months old and that's such a gift."" 
Leading doctors believe effective screening could cut lung cancer deaths by a fifth and a pilot is currently being developed to test how a national rollout could be implemented.
Dr Sinan Eccles is shaping Wales' lung cancer screening programme
""Bowel cancer and breast cancer have screening programmes and they've helped reduce deaths,"" said Sinan Eccles, Wales' clinical lead for developing lung cancer screening.
""We want to start making a dent in those lung cancer deaths in Wales by screening and curing more cases.
""We've had trials in America, and then in Europe, showing a 20% reduction in lung cancer mortality, which, when you're talking about the biggest cancer killer that we've got in Wales, is huge.""
Mr Eccles, a lung cancer consultant in south Wales, wants to start by developing screening pilots in deprived areas of Wales, where lung cancer cases and deaths are higher. 
'Treatments are helping people live longer'
Although lung cancer deaths are high, doctors say developments in treatments can extend the lives of patients.
""We're seeing cancer outcomes now I would never have dreamt of five to 10 years ago,"" said Dr Mick Button, lung cancer lead at Cardiff's Velindre cancer hospital. 
""Some people are on immunotherapy for two years with their lung cancer and at the end of that they may have very little sign of cancer in their body, no symptoms and they can live for a lot longer.""
The Welsh government has said that although lung cancer screening has not been recommended by the UK National Screening Committee, it is ""under consideration"" and a pilot was being developed. 
""We have invested significant sums in diagnostic equipment and are committed to improving cancer outcomes in Wales,"" said a government spokesperson.
""We have also published our plan for recovering NHS services, including cancer care, backed by nearly £250m of additional funding.""

These are surfboards that have a long carbon-fibre rod, or mast, extending downwards from their underside to two underwater wings.
When the speed and momentum of the sea is sufficient, the wings (also made from carbon fibre) are pushed through the water, lifting the surfboard and its rider up into the air.
In turn, many foilboards now have electric-powered propellers built into their masts, giving extra power so they be used when there are no waves. This means that the user can go surfing not just on flat seas, but even on lakes and rivers.
Many hydrofoil surfboards now have built in electric-powered propellers
""Part of what got me into foiling was the fact that there weren't many women doing it,"" says Ms Fores, aged 26. ""Sometimes I catch the guys off guard, because they're like 'oh, there's a girl out here'.
""And then I think it trips them up that I can actually foil. So it's kind of exciting,"" she laughs.
While hydrofoil technology has existed in boating for more than a century, it wasn't until the early 2000s that it started to make its way into surfing. Electric-powered hydrofoil surfboards or 'efoils' then arrived in 2018 when Puerto Rican firm, Lift Hydrofoils released the first that was commercially available.
""Foiling is opening up the realm of what's surfable,"" says Nick Leason, the company's chief executive. 
Our biggest efoil sales, by far, are coming from people who don't live by the ocean. They're like 50-year-old women who live near lakes."" Mr Leason adds that the firm sold more than 4,000 products last year.
Artificial, inland surfing facilities have been around since the late 1960s, , external and to this day the aim for designers is bigger and better waves.
Australian firm, Surf Lakes, is preparing to debut what it says is the biggest thing to hit the sector, literally and metaphorically.
Still in the research and development stage, it has built a large test facility 20km (12 miles) inland from the Queensland coast. In the middle of a 3.6 hectare (nine-acre) man-made pool, a 1,400-ton, compressed air, steel pump goes up and down every six seconds. Powered by electricity, the pump creates 360-degree waves up to 8ft (2.4m) high, at a rate of 2,000 per hour.
Surf Lakes aims to replicate its Australian test facility, pictured, at numerous locations around the world
""Imagine your best surfing session ever, on endless repeat,"" says Aaron Trevis, Surf Lakes' founder and chief executive.
He adds that there are five rings of waves in the pool at any moment, which vary in shape as they hit different parts of the lake. ""So you can have a whole family with different surfing levels all surfing together at the same time."" 
Although the company has yet to open a facility to the public, it says it now has 20 projects in development across Australia, Asia, Europe and the US. Its biggest sites will allow 200 people to surf at the same time.
""The real market is the 99% of people in the world who have never surfed,"" says Mr Trevis. ""In the next 10 years surfing could be 10 times the size the industry it is now.""
He adds that Surf Lakes' system could theoretically make 15ft waves for professional surfing competitions. 
Surf Lakes says its facilities can create 2,000 waves per hour
Back out in the ocean, Maya Reis Gabeira from Brazil, holds the record for the highest wave successfully surfed by a woman. This was back in February 2020 when she conquered one 22.4m (73ft) high in Nazaré, Portugal.
""There's so much improvement with the help of technology,"" says the 34-year-old. ""Like measuring the height of waves scientifically, in real time, for world record prospects.
""And communication is also now becoming much more sophisticated between people in the water [on jet skis] and on the cliffs,"" she adds, in regard to the crews on standby to rescue professional surfers that get into difficulties.

For surfers with environmental concerns, the fact that the majority of surfboards are still made from polyurethane, a type of plastic, is problematic. 
A small start-up French company called Wyye, says one of the solutions is 3D-printing surfboards using bio-plastics which are made from corn starch.
New Tech Economy is a series exploring how technological innovation is set to shape the new emerging economic landscape.
Founded two years ago by friends, Sylvain Fleury and Leo Bouffier, Wyye now has eight employees, and four 3D printers running day and night at its base near Biarritz in south west France. The firm makes the boards according to each surfer's size, weight and requirements, and ships them across Europe.
In the future it wants to set up other manufacturing facilities overseas, each near key surfing locations. 
""The goal is to duplicate our micro-factory model and 3D-print boards near popular surf spots around the world,"" says Leo Kerhir, Wyve's head of international business development.
He adds that it currently takes an average of 20-50 hours to print a single board. ""But 3D printing technology is improving super fast. Now it's a two-week process from order to delivery, which is the same as a regular custom surfboard. And I think we can reduce that very soon."" 
Leo Bouffier, left and Sylvain Fleury plan to set up production facilities near surfing hotspots around the world
While shark attacks around the world remain thankfully rare, with a global average of 72 a year, , external they do worry many surfers. 
Nathan Garrison is one such person, after a childhood friend from his hometown Charleston, South Carolina, was attacked when he was a teenager. And then years later a neighbour of his in California was killed by a great white shark.
To help prevent attacks, Mr Garrison launched a product called Sharkbanz, back in 2014. It is a small device that a surfer can wear on his or her wrist or ankle.
It uses magnets to create an electromagnetic field of about 6ft that interferes with the electric field senses that a shark uses to hunt and navigate.
The Sharkbanz tag is bought by up to 30,000 surfers per year
""It's kind of like [the human equivalent of] looking at the sun with your eyes, or shining a bright light in someone's face,"" says Mr Garrison. ""It's unpleasant for the shark and makes it want to turn away."" 
Although he now sells up to 30,000 Sharkbanz per year, a report by the Western Australia government found that the technology has a 65% success rate. That is less than two thirds, and in 2016 a surfer in Florida who was wearing the device required 44 stitches after a bite.
""Like any safety device, it's never going to be 100% effective,"" says Mr Garrison. ""Sharks are wild animals. But this has been shown to at least reduce the risk. It tells a shark that you're there, and to look elsewhere for its meal.""

404,404,Deep listening: I realised we all share the same human feelings,"Mon, 14 Mar 2022 00:29:01 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-60558016,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-60558016?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,Hawraa was part of a project which encouraged Lebanese citizens with conflicting views to listen to each other.,"Deep listening: I realised we all share the same human feelings
Hawraa (left) took part in a project for Lebanese citizens which encouraged people with conflicting views to listen to each other
""If a Muslim woman who wore the veil decided to unveil, I used to consider that she is a bad person and didn't deserve to be my friend. If I met her, I would bully her,"" says Hawraa Ibrahim Ghandour, a Lebanese Muslim.
She says her views were shaped by growing up in a very religious family. Her father preferred her to make friends with people who were similar to her, and she says she took those values with her into adulthood and her work as an English teacher at secondary school.
She is one of 150 people in Lebanon who took part in a deep listening project, run by the British Council in partnership with the BBC. The aim was to learn skills of empathy, silence and suspending judgement. And a year on, Hawraa has been reflecting on how it helped open up her mind.
Do you ever really listen?

Deep Listening - A way to better conversations
""I learned to listen more, not to judge but to try and understand, and to give time for the others to communicate the messages that they wanted to. Then to give feedback to check that I really understand what they want me to know.""  
What she sees now as her previous fanaticism and intolerance were extended to anyone who was different.   
 ""I used to be against Syrian refugees in Lebanon,"" she says.""I used to think of Syrians here as not taking care of their hygiene and not living a proper Lebanese life."" 
Hawraa works one afternoon a week at a school for Syrian refugees
However, today she works on Tuesday afternoons at a school for Syrian refugees, despite the stunned reaction from her family. Every morning, Hawraa catches up with Mayada, a refugee nurse from Syria, while she drinks her morning coffee. They first met when Mayada was caring for Hawraa's mother, and now the two women are often in each other's homes. 
Hawraa says her new relationships have helped her become more tolerant. ""In the past, maybe I did not communicate effectively with those people, or maybe I was just listening to the media which plays a role in stigmatising people. If we listen to each other, we find we have many commonalities - human feelings that we share.""
However, Hawraa's friendship with Mayada doesn't prevent Hawraa from having serious hesitations about some aspects of Mayada's culture. Mayada's son is about to marry a woman who is only 16, which is not uncommon in the Syrian refugee community. ""I do accept that this is their choice,"" Hawraa says thoughtfully. ""With deep listening you understand that this person is not your enemy, even if they are behaving differently.""
To celebrate 100 years of the BBC, in May the BBC World Service and the British Council will be running a virtual deep listening training programme for 1,000 young people in 100 countries. 
If you would like to learn listening skills and practice with others from across the globe, you can find out more here, external.
Mohammad, a humanitarian worker from Lebanon, was aware that he wasn't a strong listener, and that this got in the way of negotiations, a critical part of his job. ""I was that person who would always interrupt, the person who would always know what you are trying to tell me,"" he says. ""That's when I jumped in with assumptions, and then tried to validate them. Assumptions can be killers.""
Not long after the training, Mohammad took a job in Mosul in Iraq, working with local authorities, NGOs and UN agencies to create a plan to manage the city's displaced people. To succeed in his new role, Mohammad had to reconcile many different parties with a host of conflicting ideas.
""Should we send displaced people home? Should we try and integrated them in the city where they are? Will they accept living in a neighbourhood with people from a different tribe?"" he says.
Mohammad uses his listening skills in his job helping displaced people in Mosul in Iraq
Mohammad vividly remembers the briefing he received before he started work. As his colleague described the role and its requirements, he started to feel there was background information that he would need but that wasn't being shared.    
""Believe me, in the humanitarian sector, you need to understand the personalities of everyone involved in order to co-ordinate effectively. Who is an enabler, who is a spoiler and who is a blocker."" 
At that moment, Mohammad remembered the listening training and the importance of giving someone space after they finished speaking, both as a sign of respect and to allow them to share more. After his colleague had finished speaking, he waited for a full 20 seconds.   
""In those 20 seconds I was able to gain a bit of trust and bond with her,"" he says. ""After that space our relationship somehow changed, and she shared with me her real experiences and her perception of the key characters I would need to work with.""
Three months on, Mohammad credits this as empowering him to understand how the city works and make huge progress with the plans for a co-ordinated response.
How deep listening works
Ask your speaker to explain their perspective and why they feel so strongly. Listen, without interruption, putting aside judgements, counter-arguments and solutions
Summarise the core of what you have heard and check you have understood correctly, including the emotions and texture of their story. This does not mean you have to agree
Ask whether they agree with your summary. If not, ask them to explain more
Continue with this process till the speaker gives a resounding ""Yes."" They should at this point be likely to listen to your side of the story
There are times, however, when Mohammad tries very hard not to use his newly acquired listening skills.
""In the aid sector, if you get really good, and are in a personal conversation, you take yourself to a very deep emotional level that you may not be prepared for,"" he says.
Mohammad tells me about a conversation with a taxi driver who shared with him his experience of being whipped 18 times for the crime of driving a woman without a male companion, which was forbidden when the city was under the control of the so-called Islamic State. 
""There is a dark side to the deep listening,"" Mohammad explains thoughtfully. ""I know that at this time, it is not safe for me to have these conversations. I need to be able to detach myself from others' experience and suffering. Personally, I am not yet ready to master that emotional side.""
Meanwhile for Hawraa, how does she reconcile her new beliefs with her upbringing and her father's values? Her father died a few years ago, but every Thursday Hawraa visits his grave. ""I feel he can see me from the sky, and I am satisfied that he is happy and proud,"" she says.
""The more we know people, the less we are afraid of them. The less we are prejudiced about them. Maybe he has discovered that all people are the same in their humanity.""

405,405,Rosacea: 'Your skin doesn't define you',"Mon, 14 Mar 2022 00:33:55 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-lincolnshire-60487031,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-lincolnshire-60487031?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,People diagnosed with the skin condition rosacea talk about its impact on their mental health.,"Rosacea: 'Your skin doesn't define you'
Lex Gillies, 37, was diagnosed with rosacea when she was 21
Rosacea is a common but misunderstood condition that is thought to affect millions. It is incurable, and those who have it must often endure a sustained treatment regime, restrictions on what they eat, drink and do and, in some cases, judgements or jibes from others. But a growing community and statements from high-profile sufferers have shown that they are not alone.
Lex Gillies, from York, was a 21-year-old student when she was diagnosed with rosacea.
""I didn't want to do anything that would make people turn and look at me because I didn't want people to notice my skin,"" she says.
The skin condition, characterised by a reddening of the face caused by dilated blood vessels with small bumps and spots, similar to acne, is common.
Some reports suggest as many as one in 10 people in the UK have it.
Controlling its physical appearance, through treatment and managing triggers such as alcohol, spicy food, exercise and even the sun, is one thing. Managing the impact on mental health is another.
Lex, a blogger and British Skin Foundation Ambassador, has spent eight years documenting her relationship with rosacea, and says she has learned to understand and accept her skin as it is rather than treat it ""as my enemy"".
""I'd been seeing my rosacea as this thing that I'd had to battle and overcome and felt my skin was letting me down and being a traitor by allowing it to take over,"" she says.
""But actually it was my skin desperately trying to alert me to the fact something was wrong.""
Rosacea is a common but incurable skin condition which mainly affects facial areas
She has written extensively on the impact rosacea, external can have on people's mental health, saying ""it still isn't something that's taken seriously"".
Her stance made her an unlikely ally - though not on political grounds - of MP Sir Edward Leigh, who has rosacea and recently spoke out about the abuse he receives as a result.
He complained of being labelled a ""red gammon head"" and a ""ruddy-faced buffoon"".
Gainsborough MP Sir Edward, who raised the abuse during a Westminster Hall debate in January, said he had learned to take comments about it ""with a pinch of salt"" but said he was worried about the impact on younger generations and the support available to them.
On this point, Lex agrees, and though Sir Edward has been criticised for some of his political views, including recent remarks about Ukrainian refugees, she says his appearance should not be fuel for taunts.
She has previously pointed out, external how a ""cruel jibe at an MP"" reflects on others who ""take those jokes to heart"".
Sir Edward Leigh MP has called for improved psychological support for people with skin conditions such as rosacea
Janet Doyle, 71, from Hull, was diagnosed with the condition in her 30s and says some days she finds it hard to go outside.
""It's your face at the end of the day. It's what people see first,"" she said.
""It just makes you feel really awful, like, what's the point? It can be really depressing. Sometimes I think about not going out of the door.""
'Skin problems aren't only skin deep' 
MP with skin ailment called 'ruddy-faced buffoon'
Jim Howe, 64, from Skegness, said he had also found it difficult to cope with the unwanted attention his appearance can bring.
He described sitting outside a bar in Spain when a friend turned to him and said 'You've got a face like an alcoholic'.
""People judge you when you've got rosacea, and it can be quite depressing,"" he said.
Nicola Dalby said she had found online support to be a ""lifeline"" for her
Nicola Dalby, from Ayrshire, said she first noticed the condition, which affects her cheeks, nose and forehead, in her teens and had struggled at times, fearing she would never ""grow out of having horrible skin"".
However, she found comfort and support from speaking to others online.
She describes a Facebook community she is part of as being a ""lifeline"" for her in recent years, giving her the opportunity to share experiences and swap advice and, importantly, helping her realise she was not ""on my own"".
Access to professional psychological support for people with skin conditions is something the British Association of Dermatologists says is a ""significant problem"" with big gaps in provision in certain parts of the UK.
It said there was ""a large body of evidence"" demonstrating the impact it could have on a person's mental health and quality of life.
Janet Doyle said her rosacea has meant she has not wanted to leave the house some days
UK charity Changing Faces offers support to anyone living with a scar, mark or condition on their face or body.
Chief executive Heather Blake says too often people's mental health is not taken into account, with the focus being placed on the physical impact of the condition.
She says the charity can offer support for those who may be considering cosmetic procedures and will also provide counselling for those battling the mental impact
""We believe people have the right to choose how they live their life with a visible difference,"" she says.
""Our role is to signpost people to the right support.
""And whilst people with visible differences, like rosacea, continue to experience staring, negative comments and worse, we'll keep campaigning to challenge the discrimination people face because of how they look.""
In January, after Sir Edward raised his concerns about provision, health minister Gillian Keegan said the government was ""committed to achieving parity between mental and physical health services"".
For Lex, after 16 years of living with the condition, she says she is no longer at war with her skin, but acknowledges that ""a lot of people are too early in their journey to understand it or accept it yet"".
""My mantra is your skin doesn't define you. It's something you have to maintain but that is not who you are. You have rosacea, but you are not rosacea.""

406,406,The Muslim women learning to ride a bike in their 40s,"Mon, 14 Mar 2022 06:50:21 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-60710565,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-60710565?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,Hijabi riders is introducing cycling to Muslim women who never learned to ride a bike as a child.,"The Muslim women learning to ride a bike in their 40s
Mahnoor Sultan Campbell learned how to ride a bike at the age of 40
""It's as easy as riding a bike"" goes the old saying. But what if you didn't learn to cycle as a child? 
The humble bike is promoted as a greener form of transport in an age of climate change.
But for some, it come with barriers.
A group in Glasgow calling themselves the Hijabi riders is introducing cycling to Muslim women who may never have laid their palms on a set of handlebars.
Many of them learned to cycle only recently. Their activities include cycling outings and learning to carry out their own repairs.
They have also adapted their clothes to allow them to cycle safely while also being modest. 
The Hijabi Riders started in 2016 and now has 20 women cycling regularly
The cycling group started in 2016 with a handful women but has since grown to 20 members.
Mahnoor Sultan Campbell, one of the originals, said she learned to ride a bike when she was 40 years old, to be able to take her children out.
""I was brought up in Pakistan. So I didn't have a bike as a child,"" she said. ""And my mum believed that girls shouldn't be riding bikes. So once I moved here and settled down, I never even thought about it. 
""It wasn't something that crossed my mind.""
But when her children wanted to go for bike rides, she made it her mission in her 40th year to learn. Wheel forward to now, and Mahnoor is known as the mechanic of the group. 
Mahnoor Sultan Campbell doing a repair on a bike
Her fear of getting a puncture when she first started cycling pushed her to learn basic bicycle repairs.
As she quick-releases a wheel to change the inner tube she laughs, ""I am not the damsel in distress.
""Now I say come on, I'll teach you how to change a puncture so that you do it yourself and you don't have to rely on somebody else.""
Religious barriers
Mahnoor isn't alone in learning late. Rehana Saleem also started in her 40s. 
""I had no idea how to ride a bike before that,"" she said. ""It was just the kids and not having access to a bike… I think I've definitely grown in confidence on the road where before, I would never cycle on the road in traffic at rush hour."" 
She said she loves the travel freedom cycling gives her the most.
Shgufta Anwar, another original member, explains that common barriers preventing women from cycling include safety, lack of confidence, health issues, the cost of buying a bike, as well as religious barriers.
Shgufta Anwar experienced many barriers women face when it comes to cycling
She said: ""I would probably say Muslim women, BAME (black, Asian, and minority ethnic) women, women of colour on top of that they've got religious barriers, they've got cultural barriers, they've got clothing barriers.""
She pulls a large dress tunic from her bag. ""This is called an abaya… it's quite long, it's quite floaty, and there's quite a lot of material that would catch in various bits of the bike and would probably kill you, because you could topple over quite easily."" 
But she has found solutions, including adapting clothes to not only be modest but safe too. She pulls out another item from her pannier, which she's modified herself. ""So it doesn't go all the way to the floor. So it allows me to still cover up. But I can cycle.""
She says being visible on the bike as a Muslim woman encourages other women in her community to know what's possible.
Shgufta has adapted her clothing to make cycling safer
Whilst enjoying cycling together, the women are also passionate about protecting the planet. 
Ms Anwar said: ""In terms of what we're doing to the climate, with our cars, you know, polluting it, not worrying about future generations, destroying the earth. That goes completely against our faith.
""Working on your faith and taking action against climate change, in my opinion are kind of one and the same.""
The women hope to continue breaking these barriers through a business they're setting up, Women on Wheels, which will offer lessons and guided routes with a pay-what-you-can model, so money doesn't become another obstacle.

Chelsea boss Thomas Tuchel said he and his players have a responsibility to fight for everybody at the club after insisting he will stay at Chelsea at least ""until the end of the season"".
In their first home game since owner Roman Abramovich was sanctioned and disqualified as a director of the club, Chelsea snatched a dramatic late win over Newcastle.
On the same day Chelsea Women secured a stoppage-time win over Aston Villa, and boss Emma Hayes said she is not worried about the place of the women's team.
But technical advisor Petr Cech says the club is taking things ""day by day"" amid ongoing restrictions.
After Kai Havertz's 88th-minute winner at Stamford Bridge, Tuchel assured fans he would not leave them in the lurch.
He said: ""There's no doubt I stay until the end of the season. We just have to wait day by day because everything can change.
""This result has a huge impact on us, to give this pleasure to our fans means a lot. It changes everything.
""We are aware how privileged we are. This is a huge club, we are in the focus, but we are very privileged.
""Hundreds of people in this club are not so privileged, maybe face a more existential threat and are more worried about their future than us.
""This gives us a responsibility to fight for them, keep their heads up high and not give in. This is what we can do and this is what they demand from us.""

Chelsea 1-0 Newcastle: Thomas Tuchel praises Kai Havertz's 'rare quality'
Speaking before Sunday's game, former goalkeeper Cech also expressed concerns for staff at the club whose livelihoods are at risk with the future looking uncertain.
He said: ""We have a lot of questions but not many answers.
""We hope the people working for the club will be able to get their salaries and live their lives, and hopefully work. But this is a difficult question for me to answer as I don't know what the licence will be like in days.
""That's why conversations are going on. We would like to know how we operate and what we can do with the team going forward. Without these answers, it's difficult to plan. We go day by day and we need to do it this way at the moment.""
Chelsea's credit card facilities have been temporarily suspended while banks assess the implications of sanctions imposed on Abramovich, but the club has been given a special licence to operate despite the Russian billionaire's assets being frozen.

'Everybody is against us right now'
With uncertainty surrounding all aspects of the club, boss Emma Hayes says she isn't worried that the women's team will be overlooked.
She said: ""I know our place within that club, I know our importance. I don't want any of us to be punished or vilified. At the end of the day Chelsea football club is important to the football community.
""I'm not worried about us, we're a valuable asset to the football club and I know that internally and I don't expect that to change. 
""We have to stick together. Everybody is against us right now. And that is giving us strength; everybody contributed to that win today.""
'There will come a time when people need to embrace change'
Former Chelsea winger Pat Nevin told BBC Radio 5 Live: ""The concern is for the future of Chelsea and that is miles down the list to what is happening to the people of Ukraine.
""I have a feeling Chelsea will survive well but not in the shape it has been for 19 years. Maybe a year down the line Chelsea will be a little bit happier, maybe not winning as many trophies, but maybe a little bit happier.
""I said the league cup final might be the last time I ever see Chelsea in a major final.
""Instead of fearing change, there will come a time when people need to embrace it. The hope for Chelsea fans is to get it done as quickly as possible.
""The reason why clubs fold is always the same: cashflow. That is Chelsea's biggest fear - that needs to get sorted out. Everything else will get sorted out in the end.""

Ukrainian Andriy Yarmolenko emotional after scoring in West Ham win
Ukraine international Andriy Yarmolenko was emotional as he scored the opener against Aston Villa in his first West Ham appearance since the outbreak of war in his native country.
The 32-year-old brought an otherwise disappointing game to life when he controlled Said Benrahma's pass with his right foot before firing past Emiliano Martinez with his left.
Substitute Yarmolenko, who replaced Michail Antonio in the second half, shed tears as he dropped to his knees in celebration.
He was welcomed on to the field with a warm reception from both sets of supporters, and some Aston Villa fans even applauded as he was embraced by his team-mates for the goal.

The Sports Desk podcast: The sports stars on the frontline in Ukraine
Andriy Yarmolenko last scored in the Premier League in July 2020 against Aston Villa
Speaking to Sky Sports, Yarmolenko said he ""tried to give everything on the pitch"".
""It was so emotional for me because of the situation in my country,"" he said. ""It is so difficult for me right now in this moment thinking about football because every day, the Russian army is killing Ukrainian people.
""I just want to say thank you to my team-mates, who support me all the time, every day. To West Ham fans, they also support me and Ukrainian people and also to all British people, because we feel you support us. 
""I felt the support from the fans and I tried to give everything on the pitch because I know how important the game was for us today. I'm not ready for 100% because the last two weeks I train maybe three or four times.
""Since 26 February, I had to rest for four days because it was impossible to train; I was just thinking about my family and my people. I just tried to give everything on the pitch.""
Following the game, Hammers boss David Moyes told the BBC the club had given the striker ""as much time as he needs"".
""His family are safe at the moment, he tells me,"" said Moyes. ""He wants to make sure everybody is fine and he has a lot going on. 
""Sometimes, football is a release and hopefully he has had a bit of a release getting on the pitch again and scoring but there are more important things in life than football.
""The goal is great. He has great technical ability and he is capable of scoring big goals, as he has done for me since I've been here.""

There are more important things in life than football - David Moyes
The Hammers were lifted after taking the lead and Pablo Fornals sealed victory when he powered Benrahma's cutback past Martinez.
Villa arrived in the capital off the back of three impressive wins but they had to settle for a Jacob Ramsey consolation late on.
The visitors were denied taking the lead when Danny Ings' effort was tipped onto the post by Lukasz Fabianski before the ball came harmlessly back to the West Ham goalkeeper.
Victory for the hosts ended a run of three defeats in all competitions and lifted them to fifth in the table, while Villa remain ninth.
Yarmolenko makes the difference 
In a first half with few clear cut chances, Yarmolenko's introduction in the 51st minute sparked the crowd and the game into life.
The Ukraine forward, who featured on the front cover of the match programme, replaced Antonio to a warm ovation and immediately set about linking up his side's play.
Then the moment of brilliance came when he neatly brought down Benrahma's tricky pass before guiding the ball into the far corner in two movements.
Football will have been secondary for Yarmolenko since Russia's invasion of his country and, in that small moment of adulation, he allowed the emotion to spill out.
Having been boosted by the goal, the forward then opted to take on another shot from a tight angle rather than look for the pass, but no-one in the London Stadium was complaining at his choice.

Key moments went against us - Gerrard
Fornals fired the second which put the game out of reach but Villa rallied late on as they tried to wrestle back momentum.
Ramsey smashed Emiliano Buendia's pass into the net with aplomb after the latter had a good opportunity kept out by the impressive Fabianski.
Steven Gerrard will be pleased by his side's intent after going behind as they managed more shots on target (seven) than their hosts (four), but they lacked the clinical edge that has seen them score nine unanswered goals in their last three matches.

409,409,"Garth Crooks' Team of the Week: Ronaldo, Diaz, Eriksen, Yarmolenko, Rudiger","Sun, 13 Mar 2022 21:37:16 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/60730914,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/60730914?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,Who got Garth into trouble at the petrol station? Which striker might be a good buy for Arsenal? Find out in Garth Crooks' latest Team of the Week.,"Garth Crooks' Team of the Week: Ronaldo, Diaz, Eriksen, Yarmolenko, Rudiger
Liverpool shifted pressure back onto Manchester City in the Premier League title race, Cristiano Ronaldo produced a stunning display for Manchester United and Leeds United sealed a massive win down at the bottom.
The weekend provided its usual dramatic twists and turns, though Everton fans may reflect with frustration after a home defeat to Wolves and Burnley's followers will continue to live with relegation worries.
Chelsea managed a gutsy win in testing circumstances, and an emotional Andriy Yarmolenko grabbed the headlines after the Ukrainian struck in West Ham's latest win.
But what you want to know is: who made my Team of the Week? Check it out below and then make your own selections at the bottom of the article.
Goalkeeper - Lukasz Fabianski (West Ham)
Lukasz Fabianski: It was a world class save. The shot came from Danny Ings on the turn and may have had a slight deflection on its way to goal but that didn't seem to deter Fabianski, who pushed what seemed like an impossible stop onto the post before the ball rebounded into his arms. The save set up an extraordinary win for the Hammers on what turned out to be an emotional afternoon for everyone at the London Stadium. Little did we know then that Yarmolenko was destined to steal the show but it was Fabianski who set the whole thing up.
Did you know? Fabianski made six saves for West Ham against Aston Villa. Only against Manchester United - when he made eight - in September has he made more in a Premier League game this season.
Defenders - Joel Matip (Liverpool), Conor Coady (Wolves), Antonio Rudiger (Chelsea)
Joel Matip: It's not often Joel Matip makes my team of the week largely due to his team-mate Virgil van Dijk's outstanding performances. But on this occasion I was compelled to select the former Cameroon international. It started with the ball he played for Luis Diaz to run onto and score his second goal for Liverpool since his arrival. The ball was magnificent. The rest of the defender's performance was consistently high. Matip always seems to be the junior partner when he plays alongside Van Dijk and is often left to do the last-minute blocks and headers off the line while Van Dijk controls the traffic and organises all the other proceedings. Both defenders played well and no heroics were required against Brighton but Matip pipped it for me. 
Did you know? Liverpool have won 73% of the Premier League games in which Matip has featured this season, with the Reds winning 16 of the 22 games when he has played.
Conor Coady: If you're going to score you might as well do it in your home city. Conor Coady's return to Merseyside might have been good for the England defender and Wolverhampton Wanderers but it has started a nightmare for Frank Lampard. The headed winner by Coady was outstanding while the newly installed Lampard has no more honeymoon period left to call on. He has to start winning games soon otherwise life at Goodison could become rather uncomfortable. The Toffees may have two games in hand over Burnley and three on Leeds but that won't cut any ice with Everton supporters. They are a long way from where they want to be and Lampard is expected to sort it.
Did you know? Coady has scored three goals in 33 appearances in all competitions for Wolves this season, as many as he had in 275 matches for the club in his previous six seasons with them. 
Antonio Rudiger: Under normal circumstances a win at home against Newcastle United by the European champions, regardless of the Geordie resurgence, would not have required special mention. However in the current climate I thought this was an outstanding performance by Chelsea who have been thrown into turmoil by government sanctions imposed on them. Rudiger is one of their key players who is out of contract at the end of the season, with the club now unable to renegotiate his contract due to the sanctions. You would never have known by the passion, determination and sheer enthusiasm of his performance. Looking at the attitude of the players and manager after the match one or two might still hang around regardless of their contractual situation. Read more about this extraordinary situation unfolding at Chelsea in the Crooks of the Matter below.
Did you know? Rudiger has made more headed clearances (36) and won more aerial duels (48) than any other Chelsea player in the Premier League this season.
Midfielders - Andriy Yarmolenko (West Ham), Martin Odegaard (Arsenal), Christian Eriksen (Brentford), Raphinha (Leeds)
Christian Eriksen: The Dane was instrumental in Brentford's victory away at Norwich last week but the quality he produced for the cross to enable Ivan Toney to score against Burnley was just exquisite. It was without doubt the only bit of genuine quality in the entire match. Brentford desperately needed these points and that became plainly obvious by the reaction of the players, their manager and their fans immediately after the game. I reckon eight more points should make Brentford safe. With 30 points already on the board if they can't get the remaining number of points with nine matches left to play they don't deserve to remain in the Premier League.
Did you know? Eriksen registered his first Premier League assist since December 2019, when he set up Jan Vertonghen's winning goal against Wolves for Spurs. Since his first Premier League appearance in September 2013, only Kevin de Bruyne (80) has more assists in the competition than Eriksen (63).
Martin Odegaard: I was taken to task last week by a punter, in a petrol station of all places, who asked me why I hadn't selected Martin Odegaard in my team after his performance against Watford. I had thought about putting Odegaard in for a while but realised I had run out of places. Reece James, Philippe Coutinho, Kevin de Bruyne and Riyad Mahrez were a bit spicy I told this punter, but I did say to him he had a fair point. No such problems this week. In a performance that was not scintillating but professional - and I thought Leicester were poor - Odegaard looks a touch of class. Arsenal are turning out steady, consistent performances. I wish I could say the same about their neighbours.   
Did you know? Odegaard created six chances for Arsenal in this game - five of those came during the first half, which was the most chances created in the first half of a Premier League game by an Arsenal player since Mesut Ozil against Everton in October 2017 (6).
Andriy Yarmolenko: The moment the substitution was made my immediate thought was: 'Does he have the mental strength to cope with Premier League football with everything else that must be going on in his life?' Not only did the Ukraine international cope with the occasion but his goal was magical. Football has a habit of throwing up moments like this but to see an entire stadium rise to its feet in admiration of Yarmolenko's goal and strength of purpose is about as good as football gets. This was an excellent win for the Hammers and keeps them in the hunt for a top-four finish.
Did you know? Yarmolenko scored the first Premier League goal by a Ukrainian since the very same man scored against Aston Villa in July 2020, with that goal also coming from the bench at the London Stadium.
Raphinha: What a game this was and it had Elland Road jumping as a consequence. Norwich played their part and on another day might have got a point out of this match. However it took the magic of Raphinha to inspire not just the team but the crowd. The Brazilian hit the woodwork on two occasions and provided the assist for Joe Gelhardt to seal their victory in the 94th minute. To think Marcelo Bielsa left Raphinha out of the game against Manchester United a few weeks ago. It might not have effected the result but you don't leave players of his quality on the bench when you're fighting for points to stay in the league.
Did you know? Raphinha has been directly involved in 12 goals for Leeds in the Premier League this season (nine goals, three assists) - more than any other player in that side.
Forwards - Luis Diaz (Liverpool), Cristiano Ronaldo (Man Utd), Ivan Toney (Brentford)
Cristiano Ronaldo: Just when you think Spurs are making progress something comes along to convince you it was all smoke and mirrors. The person this time to shatter all Tottenham's illusions that they might be a top-four side was Cristiano Ronaldo. The Portuguese superstar was in blistering form against Spurs at Old Trafford. Ronaldo was left out of the starting line-up against Manchester City with a suspected hip injury. It was just as well because he was looking jaded and seems to have benefited from the rest. Here is someone who still wants to play every week but as an outfield player and especially as a striker aged 37, someone should tell him that even he should give way to youth occasionally.  
Did you know? Ronaldo has scored a hat-trick in each of the last 13 seasons of his club career (every season since 2009-10), with his treble against Spurs being his 49th career hat-trick at club level.
Luis Diaz: I said after the Carabao Cup final that this lad looked a bit special and he continued to prove the point at Brighton. The way the player has slotted into the Liverpool setup in just a couple of months you could be forgiven for thinking he has been there all his life. Fortunately for Diaz he escaped serious injury, having shown immense bravery, after what can only be described as the most diabolical challenge by Brighton keeper Robert Sanchez. How Mike Dean, a referee who seems to take pride in holding the record number of sendings off, inexplicably allowed Sanchez to remain on the pitch only compounds my theory that he knows everything about the rules but cannot distinguish between what is reckless and what is not. 
Did you know? Diaz became the first player to score on his first away Premier League appearance for Liverpool since Mo Salah against Watford in August 2017.
Ivan Toney: I caused a bit of a stir on Final Score and my colleagues Dion Dublin and Jason Mohammad raised eyebrows when I suggested that Ivan Toney would make a good fit for Arsenal next season. I think they were slightly taken aback because they thought I might know something or have an inside track but my comments were purely speculative. After all Ollie Watkins, a former Brentford striker, has made the transition at Aston Villa. Toney would be an ideal replacement if Alexandre Lacazette, for example, were to leave the Gunners in the summer. Unlike Watkins when he transferred to Villa, Toney is already scoring goals in the Premier league and plenty of them - he has no transition to make. As for Brentford, if Arsenal do come knocking, the west London club may have no choice but to accept the money. Brentford have a habit of selling when a player is hot.   
Did you know? Toney has scored seven goals in his last five Premier League appearances, after having scored just four goals in his first 19 appearances this season for Brentford. 
The Crooks of the Matter
I find myself, and for the third consecutive week, writing about the fortunes of Chelsea Football Club and its owner. The truth of the matter is no-one actually knows their fortunes anymore, particularly since Her Majesty's Government imposed sanctions on the club. The sanctions have left Chelsea unable to sell matchday tickets, merchandise, or renegotiate contracts due to the new measures. It has also left supporters unable to attend games unless they are season ticket holders. No transfers in or out will have a big impact on the club as this could allow some of their best players to leave Stamford Bridge having not renewed their contracts. 
These sanctions were supposed to hurt Roman Abramovich, who has now lost a £3bn asset and £1.5bn in loans. But it has also hurt a football club's ability to operate. The players might be loaded and can wait until the club is sold in order to be paid and for the club to renew its financial activities but there will be people on their payroll who can't.
This will cause massive uncertainty for all the club's employees, however glorified they might be, not least the manager Thomas Tuchel. The German seems to have been thrust into the glare and appears to be the only articulate voice at the club prepared to say anything remotely coherent on this matter at all.
I'm sure it was never the government's intention to hurt the innocent parties in this particular matter, and they would say they are doing it so money can't be taken out of or made for Chelsea by one of Vladimir Putin's known associates as part of a so-called cultural war.
It's right and proper that individuals should be made accountable for their actions and, where appropriate, even their relationships. But this issue here is about Abramovich and not Chelsea Football Club, and I'm not sure the licence they have been granted does enough to protect the club as a cultural asset - as it was supposed to do.

What happened to England against Ireland on Saturday will be gold dust for the future.
It does not get much tougher than going down to 14 men after less than two minutes of play.
Whatever team you are in, whether it is in sport, a school or a business, everyone constantly goes on about team spirit.
Sometimes, you have just got to go to the absolute depths and throw the rule book away. You have to look each other in the eye and recognise that only the players on the pitch are going to win that game. Not the coaches, no-one else, you have got to climb that mountain together.
When Charlie Ewels was sent off for a high tackle, England did that.

Rugby Special: More needs to be done to eliminate head contact - Warburton
The bounceback from England showed character that I have not ever seen from that side.
They are great in the gym, they have got amazing skills and they are super fit but there is something unique about being able to take yourself to a place that you did not realise you could go - not just physically but mentally.
If you want to win big championships or the World Cup, you have to go through those types of scenarios.
Thinking back to England's defeat against South Africa in the 2019 World Cup final, Kyle Sinckler went off injured early and South Africa scored a couple of penalties.
Then England were in trouble and they lost the referee, they lost momentum. They were losing their bearings.
Against Ireland, in a similar moment England's reaction was the complete opposite. They went for a simple, basic gameplan. They had a great kick-chase and a fantastic defence and were just seeing what they could do.
Of course they were a man down against a top-quality side and they ran out of steam, but they were in it for 70 minutes and that change in mentality will stand them in good stead.

Six Nations Magic: Excellent tries, big hits and best moments
I just hope now that the England coaching team can harness the change.
Maybe it shows the coaches that whatever environment they put them in, the players are capable of running that team themselves and playing how they should play on the day.
The defeat puts England out of the title race, but if Eddie Jones' side beat Grand Slam-chasing France Ireland could claim the trophy.
I think England can beat France and to prepare for that game, they should have their feet up all week.
They need full rehab, chilling out, a couple of walkthrough sessions. They have got to have every ounce of energy in the tank if they want to beat France.
You could see that they were gone by the end of the Ireland game, as they should be given the amount of mental and physical energy they put into it.
It would be detrimental to the performance at the weekend if they are asked to do any serious training this week.
England could still finish fifth in the tournament for the second year in a row and if they do, the media might use that to suggest that England are heading towards failure. 
Head coach Jones will say it is all about preparing for the World Cup.
When I was playing, I know I won one Grand Slam but I could not tell you when I came second, third, fourth or fifth.
When you are a player you are living in the present. You want to win games and if you lose, you move on to the next one. The media will be interested in positions, the players will not be fussed about that.

Six Nations highlights: England 15-32 Ireland
France have played incredibly well all tournament but the reason I think England can win is that there is nothing on the match for them.
I think this England side gets a bit locked up and tight about outcomes. It is tough playing for England - there is a lot of pressure and expectation.
There is no expectation for them now. Against Ireland, they showed that they have got their set-piece and kicking game sorted then there is the added nugget of their team spirit.
The thing is, France are going to score tries. If they are going to score three tries, you know you are going to need to score four and it might just be that England need a bit of French flair to do that.
There is a nothing-to-lose mentality on the back of them showing some incredible grit. They were probably thinking after the Ireland game that they were not sure they had that in them, and now they can produce it again.
Conversely, France cannot get away from the fact that they are chasing a first Grand Slam and title since 2010.
England should be discussing that in their meetings this week. Put yourself in France's shoes. A decade of nothing and everybody is now saying they are the best team in the world.
They showed they were a bit nervous against Wales. They showed against Ireland that even though they play a great style of rugby, if they get disrupted they are going to be like any other team and force it a bit.
England are going to get opportunities against France and they can take them if they turn up in Paris with the mindset they discovered against Ireland.

Watch: Anti-war demonstrator disrupts Russia's state TV news
A woman holding an anti-war sign ran on to the set of a Russian evening news programme on the state-controlled Channel 1 on Monday evening. 
The sign, clearly visible behind the presenter, read: ""No war, stop the war, don't believe the propaganda, they are lying to you here.""
The woman has been named as Marina Ovsyannikova, an editor at the channel. 
Russian TV news is tightly controlled by the Kremlin and reflects only the Russian version of events in Ukraine. 
Ms Ovsyannikova is believed to be in police custody.
Her voice could be heard during the broadcast saying, ""No to war! Stop the war!"" before the programme director cut early to a recorded news report.
Before the protest, which happened live on the nightly news programme, she recorded a video in which she called events in Ukraine a ""crime"" and said she was ashamed to work for what she called Kremlin propaganda. 
""I'm ashamed that I allowed myself to tell lies from the television screen. Ashamed that I allowed Russians to be turned into zombies,"" she explained. 
She called on the Russian people to protest against the war, saying that only they could ""stop the madness"". 
From the moment Ms Ovsyannikova's identity became known, she has received dozens of comments on her Facebook page in Ukrainian, Russian and English, thanking her for her actions. 
State-controlled television
Russian television news has long been controlled by the Kremlin and independent viewpoints are rare on all the major channels. 
But new laws introduced since the invasion of Ukraine have made the media landscape even more draconian. Legislation passed earlier this month made it illegal to call the military action an ""invasion"" or to disseminate ""fake"" news about it. 
State-controlled Russian media refer to the war as a ""special military operation"" and paint Ukraine as the aggressor, with a government described as neo-Nazi. 
Several of the remaining independent media outlets have stopped broadcasting or publishing after pressure from the authorities, including the radio station Echo of Moscow and TV Rain - an online TV channel. 
Others, like newspaper Novaya Gazeta, are attempting to report on the situation without falling foul of the new censorship laws.

Access to the BBC has also been restricted inside Russia, leading the corporation to issue guidance over how to continue using its services, external. 
Russia's media watchdog accused the BBC and other foreign broadcasters of the ""deliberate and systematic circulation of materials containing false information"".
Many social media sites have also been blocked, further restricting the number and diversity of news sources available to people inside Russia.

The government has launched its Homes for Ukraine site for those wanting to host a refugee, with 100,000 signing up within the first day.
Housing and Communities Secretary Michael Gove said the UK had a history of ""supporting the most vulnerable during their darkest hours"". 
He said there would be no limit to how many Ukrainians could enter the UK under the visa sponsorship scheme.
Each household housing a refugee will be offered £350 a month, tax-free.
They will not be expected to provide food and living expenses but can choose to offer this.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson said it was ""fantastic"" that more than 100,000 people and organisations had expressed interest in supporting Ukrainians.
""Thank you to everyone across the country who has stepped up to offer their help so far,"" he tweeted, external.
People who wish to offer a rent-free space in their home or a separate residence, for at least six months, can register their interest, external online.
They will be able to individually sponsor a Ukrainian national's visa from Friday. Those initial applications will rely on the applicant knowing a named individual from Ukraine they want to help.
But Ukrainian refugees with no family or other links to the UK can and will be hosted as part of the scheme, Mr Gove said. 
He said the sponsorship scheme was initially only between people who are already known to each other so it gets ""up and running as soon as possible"".
The scheme will be expanded with the support of charities, community groups and churches who can help with matching refugees to hosts. 
No timescale has been announced for when this will happen but Mr Gove said it would expand ""rapidly"".

The government has faced criticism - including from its own MPs - over the speed and scale of its response to the refugee crisis triggered by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
Almost three million people have fled Ukraine since Vladimir Putin ordered the Russian invasion nearly three weeks ago. 
Mr Gove had said the scheme was open to nationals and residents of Ukraine, but his department later clarified that those eligible were Ukrainian nationals and immediate family members who had been resident prior to 1 January.

As part of the scheme, refugees will have access to the NHS and other public services. Their children will be able to attend local schools.
Local authorities will also receive £10,500 in extra funding per refugee for support services - with more for children of school age.
Mr Gove said everyone in the UK was ""in awe of the bravery of the people of Ukraine"". 
""The victims of savage, indiscriminate, unprovoked aggression, their courage under fire and their determination to resist inspires our total admiration,"" he said. 
Both hosts and refugees taking part in Homes for Ukraine will be vetted.
In addition, local councils will check that the accommodation offered is suitable, the government said.
A Department for Education source told the BBC the government was planning for a capacity of around 100,000 school-age Ukrainian children to be placed in UK schools and said they were confident the school system could cope.

She said: ""We could keep essential checks but drop the excessive bureaucracy.""
'Open arms'
Mandi Arnold and daughter Amalia hope to host a refugee
One person putting her name forward is Mandi Arnold, who lives in Shropshire with her partner and three children.
Mandi, 35, says life in her house is already hectic and so ""it might as well be even busier"" with an extra couple of people.
""I would love to welcome someone in my home to give them that security and love,"" she says. ""I've got a lot of love to give and it's the perfect opportunity to give it to someone who's in need.""
Mandi says her two sons are too young to understand what housing a refugee would involve but that she and her husband have chatted to her nine-year-old daughter, Amalia, about it.
Husband and wife team Mandy and Mark Durrell were also among the first to register to offer a room.
The Methodist ministers from Bangor said watching the news from Ukraine had been heartbreaking.
""We want to offer space, companionship, comfort and safety,"" said Mark. ""We have this home. There's two of us and the dog - and there's space here to give someone refuge and sanctuary.""

Refugees at Home, which finds host families for refugees and asylum seekers, said it wanted to see ""as many refugees housed as soon as possible"".
Its executive director Lauren Scott stressed that home visits should take place before a placement is made and called for follow-up support to be offered to hosts and guests alike. 
There should also be plans for what happens ""for the rare situations in which a placement does not work out"", she added. 
All that should be done quickly and also ""in a thoughtful, sensitive and thought-through way"". 
Iryna Terlecky, a board member of the Associations of Ukrainians in Great Britain and chair of the Association of Ukrainian Women, praised the British public's response to the scheme but she told the Today programme £10,500 per refugee ""may well not be enough"" for local authorities.
""What we want to see is that local authorities have the right level of funding so that they can continue to support, not only the families coming over but also their sponsors. 
""For a six-month commitment there will be times when for whatever reason it doesn't work out and local authorities and the established charities and the Ukrainian community need to be there to help in those circumstances.""

Transport Secretary Grant Shapps says he will open his home to a Ukrainian family 
Homes for Ukraine is the second visa scheme the government has set up since the war broke out.
The first has allowed Ukrainians with an immediate or extended family member in the UK to apply for a family visa to join them.
Ukrainian passport holders no longer have to attend in-person appointments at visa application centres to submit their fingerprints and facial recognition, the Home Office said, with applicants now able to fill out forms online before giving their biometrics on arrival in the UK.
Some 4,600 visas have so far been granted through that route, the latest Home Office figures show.
The Home Office has defended, external requiring security checks on Ukrainians fleeing Russia's invasion. It says it must ensure the UK helps those in genuine need as it has seen people falsely claim to be Ukrainian.

Boris Johnson arrives at a meeting of northern European leaders in London
Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said the West made a ""terrible mistake"" and let President Vladimir Putin ""get away"" with annexing Crimea in 2014. 
Writing in the Telegraph, Mr Johnson said ending the West's dependence on Russian oil and gas was vital to end Kremlin ""bullying"".
It comes as the UK banned exports of luxury goods to Russia among other sanctions.
About 100 more people are also expected to be sanctioned under a new law.
The legislation allows the UK to target individuals alongside the US and the European Union, which has signed off its fourth package of sanctions against Russia, external.
In addition, Mr Johnson said the only way to halt President Putin's ""continuous blackmail"" was by ending western reliance on Russian fossil fuels - a process that would be ""painful"".
The prime minister is preparing to head to Saudi Arabia and the Gulf for talks about increasing production of oil and gas to compensate for reduced Russian supplies.
Who are the mega-rich Russians facing sanctions?
How sanctions have changed everyday life in Russia
He also said his promised Energy Security Strategy for the UK would step up wind energy, exploit solar power and make a ""series of big new bets"" on nuclear energy. Further drilling for oil and gas in the North Sea was one suggestion he made.
The UK is to phase out Russian oil imports by the end of 2022.
A decision by the government to talk to Saudi Arabia about measures to bring down the cost of energy has been criticised by many MPs after the country executed 81 people at the weekend.
Downing Street says the UK ""will continue to raise human rights abuses"" with Saudi Arabia.
The prime minister chaired cabinet meeting this morning before hosting a summit of northern European leaders in London.
The leaders of those countries, which form a security alliance called the Joint Expeditionary Force, will consider what steps they can take to help Ukraine and shore up their own resilience against Russia.
In a video call to those leaders, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said the Nato alliance had been ""hypnotised by Russian aggression"" and repeated his plea for western military intervention.
While he welcomed the latest western sanctions, Mr Zelensky said they ""are not enough"" to end the war and called for a full trade embargo on Russia.
Boris Johnson is talking about taking back control again, but this time of the country's energy supply and, along the way, increasing efforts to make the UK a ""net zero"" carbon emitter.
""Green electricity isn't just better for the environment, it's better for your bank balance,"" says the prime minister in his article in the Daily Telegraph. ""There's nothing [Putin] can do to stop the North Sea wind.""
Mr Johnson has been talking about making the UK ""the Saudi Arabia of wind"" for some time now so this is not a new policy, but it would represent a significant acceleration of the move towards low carbon power.
Yes, he is backing new drilling in the North Sea, but there's also the promise of ""big new bets"" on nuclear power and - a surprise for many - no mention of the return of fracking, a controversial method of shale gas mining.
In his article in the Telegraph, external, Mr Johnson said: ""When Putin invaded Ukraine the first time round, in 2014, the West made a terrible mistake. The Russian leader had committed an act of violent aggression and taken a huge chunk out of a sovereign country - and we let him get away with it.""
Mr Putin ordered the annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 after months of protests against its pro-Russian president culminated in his ousting. He then backed an eastern rebellion by pro-Russian separatists, who have fought Ukrainian forces in an eight-year war that has claimed 14,000 lives.
Despite years of western sanctions, Russia remains firmly in control of Crimea, which it absorbed following a referendum vote discredited by much of the international community.
Since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine last month, a growing number of Russians have been sanctioned by the UK. Most recently, 386 Russian MPs who voted to recognise two rebel-held areas of eastern Ukraine as independent have been hit by asset freezes and UK travel bans.
Russia has maintained its grip on Crimea despite years of western sanctions
In its latest sanctions, the EU has agreed bans on any transactions with certain Russian state-owned enterprises and the export of luxury goods to ""directly hit Russian elites"".
Sources have told the BBC that the EU's measures will target Chelsea football club owner Roman Abramovich, who has already been sanctioned by the UK. 
Co-ordinated with western allies, the sanctions ""will further contribute to ramping up economic pressure on the Kremlin and cripple its ability to finance its invasion of Ukraine"", the European Commission said.
BBC Brussels correspondent Jessica Parker says the EU has gone farther and faster than many expected, although there is a growing rift between cautious countries and those like Poland and the Baltic states, who want even stronger measures.
On Tuesday, the UK announced new sanctions, external that mirrored the EU's in several areas, including the export ban on luxury goods such as high-end fashion and works of art.
As part of these measures, Russian vodka and hundreds of other goods worth £900m were hit with an additional 35% import tariff.
Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the new tariffs ""will further isolate the Russian economy from global trade"".
On top of this, the UK's fast-tracked Economic Crime Bill, which passed through Parliament the early hours of Tuesday, will now allow the UK to automatically sanction those who have had their assets already frozen by the EU, US or Canada.
This will potentially open the door to hundreds more individual sanctions.
Foreign Secretary Liz Truss is likely to announce new measures on Tuesday on more than 100 individuals with links to President Putin's regime, the BBC understands.
Speaking to BBC's Hardtalk, senior Conservative and chair of the Defence Select Committee Tobias Ellwood said sanctions on Russia would lead members of the Russian elite and generals to ""recognise there is no future for Russia"" and Mr Putin would ""eventually go"".
However, Mr Ellwood warned that ""until then, he will cause absolute carnage in Ukraine and beyond unless we stand up to him"".

416,416,Roman Abramovich: New evidence highlights corrupt deals,"Mon, 14 Mar 2022 17:01:57 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-60736185,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-60736185?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,BBC Panorama uncovers new evidence on the corrupt deals that helped Chelsea's owner make his fortune.,"Roman Abramovich: New evidence highlights corrupt deals
A BBC investigation has uncovered new evidence about the corrupt deals that made Roman Abramovich's fortune.
The Chelsea owner made billions after buying an oil company from the Russian government in a rigged auction in 1995.
Mr Abramovich paid around $250m (£190m) for Sibneft, before selling it back to the Russian government for $13bn in 2005.
His lawyers say there is no basis for alleging he has amassed very substantial wealth through criminality.
The Russian billionaire was sanctioned by the UK government last week because of his links to Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Mr Abramovich's assets have been frozen and he has been disqualified as a director of Chelsea Football Club.
What do sanctions mean for Chelsea?
Who are the mega-rich Russians facing sanctions?
The Russian billionaire has already admitted in a UK court that he made corrupt payments to help get the Sibneft deal off the ground.
He was being sued in London by his former business associate Boris Berezovsky in 2012.
Mr Abramovich won the case, but he described in court how the original Sibneft auction was rigged in his favour and how he gave Mr Berezovsky $10m to pay off a Kremlin official.
BBC Panorama has obtained a document that is thought to have been smuggled out of Russia.
The information was given to the programme by a confidential source, who says it was secretly copied from files held on Mr Abramovich by Russian law enforcement agencies.
The BBC cannot verify that, but checks with other sources in Russia have backed up many of the details in the five-page document.
The document says that the Russian government was cheated out of $2.7bn in the Sibneft deal - a claim supported by a 1997 Russian parliamentary investigation. The document also says that the Russian authorities wanted to charge Mr Abramovich with fraud.
It says: ""The Dept. of Economic Crimes investigators came to the conclusion that if Abramovich could be brought to trial he would have faced accusations of fraud… by an organised criminal group.""

Roman Abramovich's Dirty Money is on BBC One, Monday 14 March, at 20:00 GMT and on BBCiPlayer afterwards
Panorama tracked down Russia's former chief prosecutor, who investigated the deal in the 1990s. 
Yuri Skuratov did not know about the secret document, but he independently confirmed many of the details about the Sibneft sale.
Mr Skuratov told the programme: ""Basically, it was a fraudulent scheme, where those who took part in the privatisation formed one criminal group that allowed Abramovich and Berezovsky to trick the government and not pay the money that this company was really worth.""
The document also suggests Mr Abramovich was protected by former Russian President Boris Yeltsin. 
It says law enforcement files on Mr Abramovich were moved to the Kremlin and that an investigation by Mr Skuratov was stopped by the president.
The document says: ""Skuratov was preparing a criminal case for the confiscation of Sibneft on the basis of the investigation of its privatisation. The investigation was stopped by President Yeltsin … Skuratov was dismissed from his office.""
Mr Skuratov was sacked after the release of a sex tape in 1999. He says it was a stitch-up to discredit him and his investigation.
He said: ""This whole thing was obviously political, because in my investigations I came very close to the family of Boris Yeltsin, including via this investigation of the Sibneft privatisation.""
Mr Abramovich remained in the Kremlin inner circle when Vladimir Putin came to power in 2000. 
The document contains details of another rigged auction two years later, involving a Russian oil company called Slavneft.
Mr Abramovich formed a partnership with another firm to buy Slavneft, but a rival Chinese company was planning to bid almost twice as much.
Many powerful people - from the Kremlin to the Russian parliament - would have stood to lose out if the Chinese won the auction.
The document says that a member of the Chinese delegation was kidnapped when they arrived in Moscow for the auction.
""CNPC, Chinese company, a very strong competitor, had to withdraw from the auction after one of its representatives was kidnapped upon arrival at Moscow Airport and was released only after the company declared its withdrawal.""
The kidnapping story is backed up by independent sources who did not know about the document.
Vladimir Milov was Russia's deputy energy minister in the run up to the Slavneft sale. He didn't comment on the kidnapping story, but he said senior political figures had already decided that Mr Abramovich's partnership would win the auction.
""I said, look, the Chinese want to come in and they want to pay a much bigger price. They say it doesn't matter, shut up, none of your business. It's already decided. Slavneft goes to Abramovich, the price is agreed. The Chinese will be dragged out somehow.""
There is no suggestion that Mr Abramovich knew anything about the kidnapping plot, or played any part in it.
His lawyers told the BBC the kidnap claim ""is entirely unsubstantiated"" and he has ""no knowledge of such incident"".
Different factions had been fighting for control of Slavneft and there was widespread opposition to the Chinese bid.
Whatever the reason for the Chinese withdrawal, Mr Abramovich's partnership had the only bid left on the table. And they bought Slavneft at a knockdown price.
Mr Abramovich's lawyers say allegations of corruption in the Slavneft and Sibneft deals are false, and he denies he was protected by Mr Yeltsin.

The previous two years had each seen about 3.8 million referrals
The number of referrals for specialist NHS mental health care reached a record high in England by the end of 2021, an analysis suggests.
The Royal College of Psychiatrists says the pandemic has led to unprecedented demand and backlogs and services are struggling to keep up. 
There were 4.3 million referrals, for conditions such as anxiety and depression, in 2021, NHS Digital, external says.
Just under a quarter - 1.025 million - were for children or adolescents.
Child mental health: Huge rise in severe cases, BBC analysis reveals
The previous two years had each seen about 3.8 million referrals. 
The college said the NHS had delivered 1.8 million mental health consultations in December 2021, as the Omicron variant of Covid-19, first identified in South Africa, spread across the UK. 
But an estimated 1.4 million people were still waiting, external for treatment. 
And hundreds of adults were being sent far from home for treatment because of a lack of beds in their area.
'Impossible situation'
President Dr Adrian James said: ""As the pressure on services continues to ratchet up, the silence from government continues to be of grave concern for the college, the wider mental health workforce and, most importantly, our patients.  
""The warning of the long tail of mental ill health caused by the pandemic has not been heeded. 
""Many thousands of people will be left waiting far too long for the treatment they need unless the government wakes up to the crisis that is engulfing the country. 
""Staff are working flat out to give their patients the support they need but the lack of resources and lack of staff mean it's becoming an impossible situation to manage. 
""We don't need warm words or empty commitments. 
""We need a fully funded plan for mental-health services, backed by a long-term workforce plan, as the country comes to terms with the biggest hit to its mental health in generations."" 
Marjorie Wallace from the mental health charity SANE said: ""We need urgent action or our failures to act now may leave us with a lost generation. The huge rise in the number of referrals last year, including more than one million children, suggests that we are sleepwalking into a crisis.
""Mental health staff are so depleted and on their knees that we know of patients and families told they have to wait until something terrible happens before action is taken.""
A government spokesperson said: ""We are committed to ensuring everyone is able to access the help and advice they need, which is why we are investing an additional £2.3 billion a year into mental health services by 2023/24, on top of the £500 million we have made available to address the impact of the pandemic.   
""We will be launching a national conversation to inform the development of a new long-term mental health plan later this year.""

The bar was popular among the city's young creatives
You'll Never Drink Alone were the words that hung above the bar at the Old Hem, an iconic pub in the eastern Ukrainian city of Kharkiv. 
The pub is named after Ernest Hemingway, and its patrons would walk past a statue of the legendary American writer on their way in.
It was popular among the city's young creatives, and Serhiy Zhadan, one of Ukraine's best known poets, would often perform and drink there.
But now the Old Hem lies in ruins. 
The pub was destroyed in shelling on Monday
It was completely destroyed during Russian shelling of the city on Monday. The Kharkiv prosecutor's office says two people died in the attack.
The bar's owner, Kostiantyn Kuts, told the BBC that no staff were in the bar when the strike hit, and those who died were in apartments above the pub. 
The Old Hem stopped pouring pints and turned into a makeshift bomb shelter when the Russian army invaded Ukraine on 24 February, Mr Kuts says. 
He initially hoped that he'd only be shutting up briefly. 
Kostiantyn Kuts founded the bar in 2012
""We did not completely believe in what was happening and hoped that soon the bar would work. But the illusions were destroyed with the first bombs on residential buildings,"" he said in a message. 
In the early days of the invasion, Kharkiv fought back a Russian armoured column. Since then, it has suffered nightly Russian airstrikes and shelling, with dozens of civilians killed and hundreds injured.

But in the weeks leading up to the invasion, Mr Kuts says it was business as usual at the bar. 
""The atmosphere was friendly. Many felt at home in the bar,"" he says. ""The pub was popular among young people, and they were all optimistic and did not believe in war.""
This homely atmosphere was one the Old Hem had built up over a decade.
Mr Kuts says the pub was opened in 2012 as a place where people could ""meet and discuss current affairs over a glass of beer"". It soon became a focal point for Kharkiv's creatives and would showcase local talent.

Yuri, who often visited the Old Hem and declined to give his full name, said it was more of a hub than a pub. He recalls musician Oleh Skrypka, vocalist with the ground-breaking Ukrainian rock band Vopli Vidopliassova, playing a rare intimate show. Parties would regularly continue into the early hours. 
""It was one of the first places in Kharkiv to support Maidan publicly with flags and manifestos on the doors,"" he says, in reference to the protest movement that ousted pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych in 2014.
""Freedom and democracy combined with cheap beer is why youth loved it I guess,"" he says.
The pub was dedicated to Hemingway
The pub was dedicated to Hemingway, one of Mr Kuts' heroes, and had a statue of the writer at the entrance. The walls of the bar were decked out with portraits of other iconic authors including 20th Century Russian writer Sergei Dovlatov, Charles Bukowski and Mark Twain.
""I was often asked the question - why Old Hem?"" Mr Kuts says. 
He said this was out of affection for an old friend rather than a reference to his age.
But what really made the bar was the people, he adds. 
Mr Kuts hopes to one day rebuild his beloved pub
Mr Kuts is now in western Ukraine and is hoping to make it to Germany. But one day he hopes to return to his city to rebuild his beloved bar. 
""I'm sure Hem's story didn't end today,"" he says. ""We will win and Hem will rise again.""

419,419,Scotland's decision day for easing final Covid rules,"Mon, 14 Mar 2022 22:53:25 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-60736253,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-60736253?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,Nicola Sturgeon will announce whether the last measures will end as planned on Monday amid a new surge.,"Covid in Scotland: What's behind the latest surge?
The restrictions introduced to slow down Covid will be with us a little longer
Just a few weeks ago it seemed Covid was at last losing its grip on our lives. 
Under the Scottish government's strategic framework for managing Covid, , external Monday 21 March was meant to be the date when the last legal restrictions would be lifted. 
Now, against a backdrop of surging cases, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has announced that face coverings will be required in shops and on public transport until early April.  So what's changed and why? 
With the world's attention focused on the war in Ukraine, it's unsurprising that a recent resurgence of infections has not attracted the coverage it might have done earlier in the pandemic. 
The previous big Covid surge came in late December and early January when the faster spreading Omicron variant prompted a raft of new restrictions including strict attendance limits on large events, the closure of nightclubs and the return of social distancing in pubs and restaurants. 
Daily case numbers peaked at more than 20,000 on 3 January, then fell away rapidly before levelling off. 
By late February we were typically seeing about 5,500 new confirmed infections per day - but that changed at the start of March. 
Some of the increase may be explained by a change in the way the figures are presented, as re-infections are included in the numbers - but it now seems clear that something else has been happening.
While the daily case figures have in the past been a reasonable guide to infections, the shifting emphasis onto lateral flow tests rather than PCR testing has led to a suspicion that many positive lateral flow results are not being reported. 
Public health experts are increasingly focusing instead on the weekly Office for National Statistics (ONS) survey - where swabs are collected from thousands of households across the UK to give a snapshot of how the virus is circulating. 
Importantly, this survey picks up infections among people who are showing no symptoms, who would not show up in the daily figures. 
The following chart shows how many people in Scotland are estimated to have had Covid each week, based on the ONS sampling.
For much of the time, these ONS estimates mirror the daily cases data, but if you look closely there are some key differences. 
The ONS figures suggest that while Covid numbers did fall back sharply after the early January Omicron peak, this respite only lasted for about a fortnight before infections started climbing again. 
They also suggest that in recent weeks, the daily case figures have drastically underestimated the extent of Covid infection.
The most recent estimate, for the week to 6 March, is that 5.7% (one in 18) of Scotland's population had Covid, the equivalent of 299,900 people - which is the highest figure since ONS sampling began in autumn 2020. 
So what's behind the increase? 
BA.2 - the 'stealth' version of Omicron
Covid-19 has developed numerous variants and sub-variants
The Omicron variant of Covid-19 was first identified in South Africa on 24 November, and was detected in the UK a few days later. 
Fears about its increased transmissibility proved well-founded as it replaced Delta as the dominant strain, but for most people it caused less severe illness - which contributed to a fall in mortality. Vaccination and improved medical treatments have also driven down the death rate.
Omicron is an umbrella term for a number of closely-related versions of the virus -  not so different that they are classed as new variants but instead regarded as ""sub-variants.""
What we know about the new Omicron variant 
The original version of Omicron is known as BA.1 but early this year a number of countries reported a rise in cases involving the BA.2 sub-variant. 
Sometimes dubbed the ""stealth variant"", for most people BA.2 Omicron also causes a milder version of the disease than Delta, but it appears to spread even faster. According to Danish scientists it could be 1.5 times as transmissible as BA.1.
BA.2 is now the dominant strain in Scotland - accounting for 85% of cases - and it's come at a time when many of the earlier restrictions such as vaccine passports and limits on large gatherings have already ended. 
It's also likely that we're seeing waning immunity over time as the protection given by vaccines wears off. For some older people, it was last autumn when they had their third jab. 
Even having had Covid is no guarantee you won't get it again - about 10% of new cases are re-infections, according to Public Health Scotland. 
A spring booster programme is now under way for the most vulnerable including the oldest age groups, to top up their protection with a fourth vaccine dose.
What impact is it having? 
The better news is that, so far, there doesn't appear a sharp upturn in death rates or numbers of people who are so ill that they require intensive care treatment. 
There has, however, been a steady rise since mid-February in the number of patients in hospital with Covid. 
On Tuesday there were 1,996 Covid-positive patients, higher than the January 2022 Omicron peak and not far short of the whole-pandemic peak of 2,053 patients seen in January 2021.
The chief medical officer, Prof Sir Gregor Smith, says hospital occupancy is particularly increasing for the over-60s, partly because of their increased vulnerability but also because older people tend to have longer hospital stays.
Not all of these patients will be in hospital because of Covid - many will have come in for other ailments, but then tested positive.
But regardless of how ill these patients are, such big numbers inevitably put enormous strain on the NHS. 
NHS Lothian and NHS Grampian say they have more Covid patients now than at any time in the pandemic. 
NHS Lanarkshire has said its three acute hospitals are operating beyond capacity and is warning of knock-on impacts on A&E waiting times. 
Greater Glasgow's health board says its hospitals are also near capacity, while NHS Highland says some elective surgery is having to be cancelled.  
Will mask wearing make a difference? 
Some might argue that there's little evidence that mask wearing will slow down transmission given that case numbers are already soaring even with existing restrictions in place. 
Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross argued in Holyrood that the public should be trusted to take the steps they think are right to protect themselves. 
Leading NHS Grampian health expert Jillian Evans, however, had argued that retaining face coverings a little longer would send an important signal. 
She told the Press and Journal newspaper, external: ""Our behaviour is influenced when we see things - such as masks. They are a reminder that we need to be more cautious.""
Prof Sir Gregor Smith had also advocated a cautious approach. 
The phrase ""living with Covid"" is increasingly heard on the lips of politicians and health experts, as we move from a pandemic phase to endemic - where the disease is always with us, possibly with seasonal peaks like with flu, but with measures in place to protect the most vulnerable.
Nicola Sturgeon says the face masks rules should only be with us a little longer, but even when the legal requirement is dropped, the guidance may still advocate their use. 
With spring and summer approaching, the hope will be that pressures on the NHS will ease in the coming weeks, but in the meantime people will be urged to maintain voluntarily many of the safeguards that have previously been backed up by law.

Benjamin Hall reporting from Kyiv
A British journalist working for the Fox News Channel in the US has been injured while reporting on the war in Ukraine, the network says.
Fox confirmed on air that Benjamin Hall - listed as its US state department correspondent - is in hospital after an incident outside of the capital Kyiv.
Afternoon news anchor John Roberts added teams on the ground were still gathering details of the incident.
Mr Hall is said to have been news gathering at the time.
In a memo circulated to Fox employees on Monday, CEO Suzanne Scott said there was ""a minimum level of details right now"" and called for prayers.
""This is a stark reminder for all journalists who put their lives on the line every day to deliver the news from a war zone,"" she wrote.
Mr Hall, 39, joined Fox News in 2015 and has been heavily involved in the network's foreign affairs coverage.
He has covered several wars from the frontlines, including in parts of the Middle East.
A dual US-UK citizen, he completed both his undergraduate and graduate degrees in London.
Anton Gerashchenko, an adviser to Ukraine's interior minister, posted on Telegram on Monday that Mr Hall was in a serious condition.
Mr Gerashchenko added that Ukrainian officials did not currently know the fate of a Fox News cameraman and a producer.
He said the news crew probably ""came under mortar or artillery fire"" from Russian forces as they were heading towards the city of Irpin, which sits just 20km (12 miles) north-west of Kyiv.
Earlier on Monday, Ukraine's prosecutor general Iryna Venediktova had said that a Western journalist had been injured and was being cared for by Ukrainian doctors.
The State Department Correspondents' Association issued a statement, saying the state department's press corps was ""horrified"" to learn that Mr Hall had been injured. 
""We know Ben for his warmth, good humor and utmost professionalism. We wish Ben a quick recovery,"" president of the association, Shaun Tandon, said.
Mr Hall's injuries come after another US journalist - Brent Renaud - was shot and killed on Sunday in the town of Irpin while working in the region. Two other journalists were injured and taken to hospital in the same attack.

421,421,Putin changes law on leased jets to keep them flying,"Mon, 14 Mar 2022 18:21:38 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-60741161,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-60741161?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,The Russian president signs new law allowing foreign-leased jets to keep flying in Russia.,"Putin changes law on leased jets to keep them flying
The new law could allow foreign leased aircraft to keep flying domestic routes in Russia
Russia has implemented a new law making it harder for foreign aircraft leasing companies to repossess their planes in the face of Western sanctions. 
The new law will allow foreign jets to be registered in Russia ""to ensure the uninterrupted functioning of activities in the field of civil aviation"".
Russian airlines have 515 jets leased from abroad worth about $10bn (£7.7bn).
Foreign owners have until 28 March to get them back from Russian companies before sanctions kick in.
The move comes after Bermuda and Ireland, where nearly all foreign-leased planes operating in Russia are registered, said they were suspending certificates of airworthiness for those aircraft.
The measure, signed into law by President Vladimir Putin, could circumvent that by bringing registration and certification of safety within Russia's borders and use the foreign aircraft to fly domestic routes across the vast country.
Since the invasion of Ukraine on 24 February, Western companies have been terminating leases and asking for planes to be returned. 
The majority of international air routes out of Russia are not being flown and many countries, including the UK, have banned Russia's national airline Aeroflot from flying in their airspace.
Hundreds of foreign-owned aircraft remain in Russia. To comply with sanctions, leasing companies are trying to get them back. But that is looking highly unlikely.
If Russia does hang onto these aircraft - collectively worth billions of dollars - they will be able to continue flying, in Russia and a handful of former Soviet republics at least.
But it's one thing to steal aircraft, it's quite another to keep them operating for any length of time.
Airbus and Boeing cannot supply spare parts, so when something needs to be replaced it will have to be taken from another plane, or be manufactured by a third party.
That has serious safety implications. It will also make it virtually impossible to insure those planes outside Russia. Servicing is also a concern - many aircraft are flown elsewhere for maintenance.
And when the crisis is over there will be a huge bill to pay. 
If aircraft are not maintained properly, their value will plummet. So even if lessors get them back, they will demand compensation.
International aviation is an international business, and you have to play by the rules. 
Russia could decide to thumb its nose at the rest of the world now. But one day it will want to rejoin the club - and the conditions for rejoining could be very harsh.

422,422,Ukraine: Eight arrests at oligarch's London mansion after balcony protest,"Mon, 14 Mar 2022 21:21:13 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-60736583,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-60736583?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,"Protesters wanted the property, believed to be owned by Oleg Deripaska, to house Ukrainian refugees.","Ukraine: Eight arrests at oligarch's London mansion after balcony protest
Protesters have draped Ukrainian flags over the property, which is believed to be owned by Oleg Deripaska
A demonstration at a mansion linked to Vladimir Putin ally Oleg Deripaska has ended with eight arrests, police said.
Protesters occupied the balcony of 5 Belgrave Square, in central London, about midnight, and stayed most of the day, despite police efforts to remove them.
The squatters said they were reclaiming the property for Ukrainian refugees.
Just before 20:00 GMT the Met tweeted the protests were over and that eight people had been arrested in total.
A spokesman said four were arrested inside the building, and four more outside.
Police said they have searched the property and are satisfied there is no-one left inside, although a presence will be kept at the scene overnight.
Billionaire energy tycoon Mr Deripaska is one of the oligarchs sanctioned by the UK government following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
Met police make arrests close to the building in Belgravia, central London
A Met Police spokesman said four arrests were made about 18:00 GMT, for trespass, after protesters had tried to climb the back of the building, which is the Romanian consulate.
Earlier in the day riot police had entered and searched the property but found nobody inside. 
Four people remained on the balcony, despite police negotiators' attempts to talk them down, and the spokesman said they would be monitored overnight.
The group called themselves the London Makhnovists, after the Ukrainian anarchist Nestor Makhno, who revolted against the Russian White Army in 1918-21.
There are links between Russian political donors and the war in Ukraine, the protesters claimed
Standing on the balcony, one of the protesters told journalists they were doing the government's work for them by reclaiming the building for refugees fleeing their homes.
He said: ""[Home secretary] Priti Patel, don't worry, we did your job - we did the housing, just send them here, we did the housing. Refugees welcome!
""We're demanding this property belong to Ukrainian refugees. Their houses have been destroyed and this guy [Deripaska] supported the war.""
The group said there were about 200 rooms in the ""ridiculous"" mansion, which was ""filthy fancy"" and had ""so much stuff a normal human being would never need"", including a home cinema and works of art.
The protesters said there were about 200 rooms in the mansion
""It is massive,"" one of the protesters said. ""I got lost I don't know how many times. There are so many unnecessary rooms.""
Another added: ""[Michael Gove] said oligarchs' homes should be expropriated to house Ukrainian refugees.
""We're doing the government's work for them and we're doing it for free, so I expect a significant rebate on my tax bill later on in April.""
Sanctioned oligarchs' properties could be used for refugees- Gove

Speaking about the possibility of arrest, one said the group has ""made peace"" with the option and added ""I'm ready to take the consequences for something I believe"".
In response, the prime minister's official spokesman said he thought new legislation would be needed to use seized property to house refugees.
He added: ""Squatting in residential buildings is illegal, but we are working to identify the appropriate use for seized properties while owners are subject to sanctions."" 
Police remain outside the Belgravia mansion
Ivan, who was passing by, said he was originally from Lviv in western Ukraine and fully supported the protest.
""I think it's very good,"" he said, adding he believed the mansion belonged to Mr Deripaska, who is ""a friend of Putin"". 
""My people are suffering and they need help,"" he said.
Other passers-by were supportive of the occupation, saying they were unable to protest themselves but the action would make a difference.
Ivan, from Lviv in Ukraine, supports the protest
One man said: ""We need to protest in every way we can because this war is not right. A lot of civilians and women and children are dying every day for Putin and it's unbelievable.""
Charles Delingpole, who said he works in the field of sanctions, said he supported the protest but it was important to uphold the rule of law.
He said: ""I think the UK has been too slow to sanction Russian oligarchs based on an abundance of caution as opposed to due process.
""However, this is the breakdown of law and just because we fight with monsters doesn't mean we need to turn into them ourselves.""
The government has been too slow to sanction oligarchs, said Charles Delingpole
Mr Deripaska, founder of metals and hydropower company EN+, has been under US sanctions since 2018 as a result of his alleged close relationship with the Kremlin.
A 2006 High Court judgement revealed Mr Deripaska was the beneficial owner of Five Belgrave Square.
The seven-bedroom house, in one of London's most expensive neighbourhoods, also has a home cinema, a gym and a Turkish steam bath.
The property had been bought through Ravellot Limited, an offshore company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands, and the business still owns the property. 
Russian tycoon Oleg Deripaska attends a session of the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum (SPIEF) in Saint Petersburg, Russia, June 3, 2021
Land Registry documents give Graham Bonham Carter as the contact for Ravellot. 
Five bank accounts held by him are subject to asset freezing orders at the request of the National Crime Agency (NCA), following the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
The bank accounts were frozen because of suspected links to Mr Deripaska, the NCA said.

423,423,China: Businesses shut as officials widen Covid lockdowns,"Tue, 15 Mar 2022 04:49:41 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-60703301,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-60703301?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,"Toyota, Volkswagen and Apple supplier Foxconn are among firms halting their operations.","China: Businesses shut as officials widen Covid lockdowns
Jilin province has been one of the worst affected by the latest Covid outbreak in China
Multinational companies have halted some operations as China widens its Covid lockdowns - among its biggest since the start of the pandemic.
Tens of millions of people across the country face restrictions, including the entire Jilin province and technology hub Shenzhen, as authorities report record numbers of cases.
Toyota, Volkswagen and Apple supplier Foxconn are among the firms affected.
The lockdowns have raised concerns that crucial supply chains may be disrupted. 
China on Tuesday reported a record high of more than 5,000 cases, most of it in Jilin.
All 24 million residents of the north-eastern province were placed under quarantine orders on Monday. It is the first time China has restricted an entire province since the Wuhan and Hebei lockdown at the beginning of the pandemic. 
Jilin residents have been banned from moving around, and anyone wanting to leave the province must apply for police permission. 
It came a day after a five-day lockdown was placed on the 12.5 million residents of the southern city of Shenzhen, with all buses and subway services suspended. 
On Tuesday authorities in Langfang city which borders the capital Beijing, as well as Dongguan in the southern province of Guangdong, also imposed immediate lockdowns.
The messy cost of China's harsh lockdown playbook
Why China is still trying to achieve zero Covid
Businesses in many of the affected regions have been told to close or have their employees work from home, unless they supplied essential services like food, utilities or other necessities. 
Foxconn, which manufactures iPhones for Apple, stopped its operations in Shenzhen on Monday, saying the date of resumption would ""be advised by the local government"". 
But it has several production sites in China and told the BBC it had ""adjusted the production line to minimise the potential impact"". Its plant in Zhengzhou - the world's largest iPhone factory - remains open, as the city was not hit by the restrictions. 
Toyota, which shut its factory in Changchun city in Jilin province, did not give a timeline for when business would resume. The Japanese carmaker told the BBC that the move was made to consider the ""impact of supplier operation"", and the ""safety and security of employees and related parties"". 
German carmaker Volkswagen also shuttered operations in Changchun, saying production of Volkswagen and Audi cars and their components was ""affected"", but that it hoped to reopen its factory on Thursday.  
On Tuesday the Shanghai Composite lost 5% and the Hang Seng index, where several Chinese technology giants are listed, fell more than 6%.
Analysts believe that firms would be able to manage the disruptions. ""Such lockdowns have happened before, and [cities] have re-opened within a short period of time once the number of Covid cases were within control,"" Yeang Cheng Ling, senior investment strategist at Singapore's DBS Bank, told the BBC.
UBS analyst Grace Chen said Shenzhen was not a ""major"" production site for suppliers, but it would be worrying if the lockdowns extended to Shanghai and surrounding areas as the region is a key manufacturing hub for notebooks, servers and smart devices.
It feels like China has gone backwards. Two years backwards. To the early days of the outbreak that first emerged here. 
Drastic measures are being imposed - again - on a large scale, to try to contain the virus. An entire province has been sealed off. 
The lockdown of Jilin is similar in so many ways to Hubei in early 2020; the area of China where it all began. 
Shenzhen, the globally important tech hub (where your iPad was most likely made) is also a city in lockdown. 
Shanghai - where I am writing this - home to 24 million people, is a nervous place. All schools are closed, children are learning online, increasingly people are working from home. 
Some compounds where people live are enforcing strict rules on who can come in. Deliveries are being sprayed with disinfectant again at the gates. 
It's all part of the ongoing effort to maintain/retain/regain China's ""dynamic zero-Covid"" strategy - a goal that has been boosted by the mass roll-out of China's homemade vaccines, and that has been helped hugely by effectively shutting China's borders. 
But now that goal is being significantly undermined by the Omicron variant.
China has seen relatively fewer cases of Covid due to its strict zero-Covid policy, where it resorts to rapid lockdowns, mass testing and travel restrictions whenever clusters have emerged. 
However the rapid transmissibility of the Omicron variant has made sticking to that approach increasingly challenging. 
Since the start of the year, China has reported more domestically transmitted cases than in the entire 2021. 
Top Chinese infectious disease expert Zhang Wenhong has called the recent outbreaks ""the most difficult period in the last two years of battling Covid"" and that they were still in ""the early stage of an exponential rise"", in an online post widely circulated on social media.
But he added that while it was necessary for China to maintain its zero Covid strategy to control the outbreaks for now, ""this does not necessarily mean we will continue implementing the strategy of lockdowns and mass testing forever"".

Outdoor civil weddings and partnerships are being legalised permanently in England and Wales.
Until last summer, non-religious ceremonies had to be held inside or in a permanent outdoor structure.
The rules were relaxed to allow for more guests while coronavirus social distancing measures were in place.
The temporary measures are being made permanent from April after ""overwhelming support"" from the public, the Ministry of Justice said. 
A government consultation found that 96% of respondents were in favour of the changes being made permanent, with 93% supporting it being extended to religious ceremonies.
The weddings and partnership ceremonies will still have to be held at licensed venues. 
Reforms to religious ceremonies will follow, the Ministry of Justice said.
Civil weddings and partnerships can be held outdoors for first time
Covid 'has highlighted archaic wedding laws'
Justice minister Tom Pursglove said: ""A wedding is one of the most important days in a person's life and it is right that couples should have greater choice in how they celebrate their special occasion.
""These reforms will allow couples to hold more personalised ceremonies and provide a welcome boost for the wedding sector.""
The government is to also consider recommendations from a Law Commission review into marriage laws, which is due to be published in July.
The report is looking at how to modernise marriage law, including widening the locations where people can get married and whether more types of weddings should be legalised.
Until 1994, marriage ceremonies in England and Wales could only take place in churches and register offices. 
An amendment to the law permitted ceremonies at other locations including landmarks, stately homes and dedicated wedding venues. The sites must be approved by local councils, with a registrar attending to record the ceremony. 
For historical reasons, the law already allows Jewish and Quaker wedding ceremonies the option of taking place outdoors. 
But other religious ceremonies still currently take place indoors in churches or certified places of worship.

Cheltenham tickets have sold in record time and more than 60,000 racegoers are expected each day

The roar which greets the start of racing's Cheltenham Festival will be heard for the first time in two years as crowds return on Tuesday.
Last year's four-day fixture, which usually attracts a total attendance of about 250,000, was held behind closed doors because of Covid-19.
Rachael Blackmore will look to win the opening day's Champion Hurdle again with Honeysuckle.
She made history in 2021 as the first woman to be the meeting's top jockey.
The unbeaten mare Honeysuckle seeks a 15th straight career win in Tuesday's feature race at 15:30 GMT.
Blackmore will ride last year's runner-up A Plus Tard against stablemate and defending champion Minella Indo in Friday's Gold Cup.

Latest racecards and results
What will the Festival look like?
Cheltenham was one of the last major sporting events to be held with spectators before the coronavirus lockdown in March 2020.
A year later, winners passed the finishing line to a smattering of applause from stable staff. The noise this time will be a sharp contrast with thousands of Irish punters set to travel over and tickets selling in record time.
Bookmakers expect around £500m overall to be wagered during the Festival and while notes will be accepted by bookies on course, the track's bars and restaurants will be cashless and require card payments.
There are a total of 28 races over the four days with Tuesday's concluding race run as the Ukraine Appeal National Hunt Chase to support those affected by the humanitarian crisis after Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
The big clashes
British trainers aim to do better than a year ago when they went down to a record 23-5 defeat by Irish runners as Blackmore won more races (six) than all the GB trainers.
Blackmore won on Allaho, Sir Gerhard, Telmesomethinggirl, Honeysuckle, Quilixios and Bob Olinger last year
Here's some of this year's highlights:
Tuesday - Supreme Novices Hurdle: Trainer Nicky Henderson will be hoping to provide a home win in the opener with Constitution Hill or Jonbon while Dysart Dynamo heads three runners for Willie Mullins.
Champion Hurdle: The Irish powerhouses of Henry de Bromhead, Mullins and Gordon Elliott saddle the first three in the betting in Honeysuckle, Appreciate It and Teahupoo. Between them, the training trio have 22 of the meeting's 28 ante-post favourites. The 2020 champion, Epatante, runs for Henderson.
Wednesday: Queen Mother Champion Chase: Henderson's Shishkin and Energumene, for Mullins - who also runs Chacun Pour Soi - renew rivalry after the former won their first clash at Ascot which was hailed as one of the great races of recent years. Last year's winner Put The Kettle On and runner-up Nube Negra return.
Cross Country Chase: Will two-time Grand National winner Tiger Roll bow out with a record-equalling sixth Festival win? Trainer Elliott is back at the Festival having served a six-month suspension after being pictured sat on a dead horse.
Thursday - Ryanair Chase: Allaho was one of the most impressive scorers last year and will be sent out to defend his title for Mullins, who earlier runs Galopin Des Champs against another Cheltenham 2021 victor, De Bromhead's Bob Olinger, in the Turners Novices' Chase.
Stayers' Hurdle: Three previous winners of this race line up with Flooring Porter taking on Lisnagar Oscar and Paisley Park, the hurdler named after Prince's recording studio and owned by Andrew Gemmell, who has been blind since birth.
Friday - Gold Cup: De Bromhead saddles last year's first two in Minella Indo and A Plus Tard, while Mullins sends out two-time winner Al Boum Photo, who was third last year. Elliott runs Galvin and Protektorat is the leading British hope for Dan Skelton.
What's the weather forecast?
It is expected to be a largely dry week, aside from forecast rain on Wednesday, with temperatures of up to 15C.
The going at the track on the eve of the meeting was described as Good to Soft.

Anna Tymchenko was scared. She had been in labour for hours but her hometown was being bombed and her apartment was shaking. She and her husband were trapped with no electricity, running water or doctor.
The small town of Bucha, 30km (18.5 miles) from the capital Kyiv, had come under relentless bombardment since the start of the war.
Twenty-one-year-old Anna, along with her husband and brother, had previously taken refuge in the basement of their block of flats. But when the electricity was cut off and the heating stopped working, the basement was plunged into darkness, and it was bitterly cold. 
Anna's husband Volodymyr was torn between remaining in Bucha or trying to flee. When they did finally try to escape by car, they had had to turn back when they heard that a column of Russian military vehicles was heading their way.
""We then decided to stay in the apartment,"" Anna told the BBC. ""I preferred to give birth at home and not in a dusty basement. I had difficulty breathing, my lungs hurt."" 
When she went into labour late on 7 March, she called her neighbours for help. They agreed to come, but none of them had experience delivering babies.
Viktoria Zabrodskaya, Anna's 49-year-old neighbour, told the BBC they worried that if something went wrong, they wouldn't know what to do.  
The room was lit with candles and the only available water was freezing cold from bottles.

""I never imagined that I would give birth in such conditions,"" Anna says. ""It was surreal. It was my first child and I didn't know anything."" 
In desperation, Anna's neighbours tried to contact medical staff, but the phone signal was poor. They were eventually able to make contact with a gynaecologist in Bucha after getting a signal from the balcony. He agreed to come but never appeared.   
Later that day, he messaged with an apology and explained that he had been stopped by a Russian patrol who had broken his phone. 
Anna's neighbours would have to deliver the baby themselves. Only one of them - Irina Yazova - had any medical expertise. 
""When the baby's head came out, we got scared,"" Viktoria says. ""She was blue and we didn't know what to do. Then Irina gently turned the baby's head and she came out. She didn't cry at first - we started hitting her, and then she cried and we all cheered.""
Husband Volodymyr cried tears of relief for baby Alisa, who was born on 8 March - International Women's Day.

Two days later, it was announced that Bucha was one of the evacuation corridors agreed by the Ukrainian government and the Russian defence ministry.
""We spent the whole night discussing whether to go or not,"" Anna says.
She and her husband finally decided to leave with their new-born child. They tried to contact people to ask if the route was safe, and downloaded maps on to their phones.
Driving out of Bucha, Anna and Volodymyr saw the destruction caused by Russian strikes
The following day, 21 cars left the town heading towards Kyiv. Viktoria, who had helped deliver Anna's baby, drove at the front of the convoy, a white flag wrapped around a mop attached to her car and a sign saying ""Children"".  
""On the way we saw horrible scenes,"" Anna says. ""I never thought that I would see such things in real life - only in movies. There were dead bodies lying on the road. The houses were destroyed. Russian tanks parked, pointing their barrels at the road. We were so scared that they could fire when we passed by."" 
After several hours the evacuees had safely passed all the Russian checkpoints and arrived in Kyiv - and from there went their separate ways. 
""When we got out, I couldn't stop smiling,"" Anna says. ""I couldn't believe that we managed to flee.""  
Anna is enjoying motherhood and is looking forward to introducing her parents to their new granddaughter. But while many of her relatives have now left the country, she and her husband cannot leave - and Anna says that she still doesn't feel completely safe. 
""All my thoughts are with what's happening [in Bucha] and in the rest of the country,"" she says. ""It's just unbelievable but we hope that we can return home soon.""

Firefighters attend an apartment block in Obolon district after an air strike
At a briefing in their war room on Monday, the two Ukrainian generals responsible for the defence of Kyiv told the BBC how their forces were fighting hard to keep Russian artillery out of range, and explained why they believe the city has strengths that will make all the difference against the Russians.
Kyiv is feeling the sharp touch of the war more acutely, along with Russia's destructive firepower. 
A nine-storey block of flats was hit by a Russian missile on Monday morning, killing at least one person and wrecking the building, making dozens of Ukrainians homeless. It would have been worse had many residents not taken to shelters. 
But the centre of Kyiv and many of its sprawling suburbs are still untouched by Russian weaponry. Other Ukrainian cities are being very heavily shelled, and there have been many casualties. 
Kyiv's remaining citizens - perhaps half have moved to western Ukraine or left the country - are facing the possibility that the same brutal experience lies ahead for them.
Rivers and peat bogs help in the defence
The generals responsible for Kyiv's defence said they were fighting hard to keep Russian artillery out of range, but accepted that the capital was vulnerable to missiles.
However the city's topography and terrain is on their side, Gen Andriy Kryschenko told me. The city is big and sprawling. It is cut up by rivers, not just the mighty Dnieper which divides Kyiv in two, but its tributaries. 
Gen Andriy Kryschenko (middle) said the terrain surrounding Kyiv makes it difficult for the large-scale movement of troops
""It is difficult to defend on the one hand, given that it is very large,"" he told me. ""But on the other hand, this is a plus. Rivers, bridges, are on the approaches to the city. Our troops are building defences and fortifications. 
""Around the city there are many small rivers that flow into the Dnieper and there are many peat bogs, so that means the area is not suitable for large-scale movement of troops."" 
Gen Kryschenko, who is also a deputy mayor, was wearing the same kind of informal outfit in army green that his President Volodymyr Zelensky has worn to rally his people, impress his allies and infuriate his enemies. The general also exuded the president's optimism. 
Another advantage, according to the general, is that Kyiv is an industrial city, with workshops and factories that have repurposed themselves to produce the items needed for fortifications - concrete blocks, sandbags, and a variety of savage-looking anti-tank obstacles.
Gen Sergiy Knyazev tracks Russia's military moving towards Kyiv on a big interactive screen at the army's base
Gen Kryschenko and Gen Knyazev stood in front of the big interactive screen they use to track the Russian push towards Kyiv. 
They explained they had attacked and stopped the forward movement of two main thrusts, one from the east and one from the north-west, which included the much talked about 64km (40 mile) column of Russian armour. 
They said it had been attacked and forced to disperse, and insisted it was no longer a threat. 
Strategic bridges blown-up
The north-west is still the Russians' main focus. Gen Knyazev pointed to what he said was the closest force of Russian infantry. It was the other side of the Irpin River, around 20km (12 miles) from central Kyiv.
The Ukrainians have deployed a well-organised and well-armed force, which has blown strategic bridges. Thousands of people displaced from the town of Irpin have been filing over the river on the remains of the one of them with a few possessions and very often, their dogs and cats.  
But the Russians, said Gen Knyazev, have not been able to follow them.  
""These are such marshy lowlands, and they can't pass them. If there were no Ukrainian soldiers, they would simply throw a pontoon crossing over the river. But we are there, and we want to destroy them.""
As we were talking another missile exploded not far from the first one. The noise of the blast could be heard clearly in the war room. ""Listen,"" said a junior officer, ""that was our air defence bringing down another one.""
But it did not take the missile out in mid-air. A trolley bus conductor was killed when it hit the ground with a big explosion that also wrecked a line of buildings. 
Ukrainian military success has surprised their friends, and their enemies. The president and his commanders are more than pleased with the performance of their army and thousands of volunteers. 
But the Russians have not turned anything like their full force on this capital city yet.

Some unaccompanied child refugees from Ukraine will be given visas, the government has announced.
The Home Office changed its initial guidance to say that under-18s must travel with a parent or guardian, which left hundreds of lone teenagers in limbo.  
Almost 100,000 Ukrainians have arrived in the UK after fleeing the Russian invasion.  
How many visas have been given?
As of 19 July,, external 162,000 Ukrainian visas have been issued, from 194,700 applications:
46,600 family visas, from 53,700 applications
115,400 sponsorship scheme visas, from 141,000 applications
As of 18 July, 95,400 visa holders have arrived in the UK:
29,700 family visa holders and 65,600 sponsorship scheme visa holders (figures rounded up to the nearest hundred)
In addition, 15,500 Ukrainians who were already in the UK at the time of the invasion have had their permission to stay extended.
As of 14 July, 14,200 Ukrainian children have places in English schools., external There are no equivalent figures for Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. 
Ukrainian children face school place delays
How Ukrainian refugees and their UK hosts are coping
What issues have there been?
Family members and potential hosts have consistently complained about the time taken for visas to be approved.
Home Secretary Priti Patel apologised for the ""frustrating"" delays.
EU countries allow Ukrainian refugees to stay for up to three years without a visa. 
More than 5.9 million Ukrainians have been recorded in neighbouring European countries, external since the war began, although many have since returned.
Where have Ukraine's millions of refugees gone?
How does the Homes for Ukraine scheme work?
The Ukraine Sponsorship Scheme, external - ""Homes for Ukraine"" - lets those without relatives in the UK come for at least six months. 
Any Ukrainian national - or immediate family member - who lived in Ukraine before 1 January 2022 qualifies.
People with Ukrainian passports can apply online,, external but those without have to go to a visa application centre (VAC), external in a neighbouring country, including child applicants. 
Those granted visas can live and work in the UK for up to three years, and access healthcare, welfare and schools. 
They can also bring their pets., external
On 22 June, the government announced that some unaccompanied child refugees will be able to come to the UK., external
Weeks after the scheme began, the Home Office updated its guidance to say under-18s must travel with a parent or guardian, or be reuniting with them in the UK.
But about 1,000 young people travelling on their own had already applied to come to the UK. The government said that initially only those already in the system will be granted a visa. 
For safeguarding reasons, those offering to sponsor children must generally either be a relative or known to their parents.
Hundreds of unaccompanied teenagers applied to the UK
Who can apply to host a Ukrainian refugee?
Anyone in the UK - of any nationality, providing they have at least six months' leave to remain - can volunteer to host, external the refugees in their own home, or another property.   
Charities, businesses and community groups can also apply.
Hosts are offered a tax-free payment of £350 a month for up to 12 months. 
Local authorities receive £10,500 in extra funding per refugee for support services, with additional money available for schoolchildren.
The Edinburgh-based charity Dnipro Kids has sponsored a number of Ukrainian children
Do you have to know the refugee you want to host?
At the moment people can only apply to sponsor a specific Ukrainian individual or family. 
Those without a personal connection can register their interest,, external and contact refugees through charities, faith groups or local community organisations, including: 
Refugees at Home,, external a charity connecting refugees and hosts
Room for Refugees,, external which has previously settled unaccompanied child refugees with families
Shelter 4 Ukraine,, external a Ukrainian-run service which registers hosts and refugees
Reset,, external which has run a community sponsorship scheme for refugees since 2018
The government gave Reset an initial grant of £300,000, external to run a matching and training service.
Many unofficial Facebook groups have also been set up to connect refugees and potential sponsors.
What are the safety concerns?
The government says everyone who applies to host is vetted,, external and Ukrainian applicants also undergo security checks.
Local councils should approve each property and complete basic Disclosure and Barring Service checks on all potential hosts. However, ""enhanced checks"" are only requested if children are involved.
The BBC found evidence that some predatory men were using the sponsorship scheme to prey on young women.
In April, the UN's refugee agency, the UNHCR, raised concerns about the UK system,, external calling for ""adequate safeguards and vetting measures to be in place against exploitation"".
In EU countries, matching is mainly organised by national authorities and charities, with fewer private arrangements.
Some refugees have had to be rehoused after being placed in unsuitable accommodation. 
How does the family visa scheme work? 
The family visa scheme, external was initially limited to those hoping to join immediate family in the UK, but now includes extended family members. 
It is open to Ukrainian nationals - or immediate family members - who lived in Ukraine before 1 January 2022.
Applications from people without passports must be made at a VAC,, external and applicants must provide biometric information, such as fingerprints.
Those with a Ukrainian passport can apply online,, external with biometric information provided after arrival. 
People granted family visas can live, work and study in the UK, and access public funds for up to three years. 
Separately, Ukrainian nationals granted permission to stay in the UK on or before 18 March 2022 can apply to stay in the UK under the Ukraine Extension Scheme., external
Their partner and children can also apply if they're already in the UK as ""dependants"".

Watch: Drone footage shows extensive Mariupol shelling damage
On day 19 of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, some civilians were able to leave the city of Mariupol along a pre-agreed route for the first time. 
Mariupol, a key port city in the south-east of Ukraine, is facing a humanitarian crisis after nearly two weeks of continuous Russian shelling, with food, water, and medicine running out and communication to the outside world all but cut off. 
There have been several previous agreements to allow civilians to leave the city, but they quickly broke down each time. 
On Monday, however, the Mariupol city council said 160 private vehicles had managed to leave and were on their way to the relative safety of Zaporizhzhia - a city to the north-west. 
The level of destruction in Mariupol was made clear in drone footage, which showed bombed out apartment blocks and smoke rising from the rubble.
A tragic update
Last week, Russian bombs hit a maternity hospital in Mariupol. Powerful images of two pregnant women escaping from the wreckage were shared around the world. 
But on Monday, we learned that one of the women had died along with her baby who was stillborn by Caesarean section. 
After delivering the baby, who showed no signs of life, medics focused on the mother but were unable to keep her alive, surgeon Timur Marin told the Associated Press. 
Ukraine's mass graves
In another vivid example of the terrible conditions in Mariupol, the city's deputy mayor told the BBC that several burial sites had been dug to cope with the rising number of civilian deaths. 
Serhiy Orlov said the city's street cleaners and road repair teams were collecting dead bodies in the street. More than 2,500 people have been killed in Mariupol since the war began, according to a Ukrainian presidential adviser.
The BBC heard similar stories from local officials elsewhere in Ukraine, for example the town of Bucha near Kyiv, where more than 60 people were buried in a mass grave.

The US warns China
Away from the dire situation on the ground, the war continues to have far-reaching international consequences. 
After multiple US news outlets reported that Russia had requested military help from China, the US warned that there would be consequences if Beijing helped Russia to evade sanctions. 
The Chinese foreign ministry accused the US of spreading disinformation, and Russia later denied asking Beijing for military help.
With tensions between the global superpowers so high, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres warned on Monday that further escalation of the conflict ""threatens all of humanity"", with the prospect of nuclear conflict ""now back within the realm of possibility"". 
Vladimir Putin was the most prominent world leader to visit the Beijing Winter Olympics
An oligarch's mansion targeted
Russia's invasion of Ukraine has shone a spotlight on the expensive homes around the world that belong to billionaire Russians, many of whom are allies of Vladimir Putin. 
On Monday, protesters in London climbed onto the balcony of a mansion in central London thought to belong to the energy tycoon Oleg Deripaska, who has been sanctioned by the UK government over the war in Ukraine. 
The protesters said they were reclaiming the building for Ukrainian refugees who have fled their homes.

The UK government is examining whether the properties of sanctioned oligarchs could be used to house refugees, according to the prime minister's official spokesperson, although it is thought new legislation would be required.
Protesters have draped Ukrainian flags over the property, which is believed to be owned by Oleg Deripaska
Much-loved pub destroyed
In the city of Kharkiv, in north-east Ukraine, the beloved Old Hem bar - named after the owner's literary hero Ernest Hemmingway - was destroyed by Russian shelling. 
An extraordinary image shared widely on social media showed the building which once housed the pub reduced to rubble. 
The owner - now in western Ukraine - told the BBC that he hopes to return one day to his city and rebuild his bar. 
""We will win and Hem will rise again,"" Kostiantyn Kuts said. 
The pub was destroyed in shelling on Monday
Russia's slow advance continues
Russia's invasion is taking place on several fronts. 
Although Ukraine's resistance has been stronger than expected, Russian forces continue to take territory in the south and are slowly moving towards the capital, Kyiv.

The aftermath of Russian artillery shelling on a residential area in Mariupol, 10 March
The Russian bombardment of some places in Ukraine is so intense that towns and cities are being forced to unceremoniously bury dozens of civilian victims in mass graves.
Nowhere is this grim reality of war more apparent than in Mariupol, a key port city devastated by constant shelling, where several burial sites have been hastily dug in the past two weeks.
""We can't bury [the victims] in private graves, as those are outside the city and the perimeter is controlled by Russian troops,"" Mariupol's deputy mayor Serhiy Orlov told the BBC by phone.
Locations include a retired city cemetery that has now been re-opened, Mr Orlov said.
Warning: This article contains images that some may find upsetting
On Sunday, the city council said the civilian death toll had risen above 2,100. The heavy Russian shelling has prevented any mass evacuation from Mariupol, despite efforts to open a safe exit route.
Mr Orlov could not give a total for dead civilians buried in mass graves, but said 67 bodies were at one site. ""Some we can't identify but some had documents."" 
Thousands of residents are hiding in cellars and in some cases, he said, people are burying family members privately in courtyards or gardens.
The battered city's street cleaners and road repair teams were collecting bodies in the streets, he said, as municipal services had collapsed. ""Some people were killed during those collections. We've had no electricity, or heating, sanitation, water, food for 11 days,"" he said.
Four-hundred miles to the north west, on the edge of the capital Kyiv, a mass grave was dug near a church in the town of Bucha, local MP Mykhailyna Skoryk-Shkarivska said. It contains more than 60 bodies.
Video of the burial was posted on Facebook by a doctor working in nearby Irpin, Andriy Levkivsky. Doctors buried the victims, who had been brought to Irpin hospital. 
Ms Skoryk-Shkarivska told the BBC that a ""ritual service"" was conducted at the hospital before burial. Not all had been identified and ""nobody knows exactly where the relatives are,"" she said. 
""Now we're discussing with volunteers how to create a digital system to identify people and trace missing relatives,"" she said. 
Russian troops captured the hospital on Saturday and told the doctors to leave, she said, speaking by phone from western Ukraine. Bucha and half of Irpin are now in Russian hands, she said. 
The return of mass graves is a shock for Ukrainians. Many have bitter family memories of World War Two, when Jews and Soviet partisans were murdered by Nazis, and the Holodomor - the famine created in Ukraine by Soviet seizure of grain and livestock in the 1930s.
""My uncle is 92 and even he compared it with his childhood in the war,"" said Ms Skoryk-Shkarivska, who emphasised it is ""important for us to bury relatives traditionally, the Christian way, with praying"". 
""Even now in war people sometimes ask priests to do that,"" she said.

In northern Ukraine the cities of Kharkiv, Chernihiv and Sumy are surrounded by Russian troops and relentless shelling has killed many civilians there too. 
On 6 March Oleksandra Matviichuk, a civil liberties campaigner, tweeted, external a photo of coffins in a trench, accompanied by the message: ""Thus, civilians killed in the Russian bombing of Chernihiv are buried in trenches. Since the main city cemetery in Yatsevo is under constant shelling by the Russian occupiers, the victims are buried in the Yalivshchyna forest."" 
Oleksandr Lomako, secretary of Chernihiv city council, told the BBC that victims of Russian air raids and shelling were being buried in a temporary cemetery. He confirmed that the city's main cemetery was now inaccessible, with Russian troops surrounding the city on three sides, the nearest about 10km (six miles) away.

""After the war we will rebury the dead,"" he said, estimating the city's civilian death toll in the Russian bombardment to be about 200. 
One air raid killed 45 people in Chernihiv - the worst toll, Mr Lomako said - adding that nightly bombing was killing seven civilians on average. ""The planes drop three to four bombs on residential blocks. Also one hit the hospital, but it is still working. Dozens of housing blocks have been destroyed on the edge of the city.""
As well as evidence of mass burials, there are accounts of makeshift graves. 
A mother and son were buried in the courtyard of their new apartment block in Irpin, which has been heavily shelled by the Russians. A photo of the grave was widely shared by Ukrainians, and a tweet, external by journalist Olga Rudenko showed Marina Met and her son Ivan enjoying life in Kyiv before the invasion. 
Makeshift grave of a mother and son in Irpin
For those whose loved ones have suffered the effects of siege and shelling at the hands of invading forces, burial in makeshift graves will no doubt feel like the final indignity.

He returns for the new season after some doubt over his participation following the controversial end the last campaign.
Max Verstappen overtook Hamilton on the final lap of the last race of the season to take the world title after ex-race director Michael Masi allowed some cars to unlap themselves and others not.
Hamilton said: ""I've come back to fight for that eighth (title) - that's what I'm here for.""

High demand for workout gear and health-conscious vegetarian options are now being used to calculate the change in the cost of living in the UK.
Items such as tinned beans, boosted by a rise in plant-based diets, have also been added to the basket of goods used to measure prices.
The review by the Office for National Statistics also saw pet collars added.
But men's suits and doughnuts are out as homeworking shifted how we dress and snack during Covid lockdowns.
The ONS said it decided to add meat-free sausages to the basket of more than 700 goods, which is used to calculate how the cost of living is changing, to reflect a boost in demand for healthier food options.
It also said that the removal of a men's two-piece suit, and the addition of sports bras and crop tops, accounted for the fact that spending on formal clothes has been falling, as well as a ""heightened awareness of fitness"".
""With many people still working from home, demand for more formal clothing has continued to decrease,"" ONS head of economic statistics Sam Beckett said.
Since the start of the pandemic, retailers such as Boohoo and Asos have reported a boost in sales for loungewear items such as joggers or hoodies too.
In total, 19 items were added while 15 have been removed.
And although the deletion of doughnuts from the basket might suggest customers are opting for healthier snacks while working-from-home, multipacks of cakes are still included in the calculation.
Food boss says prices could rise by up to 15%
Why are prices rising so quickly?
Lockdown fashion: 'People are back in pyjamas'
Other additions to the basket of goods signalled a shift in how consumers are spending during the pandemic. 
Anti-bacterial wipes, as well as craft and hobby kits for adults, were included in the basket of goods for the first time.
Pet collars for dogs and cats were also added ""to reflect the growth in pet accessories linked to the increase in pet ownership more generally during the pandemic"", it said.
Items such as atlas books or encyclopaedias, as well as coal, are out too.
The official statistics body pointed out that the sale of domestic coal will be banned in 2023 as part of the government's attempt to tackle climate change. Dropping the item this year protects the index from being affected by big swings in price as that headline approaches.
The publication comes as experts point out that what has been described as the cost of living crisis could be exacerbated by the conflict in Ukraine.
On Monday, research from the Resolution Foundation think tank suggested that the war could see another spike in the cost of living this autumn.

It said that inflation, which tracks how the cost of living changes over time, could reach 10% for the poorest households, whose energy and food bills make up a bigger proportion of their budgets.
Some analysts suggested on Monday that the update to the basket of goods was ""out of touch with the everyday expenditure for the masses"".
Myron Jobson, senior personal finance analyst at Interactive Investor, said that climbing sessions, which was added this year, ""is unlikely to rank highly on the list of spending priorities among those struggling to make ends meet during the cost-of-living crisis"".
""We all have our own inflation number, and it is worth keeping tabs on your spending habits to get a better idea of the goods and services that are eating most into your budget, and where you could cut back,"" he added.
With inflation at the highest rate seen in 30 years, the ONS's methodology has come under extra scrutiny because of the concern that product selections do not reflect purchases made by those on lower incomes.
Poverty campaigner Jack Monroe had complained that the official way inflation is calculated fail to accurately reflect this. 
The ONS has said some changes were already in the pipeline to address that.From 2024, it will use a far wider range of prices from supermarket tills, which should make it easier to work out if certain brands of pasta or beans, for example, are rising faster than others.

Thurso in Caithness was among the places to have a good view of the overnight display
A powerful display of the aurora borealis was visible across many parts of Scotland overnight - from Orkney in the north to Dumfries and Galloway in the south. 
The aurora is a natural phenomenon caused by geomagnetic storms from the Sun. It can appear in the sky as rays of light which shimmer and ""dance"".
Astronomer Steve Owens said the Sun was emerging from a quiet phase in the star's 11-year cycle of solar activity. He said the Sun heading out of minimum to maximum activity over the next few years increased the chances of people being able to see the space weather.
He told BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland that places away from light pollution in northern Scotland offered the best locations in the UK for seeing the aurora - if skies were clear and the Sun was active.
An image of the lights taken from Inverness

Mr Owens said it was usually only possible for space weather forecasters to give a day or two's notice of displays of the lights.
He said: ""Last night happened to be a very good, very strong display.
""It just so happens at the moment we are heading into a more active phase and last night the Sun was giving off solar flares.""
Contributors to BBC Weather Watchers were among those to enjoy views of the aurora overnight.

Three apps help keep the O'Connell family on track
""My husband and I couldn't live without three apps,"" says Jo O'Connell, from Bournemouth in Dorset.
She lives with her husband, Jonathan, their two children, Bethany and Bo, plus one rescue dog. As well as juggling household and family responsibilities, she also runs her own public relations company.
""Everyone has busy lives,"" she says. ""There is school work, appointments, shopping… all constantly demanding our attention. We used to double-book ourselves, waiting to get back home to look at a calendar, or shopping list on the fridge.""
The O'Connells turned to technology, looking for apps that would update on their phones immediately, giving them shared information in real-time.
Trello is a list-making app, which the family use to keep track of household chores, to manage a house renovation, to list account passwords, favourite recipes, and Christmas and birthday presents.
They use Google Calendar to sync activities, and OurGroceries to plan meals and share shopping lists.
""The pace of life just gets faster and faster,"" says Ms O'Connell. ""It can be overwhelming. We never stop.""
Research shows that communication, external is key to maintaining a relationship through stressful times.
With the increased pressures of modern life, is the way we're communicating with our partners changing?
Lou Baltruschat Hollis repurposed a business app to help organise her family life
Lou Baltruschat Hollis, 35, from Bedfordshire, is another working parent juggling a busy schedule. She lives with her husband and their two young boys.
""Running a business full time and having two children - there is always a lot going on in our lives,"" she says.
Research from UN Women suggests that women also took on a greater burden of household work during the pandemic. So, could technology help -among the multitude of apps that promise to help families collaboratively manage their lives, which ones are popular?
Ms Baltruschat Hollis trialled various apps. Then she had a brainwave: to re-purpose an existing app she was already using for her online business. Notion is a project management software that is used for note-taking and task management.
""I found it so helpful to compartmentalise things - from cleaning to Christmas,"" says Ms Baltruschat Hollis. ""Using this tech feels simple and streamlined. It makes life easier.""
When Steven Rueter, 32, from San Francisco, and his now wife, Lily, first moved in together, they found they had new shared responsibilities to divvy-up. 
""We learned that the seemingly simple tasks of running a household can really add up,"" says Mr Rueter. ""I figured, there needs to be an app for this - so I built Merge.""
Task management app, Merge, was launched in 2017. 
""It helps couples organise the everyday responsibilities of living together,"" says Mr Rueter. ""The growth to tens of thousands of users was unexpected. Membership continues to grow daily.""
But it's not all about managing life's mundane tasks. After what has been a largely fun-free couple of years, during the pandemic, there are apps popping up geared to helping couples get their lives back.  Apps that help organise adventures, plan for a family or simply spend quality time together.
Lavina Dsouza and her husband use apps to organise their holidays
""We use quite a few apps as a couple,"" says Lavina Dsouza, 34, from Leeds. ""Some to log expenses or for daily chores. But mostly we use them for travel.""
Previously, Ms Dsouza and her husband would lose track of budgets and end up paying more than they had planned. Now they use an array of apps to plan for their adventures.
""We particularly like TripIt,"" she says. ""It keeps track of all our reservations and tickets, so we're not arguing [over] who was in charge!""
When Tom, 35, and Madeleine, 32, Whiteley, from Surrey, discovered they were expecting their first child, they turned to an app called Kinder, to help them choose a name for their new baby.
""It was a fun way to do something that was otherwise quite boring,"" says Mr Whitely. ""We'd been out of the dating scene for a while, so doing something Tinder-style was a bit of fun!""
Technology can make tasks fun says Kinder founder, Krijn Haasnoot
Kinder uses the 'swipe-to-like' characteristic of dating app, Tinder. It was launched in 2016 by Dutch developer, Krijn Haasnoot. 
In the first year after it was launched, around 3,000 people downloaded the app. In 2018, the app went viral and has now been downloaded 1.5 million times.
""Technology can improve 'old' ways of doing things by making them more fun,"" says Mr Haasnoot.
Another app similar in design to Tinder is Cobble, which promises ""less time planning, more time together"".
""I was tired of going back and forth with my husband every night about what we were doing for dinner,"" says founder, Jordan Scott. ""While there were tonnes of great resources out there, there was nothing to help us collaboratively land on a decision.""
Ms Scott launched decision-making app, Cobble, in June 2020. Since then, Cobble has grown to a team of 16 people and, this year, the firm plan to launch in 15 new cities.
Jordan Scott says her app ends long debates over what to eat or watch on TV
Cobble makes ""decision-ing"" easy, says Ms Scott - what to watch on TV, which bar to go to, where to go on a mini-break.
""Gone are the days of sending 50 texts back and forth, or going around in circles over what to watch, or what to order. We don't need to waste time like this.""
All of the apps mentioned so far, might make life more efficient - but do they just add another layer of screen-based activity?

According to DataReportal, people aged 16 to 64 already spend around seven hours per day on connected devices.
Recent studies have shown screen time, external often replaces healthy behaviours like physical activity and sleep and, rather than making us feel more connected, can lead to loneliness and depression.
Jeremy Edge, founder of internet addiction counselling service Escapingthe.com raises some concerns. He helps people who suffer from gaming disorders, social media addiction and other problematic screen use.
He says that if we are on our devices while in the company of others we are 'phubbing', or ignoring someone in favour of our phones, which ""hurts the relationship and leaves people feeling disconnected"".
Mr Edge says social media should be used to contact loved ones, and to organise a place to spend time together in-person. 
""Great relationships are built face-to-face in the physical world,"" he says. ""Couples need time to talk and connect without any screens or distractions.""
But back in Bournemouth, Ms O'Connell says using tech as a tool can mean we get to spend more time with our loved ones.
""Simply having a few apps can make life easier,"" she says, ""so you can spend more time doing what you love with those you love.""

Over 1.7m Ukrainian refugees have fled to Poland since Russia's invasion began
With Russia's war in Ukraine raging on its doorstep, Poland is holding its breath.
It feels vulnerable on two fronts as the number of refugees coming into the country swells and a military base near its border with Ukraine was attacked.
As a first responder in one of Europe's biggest refugee crises since World War Two, over 1.7m Ukrainians have chosen to flee to Poland, according to the UN's latest figures, external.
Some move on, but most choose to stay because of cultural, linguistic or family ties. As a result, population figures have swollen by 15% in the Polish capital Warsaw over the past two weeks.
In terms of security, alarm bells are also ringing. Over the weekend, Russia bombed a Ukrainian military base in Yavoriv, just 16 km (10 miles) from the Polish border. 
Poland warned the West for years that Russia planned to redress the balance of power in Europe in its favour. Polish leaders were dismissed as alarmists at the time. But no longer.
ON THE GROUND: Poland feels the strain of Ukraine's refugees
NEAR THE BORDER: 'Sky turned red' as missiles hit Lviv military base
ANALYSIS: How many refugees have fled Ukraine and where are they going?
On Monday, the Polish Prime Minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, said Ukrainian soldiers needed and deserved Western support. They were fighting not only for their own freedom, he insisted, but also the freedom of their Eastern European neighbours.
He also described Russian President Vladimir Putin's onslaught in Ukraine as a calculated part of his geopolitical plan. 
Poland's vital link with the West
Once side-lined by some in Nato as a post-communist Russophobe, Poland has now become a linchpin in the eastern flank of the alliance. The strongest part of the chain now linking the West with Ukraine. 
Most of the weapons convoys sent by the West to help the Ukrainian military travel through Poland. On Saturday, Moscow declared those convoys ""legitimate military targets"" inside Ukraine. 
But do Poles believe the Kremlin would attack their country - a member of the European Union - and, more significantly in this case, Nato?
The Western defence alliance's charter says an attack against one of its nations will be viewed as an attack against all.
That would mean a face-off between two global nuclear powers - Russia and the US - something the West is keen to avoid. Moscow too, it hopes.
Warsaw's mayor Rafal Trzaskowski has called for more international assistance (file photo)
Warsaw's mayor and high profile political figure, Rafal Trzaskowski, told me his country wasn't panicking, but that people were beginning to ask questions - especially after Russia's missile strike so close to the Polish border, and Nato's talk of Russia possibly planning chemical attacks.
Something urgent needs to be done about the refugee crisis too, the mayor insisted. 
He said one of President Putin's goals was to divide, and therefore weaken, the West.
""Putin is happy to use fake news, disinformation campaigns or a refugee crisis,"" Mr Trzaskowski argued, warning that, ""if refugee numbers keep rising, the system in Poland will crash.""
He's called for more international assistance - from the European Union and United Nations - in terms of practical help, financial aid and housing refugees in other countries.
Brussels says Ukrainians are welcome across the bloc. It has pledged funds to Poland too.
But the authorities here say it's not enough. The European Commission is coy about mentioning exact figures.
Mayor Trzaskowski has also appealed to the UK to ""get rid of its red tape"" and allow Ukrainian refugees more easily into Britain.
Arguably, Poland's painful past makes it a lot more anxious about the future. 
The arrival of Ukrainian refugees here has evoked national memories of war, followed by decades of Soviet occupation.
This week in Warsaw, I met Polish pensioner Kristina and her friends, busy making Ukrainian flag solidarity ribbons.
""I'm too poor to give money and too old to hold a gun,"" Kristina explained, ""so I do what I can for the refugees. Partly, because I fear for my own tomorrow.""

Only Boys Aloud founder Timothy Rhys-Evans said Wales had been ""elevated by choral music for generations""
A generation of musicians could have been lost in lockdown as people are scared to sing again, Only Boys Aloud's founder has said.
Like so many things, choirs and music groups had to come to a sharp halt when lockdowns began.
Musical director Timothy Rhys-Evans said ""concerted efforts"" were needed to get singers back up to scratch as time away affected their voices.
He said young people needed to ""get off TikTok"" and perform together.
Like any muscle, those used to sing and play instruments need to be trained to be in top shape. 
However, when you are performing with lagging Zoom calls, masks and mute buttons, it can be quite tempting for some to stay quiet.

Now the director of music at the Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama (RWCMD), Mr Rhys-Evans said: ""For these last two years singers, brass players, woodwind players have almost been public enemy number one.
""It's something my whole musical life has been about, creating those opportunities for us to continue to sing as a nation and we were forbidden from doing that.
""So I have great concerns about the impact of that and what it will be like going back to rehearsal. 
""The voice is a muscle and if you don't use a muscle it loses its flexibility, its strength and also the confidence people have when they sing is not going to be there.
""I'm sure we will come through it, but it's going to take some time.""

He said that while people made online meetings work, he was ""just starting to see people lose that freedom to let rip and sing"".
""It's just such a joyful activity, when people have had a few drinks and they're watching Wales in the Six Nations, they burst into song. It's as natural to us as breathing, but when that's been taken away it's going to start to have an impact.
""I think the impact on mental health, particularly of teenagers who have not been able to socialise and discover who they are as musicians, but also discover who they are as people -  is something we will be seeing the effects of for some years to come.""
Elin Manahan Thomas says musicians have taken a ""real knock""
'Singers need to train like athletes'
Classical singer Elin Manahan Thomas, from Swansea, sung at the Duke and Duchess of Sussex's wedding in 2018.
She said people were feeling nervous about performing again at all levels.
""It might seem like small fry in the great scheme of things, but actually they've had a huge knock,"" she said.
""Singing was first to go in the pandemic, very much the last to come back because it was seen as evil because we had to breathe in order to sing.""

""The whole body is involved in making that sound and in tuning and perfecting it. 
""So it's going to take a while for muscle memory to come back, for our breath support to be there, to get back to the level that everybody was at.""
She said for a lot of choirs and musical groups, coming back together has been an ""emotional experience"" but many still lacked confidence.

""I think more than anything it's a social experience singing in a choir, it's about listening to each other because it's about blend and tuning and it's about creating something as a team and that's not going be there straight away.
""It's going to get better and it's a lovely thing to do as a team. But do not put too much pressure on perfection, because it's going to take a while to get back to where you personally want to be, so that you as a team, can create that same volume of fantastic sound.""

447,447,War in Ukraine: Why Vladimir Putin couldn't have trained fighters in Africa,"Tue, 15 Mar 2022 00:40:37 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/60705629,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/60705629?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,A misleading photo has been used by some to suggest the continent should support Russia in Ukraine.,"War in Ukraine: Why Vladimir Putin couldn't have trained fighters in Africa
A black and white image which some people falsely claim shows Russian President Vladimir Putin training liberation movements in southern Africa, has been circulating. 
It has been used by some to justify why African countries should support Russia in the war in Ukraine.

The image was also posted on Twitter by Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni's son.
But it doesn't show Mr Putin in Africa, and the time when people are claiming it was taken is also incorrect.
Putin wasn't in Tanzania
The photograph was widely shared online after it was posted in Zimbabwean blogs at the end of 2018.
The posts claimed it shows Mr Putin in a Tanzanian military training camp for southern African independence movements in 1973.  
Also present in the photo, it was claimed, were future Mozambique President Samora Machel and Emmerson Mnangagwa, now the president of Zimbabwe. 
""Putin stayed in Tanzania training freedom fighters for four years from 1973 to 1977,"" the blogs also claimed.
Mr Putin has visited several African countries as prime minister and president
However, there is no evidence either from Russian or African records of Mr Putin, who was born in 1952, having been to the continent during the 1970s. 
Mr Putin's profile on the Kremlin website shows that he was studying at the Leningrad State University at the time, and graduated in 1975.
Also outside training offered to Mozambican freedom fighters in camps in Tanzania was largely conducted by Chinese instructors, not Soviet ones.
And Mr Mnangagwa could not have been in Tanzania in 1973 as he was arrested in 1965 and imprisoned for 10 years by the white-minority government in then Rhodesia.
President Machel of Mozambique died in a plane crash in 1986
A Russian tour of Mozambique in the 1980s?
Mozambican author Renato Matusse used the photo in his 2018 book, where he says it shows Mr Machel with Soviet military advisers touring a military facility near the country's capital Maputo in the mid-1980s.
But he says it's clear that Mr Putin is not the man in question.
Mr Putin was working as a KGB agent in East Germany between 1985 and 1990 and early on would have been a low-ranking officer, which makes it highly unlikely that he would have been a leading member of such a delegation.
There is also no mention of him having visited Mozambique by the Kremlin, or in any of his biographies.
Georgi Derluguian, who worked as a Portuguese-Russian interpreter in the 1980s, and is now a professor at New York University Abu Dhabi, says the claim that the man in the photo is Mr Putin ""is a joke"".
He says the boots worn indicate the person is a military man, while Mr Putin was an intelligence officer. The appearance is also more like that of an older Mr Putin.
Mr Putin seen here wearing his watch on his right wrist (not the left as in the old photograph)
And one final piece to add to this puzzle. 
The mystery man in the photograph is wearing a watch on his left arm. Mr Putin - at least nowadays - habitually wears one on his right arm.
Although the man pictured is thought to be a Soviet official, so far no-one has been able to confirm his actual identity.

448,448,Ukraine conflict: What military and economic support could China offer Russia?,"Mon, 14 Mar 2022 17:15:27 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/60571253,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/60571253?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,The two have close economic and military ties - but could China come to Russia's aid?,"How is China supporting Russia after it was sanctioned for Ukraine war?
Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping praised the deep ties between their countries, during a meeting in Beijing.
China has become a vital partner for Russia, as it seeks to soften the impact of sanctions imposed by the US and other countries over the Ukraine war. 
Is China providing Russia with weapons?
China has repeatedly denied allegations that it supplies Russia with weapons.
In an interview with BBC News, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said: ""What's not happening is the provision of actual arms by China to Russia for use in Ukraine.""
However, China has been accused of building up Moscow's war machine by providing critical components.
Mr Blinken said: ""Those are being used to help Russia on what's an extraordinary crash course effort to make more munitions, tanks, armoured vehicles, missiles."" 
About 70% of the machine tools and 90% of the microelectronics Russia imports come from China, he added.
China has not supplied Russia with weapons but is accused of supporting Moscow's defence industry
Sanctions announced by Washington in May, external targeted about 20 firms based in China and Hong Kong. It said one exported components for drones, while others helped Moscow bypass Western sanctions on other technologies. 
China defends its trade with Moscow, external by saying it is not selling lethal arms and ""prudently handles the export of dual-use items in accordance with laws and regulations"". 
Beijing exports more than $300m, external worth of dual-use items - those with both commercial and military applications - to Russia every month, according to an analysis of Chinese customs data by the Carnegie Endowment think tank. 
It says the list includes what the US has designated as ""high priority"" items, which are necessary for making weapons, from drones to tanks.  
RUSI, a UK-based think tank has also cautioned about the potential use of Chinese satellite technology, external for intelligence on Ukraine's front line.  
What are the sanctions on Russia and are they working?

Putin in China to strengthen anti-West coalition
How much has trade between China and Russia increased?
Beijing has become Moscow's key supplier of cars, clothing, raw materials and many other products, after Western countries imposed sanctions on Russia.
Trade between China and Russia reached a record $240bn (£191bn) in 2023, up more than 64% since 2021 - before Russia's invasion of Ukraine - according to official figures from China.
Russian imports from China were $111bn and its exports to China $129bn, the figures show.
At their meeting in Beijing in May, Mr Xi and Mr Putin highlighted that the two nations now use their own currencies for 90% of trade, instead of US dollars. 
Mr Putin also said he welcomes Chinese carmakers in Russia - after the US announced a quadrupling of tariffs on China's electric vehicles, to 100%. The export of Chinese cars and parts to Russia reached $23bn in 2023 - up from $6bn the previous year.
He also spoke of ""large-scale mutual projects"" between the two countries, including plans to jointly build planes and helicopters. 
""Russian natural gas is fuelling numerous Chinese households, and Chinese-made automobiles are running on Russian roads,"" said China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi in March, external.
As Beijing boosts its electric vehicle industry domestically, Moscow has become a top destination for petrol models
However, some experts consider this a ""lopsided"" relationship in which Russia is more dependent on China than vice versa, external. 
As of 2023, China has become Russia's top trade partner, while Russia is China's sixth-largest trade partner.
How much oil and gas does China buy from Russia?  
Almost half of all the Russian government's annual revenues come from oil and gas.
Its sales to the US, UK and EU countries have plummeted since the invasion, because of sanctions.
Who is buying Russian oil and gas?
A significant amount of this shortfall has been made up with increased sales to Asia - in particular, China and India.
In 2023, Russia surpassed Saudi Arabia to become China's top crude oil supplier. Beijing imported 107 million tonnes of crude oil from Moscow - a 24% increase from 2022. 
The G7 group of ""advanced"" economies, along with the European Union and Australia, has also tried to limit Russia earnings by imposing a worldwide cap on the price of its oil transported by sea.
However, China has continued to buy Russian crude at above the price of the cap.
India, which has continued to maintain its decades-old relationship with Russia, has also been a major buyer of its discounted oil since the invasion. 
Russia's share of India's total oil imports hit a record high of 44% in June 2023, according to the Bank of Baroda, external, an Indian state-controlled lender.
In 2023, China also imported eight million tonnes of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) from Russia, a 77% increase from 2021.  
Speaking at a trade fair in Harbin on the second day of his visit to China, Mr Putin said energy ties will continue to grow and that Russia is ready to supply China with clean energy. 
Moscow hopes to make progress towards finalising an agreement for a new pipeline - called the Power of Siberia 2 - to export natural gas from Russia's Siberia region to north-eastern China.
China already receives gas from Russia through the original Power of Siberia pipeline, which has been in use since 2019.

449,449,Chelsea & Roman Abramovich: Is this a moment of reckoning for English football ownership?,"Mon, 14 Mar 2022 13:41:46 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/60734095,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/60734095?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,"With the risk of clubs becoming involved in geopolitics now exposed, football authorities and the government face questions over ownership in English football this week.","Chelsea & Roman Abramovich: Is this a moment of reckoning for English football ownership?
'The Roman Empire' flag was on display at Stamford Bridge on Sunday, and some fans chanted Roman Abramovich's name while some Newcastle supporters taunted their rivals with ""no noise from the bankrupt boys"" and ""Chelsea are skint, the Mags are rich"" songs
The sanctioning of Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine has, perhaps like never before, forced English football to confront questions over who exactly should be allowed to own its top clubs.
With the risk of letting clubs becoming embroiled in geopolitics now exposed, football authorities and the government will face questions in parliament on the issue on Tuesday.
So what should and can be done? Why has it taken until now? Is it too late? And what damage has been done?

'The sportwashing derby' and difficult days for football
These are certainly chastening days for the sport. Sunday's match between imperilled Chelsea and Saudi Arabian-bankrolled Newcastle United was dubbed in places as 'the sportswashing derby'. It was portrayed by some critics as one of the darkest episodes in the history of the Premier League. 
With the Club World champions in turmoil, sponsors deserting the club, and fears of financial ruin amid a block on merchandising and ticket sales, Chelsea's fans now face opprobrium because a section of their support continue to sing the name of the man whose fortune brought them almost two decades of glory. 
This singing was despite the government describing Abramovich as ""a pro-Kremlin oligarch"" who has had a ""close relationship"" with Vladimir Putin for decades, and obtained ""financial benefit"" and ""preferential treatment"" from that relationship.
One of the companies Abramovich co-owns, the government claims, may even have made steel for Russian tanks. That has been denied by the firm and Abramovich - who has always rejected suggestions of links with the Russian President. 
But given the horrors Putin has unleashed on Ukraine, many are appalled that so many Chelsea fans remain loyal to the oligarch, and concerned at what that reveals about football's priorities and values.

As if the sight of a pro-Abramovich banner at Stamford Bridge was not uncomfortable enough for the game, the manager of Newcastle United then found himself (again) facing questions over Saudi Arabia's human rights record at his post-match press conference.

'It's only right that I stick to football' - Howe
Eddie Howe was asked about the 81 executions the country had just carried out in a single day.
Howe insisted he would ""stick to football"" and many Newcastle fans seem to think such questions are unfair. Certainly it would be better if a representative of the club's majority owners PIF was available to be asked such questions. Similarly, there would have perhaps been more transparency and accountability at Chelsea if Abramovich had granted the occasional interview over the years where he could have faced questions over his motives for owning the club.  
Many feel such questions to Howe are both inevitable and entirely legitimate when - despite the club's insistence of separation between the club's majority owner sovereign wealth fund PIF that controls the club and the Saudi state - PIF is chaired by the country's ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman himself. 
Or when - just as Chelsea executives have asked manager Thomas Tuchel to field questions about the sanctioning of the owner - no-one from PIF gives an interview or press conference themselves. Or when a Saudi flag was spotted among Newcastle fans at Stamford Bridge. And when Saudi Arabia is itself engaged in a war - in Yemen, in which, according to Human Rights Watch, external ""all parties… have committed serious violations of the laws of war, many of which may amount to war crimes…""
Many Newcastle fans in turn point to the £11bn of annual trade the UK does with Saudi Arabia - including being one of the world's largest sellers of arms to the kingdom - and ask why football should be held to a higher standard. 
They ask why investment into a club such as theirs should be blocked when the government is happy to do business with Saudi Arabia in other industries. Indeed, this week the Prime Minister himself is reportedly poised to visit Riyadh, external for talks on oil. 
Chelsea fans can point to the way Russian finance was warmly welcomed into London over the last two decades, and ask why they should be singled out. 
As Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp asked last week: ""Did anyone really care when Roman Abramovich came to Chelsea? Did anyone really care when Newcastle got taken over? Do supporters really care?""
Klopp did say football needs to ""think more about where the money is coming from"", adding: ""It is pretty obvious where the money is coming from. Everyone knew it, but we accepted it. That's our fault. It is society's fault so we accepted it. Now we cannot accept it anymore and so we punish them. It is not Chelsea's fault. Not at all.""
'We all have to start waking up - it is a point in our history'
Others of course insist none of this makes it right, and that football clubs - as vital cultural and community assets - should be afforded greater protection than other businesses. And also that, because of the global profile and prestige they offer owners, there now needs to be much greater recognition of the risk that they are exploited for 'sportswashing' purposes. 
""We've got to think now about how we protect our assets,"" says Simon Chadwick, global professor of sport at the Emlyon Business School in Paris. 
""As a country we need to engage in a much more informed debate about what we want from football, to set aside personal interests and rivalries and decide as a community what we like.""
Chadwick accepts football club ownership simply reflects the country's willingness over decades to open itself up to investors from across the world as a means of maintaining status, wealth and power. 
But he also believes English football has been slow to address unstoppable forces connected to globalisation, digitalisation and the environment, with countries in the East trying to use energy revenues as the basis for diversifying their economies and extending their political influence across the world. 
""This is a point in our history,"" he warns. ""We all have to start waking up because what we all realise is that football has become deeply embedded within a geopolitical network that is very hard to extricate oneself from.
""What it's done is to raise awareness that we're exposed and vulnerable to the advances of other countries.""
It is not just Chelsea, of course, who have been exposed by Russia's invasion. 
Everton have suspended their commercial sponsorship arrangements with Russian companies part-owned by oligarch Alisher Usmanov after he had his assets frozen by the European Union because they say he is ""a pro-Kremlin oligarch with particularly close ties"" to Putin. Usmanov has denied this and vowed a legal challenge. 
Manchester United have had to drop their sponsorship deal with airline Aeroflot. Uefa has had to do the same with state-controlled energy giant Gazprom.
Fifa meanwhile faces renewed accusations it may have helped embolden Putin when, despite the annexation of Crimea in 2014, the Russian president was able to use the 2018 World Cup to project a positive image of his country to the world. 
The sense of overdue reckoning that English football is now experiencing will intensify this week when senior executives from both the FA and Premier League - along with the Sports Minister - are questioned by MPs on the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport committee about the role of Russian money in both the ownership and sponsorship of clubs. 
But as Newcastle United have discovered, the conflict in Ukraine will force questions about the motivation of investors from other countries too, as well as a focus on the source of funds. 
Since the UAE joined China and India by refusing to back a US resolution at the UN Security Council condemning Russia's invasion, there has been renewed scrutiny on Manchester City's Abu Dhabi owners. 
City are of course majority owned by the investment group of Sheikh Mansour, a member of the Abu Dhabi ruling family and deputy prime minister of the UAE. 
Will Pep Guardiola - like Howe - now be asked to comment on the UAE's role in the Saudi-led military operation in Yemen? Or the country's human rights record? 
Asked last week for his thoughts on Chelsea, Guardiola said he would wait to be more informed before giving his opinion: ""We are the face of the club, we are here every few days. You have to understand there are subjects we don't know and don't have an hour lesson to speak and talk about. 
""It looks like we have to know absolutely everything. We are human beings - I don't know.""
City, like Newcastle and Chelsea, reject any suggestion of 'sportswashing' of course. 
City, for instance, can point to the profit they made in their most recent accounts, and insist they are now a sustainable organisation, with Abu Dhabi's investment helping to regenerate the east of Manchester. They point out that the club has Chinese and American investors as well as the controlling stake from the UAE. 
Similarly, Newcastle United have vowed to invest in the wider north-east of England region. 
But it feels significant that the DCMS committee has warned on Tuesday it will also ask ""if the government is concerned about investments in UK sport from other nations with poor human rights records such as China and Saudi Arabia"".

Managers 'have to know everything' - Guardiola
What could happen next?
The Sports Minister Nigel Huddlestone is bound to be asked where the government is up to with its response to the fan-led review his predecessor Tracey Crouch published last year in the wake of the proposed Super League and a series of clubs falling into financial difficulties. 
He is also likely to be asked whether the events of recent weeks have made it more likely the government will accept in full Crouch's recommendation for an independent football regulator with the power to rule on a beefed-up Owners and Directors Test - which the former minister believes would have ""stress-tested"" the Saudi takeover more than at present. 
Huddlestone could also be asked how the government feels about football being used to improve a country's image and if it is prepared to consider making a special case of clubs, barring potential owners with direct links to states, governments and rulers, and risk sacrificing the investment and jobs that have accompanied such acquisitions? 
And indeed whether the model that will now be applied to Chelsea - with the government effectively needing to approve the new owner - should now be used for all future takeovers? The benefit of greater fan ownership could also be discussed.
Premier League policy chief Helen MacNamara, who is also appearing in front of MPs, will no doubt be asked if the clubs who so fiercely opposed Crouch's idea of an independent regulator have now grudgingly accepted something needs to change.
That could include a human rights component being incorporated into its owners and directors test, as demanded by Amnesty, as the league conducts its own review of its regulations - and whether owners should be mandated to engage with the media and fans in the interests of accountability and transparency. 
Football - when challenged over its sustainability and governance - has proved resistant to change and outside interference. Even after the Super League controversy, the FA pushed back against an independent regulator, its chair Debbie Hewitt insisting, external it could be trusted to take on the role.
But there now seems to be renewed momentum behind those who believe Chelsea's predicament - and the unedifying mood surrounding Sunday's match, set against the appalling suffering in Ukraine - is a warning that must be heeded by the game, and that this time, something has to change.

A persistent cough Julie Smith thought was Covid turned out to be terminal cancer
Thinking she had coronavirus, Julie Smith took four Covid tests because she had been suffering with a persistent cough and had lost her sense of taste.
The grandmother went to her GP after returning from a family holiday to Butlins - but tests showed Julie actually had terminal lung cancer. 
""From 'you're not ill' and then to be diagnosed with all this, I just can't believe it,"" said the 73-year-old.
Doctors now want targeted screening in Wales to catch lung cancer cases early.
Trials show it can reduce deaths by 20% and one leading cancer charity has said Wales was ""lagging far behind England"" because the NHS in England has offered lung health checks, external in some areas since 2019. 
Artificial intelligence finds lung cancer
Woman with incurable cancer had treatment delayed
Longer waiting times put cancer patients at risk
It is being considered by the Welsh government, although lung cancer screening has not been recommended by the UK National Screening Committee.
But consultants in Wales think it could save people like Julie.
'I had nothing wrong apart from a cough'
Julie Smith had numerous tests and scans revealed a mass on her left lung
And if Julie, who stopped smoking in 1989, was in one of those areas in England, she would have been eligible for a scan which might have saved her life.
""We went to Butlins with the family, I went on the big water slide and everything and then the cough started,"" said the grandmother-of-four from Pontypridd, in Rhondda Cynon Taf.
""I had nothing wrong with me apart from a cough and then a couple of weeks later my taste started to go. I'd had all my Covid injections so I thought 'well I'll be alright, but I'll just have Covid'.""
Julie Smith and her granddaughter on the carousel on their family trip
Julie had started to cough in September 2021 after a break in Minehead, but her Covid tests came back clear.
The retired hospital housekeeper went to the doctors after neighbours heard her persistent cough during the night through the walls of their terraced house.
'I've had a lot of tears'
After further scans, Julie's lung cancer was diagnosed - but it had spread to her lymph nodes and bones so treatment to cure it was no longer possible.
""I had a little tear but was in shock,"" Julie said, recalling receiving her diagnoses. 
""My husband was sobbing, as were my son and daughter. But I've had a lot of tears since.""
She added: ""None of us can believe it.""
Julie's husband Jimmy has supported her through her diagnosis
The diagnosis came just four months after her ex-husband, and the father of her two children, had died of lung cancer.
Julie has had chemotherapy, external and is now undergoing immunotherapy, external - treatment which uses the immune system to help fight the cancer - in an effort to prolong her life.
Julie says her taste has been affected, especially when eating sweet things like ice cream
""I worry about the children and how they're all going to cope,"" Julie added. ""It's been so frightening, I just only hope with immunotherapy that I will have a lot longer.""
Other cancers have a better survival rate because they are usually picked up earlier, but often lung cancer symptoms don't develop until the cancer has advanced.
Julie is now backing calls for targeted lung screening in Wales so other families do not have to go through what her family is going through.
""What was frightening is that I had no symptoms,"" she said. ""I had nothing wrong with me except this cough. You just don't know you've got it so screening would be brilliant.""
How dangerous is lung cancer?
Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer death around the world, with 2.1 million people diagnosed in 2020 and 1.8 million deaths.
It is also the biggest cause of cancer deaths in the UK, external, killing more than 35,000 people a year - about a fifth of all UK cancer deaths.
Experts say the most dangerous thing about lung cancer is patients often do not have symptoms until it is too late to be cured.

What are the symptoms of lung cancer? 
There are usually no signs or symptoms in the early stages of lung cancer but they do develop as the condition worsens.
The main symptoms of lung cancer, external include a cough that does not go away after two or three weeks and gets worse, reoccurring chest infections, aches or pain when breathing or coughing and persistent breathlessness and tiredness.
Source: NHS
Screening is available in 23 areas of England to people aged between 55 and 74 who smoke, or have smoked.
One leading cancer charity has criticised the Welsh government for not starting a pilot in Wales already. 
""In Wales, we are yet to get off the ground,"" said Tenovus Cancer Care chief executive Judi Rhys.
""Even though we have the go-ahead for an operational pilot, that's not going to start until later this year. We are lagging far behind England"".
'I owe my life to lung cancer screening'
Jo Shoba said she owed her life to screening after stage one lung cancer was detected during a health check in December 2019 but is now ""cancer-free"".
Jo Shoba had her first grandchild after lung cancer screening ""saved her life""
""I was perfectly fit and healthy with no symptoms whatsoever, so it was very surprising,"" said the 72-year-old from Liverpool who smoked as a teenager.
""I totally owe my life to the screening. My first grandchild is now five months old and that's such a gift."" 
Leading doctors believe effective screening could cut lung cancer deaths by a fifth and a pilot is currently being developed to test how a national rollout could be implemented.
Dr Sinan Eccles is shaping Wales' lung cancer screening programme
""Bowel cancer and breast cancer have screening programmes and they've helped reduce deaths,"" said Sinan Eccles, Wales' clinical lead for developing lung cancer screening.
""We want to start making a dent in those lung cancer deaths in Wales by screening and curing more cases.
""We've had trials in America, and then in Europe, showing a 20% reduction in lung cancer mortality, which, when you're talking about the biggest cancer killer that we've got in Wales, is huge.""
Mr Eccles, a lung cancer consultant in south Wales, wants to start by developing screening pilots in deprived areas of Wales, where lung cancer cases and deaths are higher. 
'Treatments are helping people live longer'
Although lung cancer deaths are high, doctors say developments in treatments can extend the lives of patients.
""We're seeing cancer outcomes now I would never have dreamt of five to 10 years ago,"" said Dr Mick Button, lung cancer lead at Cardiff's Velindre cancer hospital. 
""Some people are on immunotherapy for two years with their lung cancer and at the end of that they may have very little sign of cancer in their body, no symptoms and they can live for a lot longer.""
The Welsh government has said that although lung cancer screening has not been recommended by the UK National Screening Committee, it is ""under consideration"" and a pilot was being developed. 
""We have invested significant sums in diagnostic equipment and are committed to improving cancer outcomes in Wales,"" said a government spokesperson.
""We have also published our plan for recovering NHS services, including cancer care, backed by nearly £250m of additional funding.""

451,451,How many refugees have fled Ukraine and where are they going?,"Mon, 14 Mar 2022 16:25:09 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-60555472,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-60555472?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,The UN says four million people may try to escape the war in Ukraine.,"How many Ukrainian refugees are there and where have they gone?
At least 12 million people have fled their homes since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the United Nations (UN) says. 
More than five million have left for neighbouring countries, while seven million people are still thought to be displaced inside Ukraine itself. 
However, hundreds of thousands of refugees have returned to their home country - especially to cities like Kyiv.
Where are refugees going?
The UN says that, as of 4 July, external, more than 5.2 million refugees from Ukraine have been recorded across Europe. More than 3.5 million have applied for temporary residence in another country: 
Russia: (estimated) 1,412,425 Ukrainian refugees recorded
Poland: 1,194,642 
Moldova: 82,700
Romania: 83,321
Slovakia: 79,770
Hungary: 25,800
Belarus: 9,820 
Others have moved on to other countries, especially those who crossed into Poland, Hungary and Slovakia. These nations have open borders with other EU states, external. 
The UN says there are more than 867,000 Ukrainians in Germany, almost 382,768 in the Czech Republic and 141,562 in Italy. 
Some Ukrainians travelled to Russia from the regions of Luhansk and Donetsk, which are now mostly in the hands of pro-Russian separatist forces. 
President Vladimir Putin said his forces evacuated 140,000 civilians from Mariupol, external and insisted none of them was forced to go to Russia. However, volunteer groups, external say they have helped thousands of Ukrainians leave Russia.
What help are countries offering refugees?
The EU has granted Ukrainians the automatic right to stay and work throughout its 27 member nations for up to three years. 
Refugees are housed in reception centres if they can't stay with friends or relatives. They are given food and medical care, and information about onward travel.
They are entitled to social welfare payments and access to housing, medical treatment and schools.
Poland, one of the countries which has taken the highest number of refugees, and Moldova, which has the largest concentration of refugees by population, have asked for additional support. 
Hundreds of refugees were housed in this athletics centre in Moldova
How many people are returning to Ukraine?
The UN says that as of 21 June, there have been over 3 million ""cross-border movements"" back into Ukraine, external, but says this number does not refer to individual refugees.
Ukraine's border force had previously said people were crossing back into the country at a rate of about 30,000 a day.
Some are returning to areas of Ukraine such as the capital Kyiv, which were threatened by Russian army advances at the start of the war, but which are now considered safer. 
In May, Kyiv mayor Vitali Klitschko said the city's population was back to two-thirds of its pre-war level, external. 
Where are people fleeing inside Ukraine?
The UN's International Organisation for Migration (IOM) said in May that more than seven million people remain internally displaced, external:
27% of refugees were from the Kharkiv region
16% from Kyiv 
16% from the Donetsk region in eastern Ukraine
24% indicated their homes had been damaged or attacked in the war
The IOM estimates that more than half of the people who are internally displaced are women. Many are particularly vulnerable because they are pregnant or have small children, have a disability or are a victim of violence.
The UN is working alongside other organisations to provide cash, food and other supplies. 
The UN estimates that about eight million people are displaced inside Ukraine
What is the UK doing to help Ukrainian refugees?
The UK introduced a family visa scheme, external for Ukrainians who have an immediate or extended family member in the UK.
After the government response was criticised, it launched the Homes for Ukraine scheme to allow those without relatives in the UK to settle. 
People in the UK can nominate an individual or family to stay with them rent-free for at least six months.
Refugees who come via the scheme can live and work in the UK for up to three years, and get access to healthcare, welfare and schools.
Applications are made online, external, and both hosts and refugees are vetted. Hosts receive £350 a month.
Many families who have applied to be sponsors have complained that the system is too slow and complicated.
As of 28 June, the government had issued 142,500 Ukrainian visas, external out of 161,500 applications received, and as of 27 June, 86,600 visa holders had arrived in the UK.

Cameron Smith claimed the biggest win of his career as a Players Championship that featured storm delays and near freezing temperatures concluded in warm sunshine at TPC Sawgrass on Monday.
He becomes the fifth Australian to win the PGA Tour's flagship event and takes home $3.6m, the largest prize in golf.
Smith holed 10 birdies in a six-under-par 66 to win on 13 under, one ahead of India's Anirban Lahiri in Florida.
England's Paul Casey pushed Smith as he carded a 69 to end third on 11 under.
Players Championship reaction
Full leaderboard (external), external
""I just played a really, really good round of golf in difficult conditions around Sawgrass. Shot 69 with one bogey and some breaks that didn't go my way,"" said 44-year-old Casey.
""You have to tip your cap at Cam, who played phenomenal golf. He won this tournament. There was no losing it, he flat out won it and you have to respect that.""
It was a terrific battle between the pair, with Smith, who lives in nearby Jacksonville and enjoyed the greater support, holing four consecutive birdie putts to race clear of the field and a fifth came at his sixth hole to get to 12 under.
But the momentum started to shift on the par-four seventh as Casey rolled in his first birdie putt to get within two as Smith bogeyed.
And the lead was eradicated on the par-five ninth, with Smith carding a third successive bogey, while Casey again birdied as both started the back nine on nine under.
Elsewhere, pressure was coming from American Keegan Bradley, who had four birdies from the ninth to get to 10 under, while Scotland's Russell Knox, who also lives in Jacksonville, birdied three of his first four holes to get to nine under before fading with bogeys at the fifth and seventh.
Round-three leader Lahiri reached 10 under after seven holes but a double bogey on the par-three eighth looked ruinous for the Indian, ranked 322 in the world. However, he hit back with an eagle on the 11th to get right back in the hunt on 11 under.
Smith was on another birdie run though, holing four in succession from the 10th to get to 13 under and put daylight between himself and the field.
Casey was hanging in there, with birdies on the 11th and 12th to get to 11 under but his luck ran out on the par-five 16th. After a monstrous drive, his ball ended up in a divot, preventing him from going for the green in two, with the threat of water to the right of the green.
""It was the best tee shot I have hit all week on that hole,"" said Casey. ""Cameron had hit it into the trees and I thought the door was open. I wanted to go for the green but there were too many variables and too many risks.
""You need a little bit of luck sometimes, don't you? That wasn't very good luck, was it? Deep down I wanted to go for it out of that lie, but it felt too risky. It would have been brave, but maybe foolish to try to go for it.""
Casey had to settle for par, as did Smith and the world number 10 further extended his lead with a terrific birdie on the iconic par-three 17th after hitting his tee shot to four feet, although he admitted: ""I'd be lying if I said I was aiming there. I was aiming 10 feet left of where it went.""
Lahiri, in the group behind, also birdied the 17th to move within two and he watched from the 18th fairway as Smith, who had inexplicably hit his second from the trees into the water, holed a short putt for a bogey.
That left Lahiri needing a birdie to force a play-off, but he was visibly annoyed with his approach, which came up short of the green and when his birdie chip pulled up a foot short of the hole, Smith could finally celebrate.
""This hasn't sunk in yet,"" said the 28-year-old. ""I feel as though one of these big ones was the next step for me. 
""I have knocked on the door a few times and I felt it was my time. I'm playing the best I've ever played, I hit lots of quality golf shots and did not back down.""
Stormy week with sunny ending
The 40th anniversary of the first Players Championship to be held at the iconic purpose-built Stadium Course will live long in the memory.
The first round alone took 54 hours to complete as five inches of rain deluged the course with thunderstorms forcing fans to be evacuated from the course on Thursday and Friday.
And the strong winds that blew away the storms that had delayed Saturday's start wreaked havoc, with 35mph gusts leading to high scoring for those unfortunate to be out there. Sunday's play started in 2C temperatures, around 25C cooler than the practice days.
After the end of the second round, the top 10 players on the leaderboard had all gone out in the morning wave on Thursday.
England's Lee Westwood, who was among the later starters and therefore playing in the worst conditions, echoed the thoughts of many others in his half of the draw when he posted on Twitter: ""I haven't seen this big a discrepancy between morning and afternoon waves in a good few years.""
He shot a one-over 73 in the opening round but an 80 in Saturday's wind.
The weather delays pushed the tournament into a Monday finish for the first time since 2005 and the eighth overall. All the Monday finishes have occurred in March. The Players was held in May for 12 years until returning to its earlier date in 2019.
The rain briefly returned on Monday but the final round was largely played out in warm, sunny conditions as Smith picked up his fifth PGA Tour win, to move up to sixth in the world rankings and join Steve Elkington (1991, 1997), Greg Norman (1994), Adam Scott (2004) and Jason Day (2016) as Australian winners of this event.

Bernardo Silva missed one of Manchester City's best chances from close range
Manchester City midfielder Bernardo Silva said his side are ""still in a better position than Liverpool"" despite drawing with Crystal Palace on Monday.
Premier League leaders City moved four points ahead of title rivals Liverpool, but missed chances at Selhurst Park saw it end in a goalless draw on Monday.
The result means Liverpool will cut City's lead to one point if they beat Arsenal away from home on Wednesday.
""We couldn't score and we should've scored,"" Silva told Sky Sports.
""Nine games to go, but it's still better to be in our position than in Liverpool's and they have to play in our stadium so it's going to be exciting.""
City have played one game more than Liverpool and the two sides will meet each other at Etihad Stadium in April.
Silva added: ""It's never easy to play at any team away in the Premier League. It's always better to win than draw and we wanted to have an advantage of six points over Liverpool.""

Crystal Palace 0-0 Manchester City: Manchester City 'struggled' to score goals - Guardiola
Silva failed to convert a fruitful opening late on, poking Jack Grealish's pass across goal narrowly wide on an off-night for City's forwards.
But Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola still praised his side's performance at full-time.
""Luck doesn't exist in football. We have to score goals and we didn't do it,"" he told BBC Match of the Day.
""We played to score goals and concede few. We struggled a little bit.
""The team that was there today was there before and will be there in the next game. I am very pleased with the performance and the way we played.""
Eight weeks ago, Manchester City's lead at the top of the Premier League was 13 points - although Liverpool, in third at the time, had two games in hand. 
After this draw in south London, the gap is now four points.
""We never had 13 points, [Liverpool] had two games in hand,"" Silva added to BBC Radio 5 Live.
""Now it's four and they have one game in hand. We had very tough fixtures - Tottenham, Manchester United, Everton, Southampton, Crystal Palace. We're going to keep having difficult games. We're still top.""

""When you play against the quality of players they have, you need a bit of luck at times - and at times we were lucky - but you also need to perform as well.
""These three teams [Manchester City, Liverpool and Chelsea] are in the best four or five in Europe.
""You look at how they play, they make the game look easy, they have the quality, the technical ability to make the right decisions. It will be a really exciting end to the season for the title.""

454,454,Nadal beats GB's Evans at Indian Wells to continue unbeaten run,"Mon, 14 Mar 2022 23:37:26 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/tennis/60742864,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/tennis/60742864?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,Rafael Nadal extends his unbeaten run in 2022 to 17 matches by beating Britain's Dan Evans at Indian Wells.,"Indian Wells: Cameron Norrie wins but Dan Evans beaten by Rafael Nadal
Norrie (left) is ranked 12th in the world while Evans is 29th
Defending men's champion Cameron Norrie has reached the last 16 at Indian Wells but fellow Briton Dan Evans was knocked out by Rafael Nadal.
Norrie, 26, beat 30-year-old Georgian Nikoloz Basilashvili 3-6 6-3 6-1 in a repeat of the men's 2021 final.
Spaniard Nadal, 35, who has not lost in 2022, overcame 31-year-old Evans 7-5 6-3 as he secured a 17th straight win.
Russia's Daniil Medvedev was beaten in the last 32 by Gael Monfils and will lose his world number one ranking.
Norrie will play Jenson Brooksby in the fourth round after the 21-year-old American caused an upset by knocking out Stefanos Tsitsipas 1-6 6-3 6-2.
""Jenson's not the most traditional player. He's a tricky player, and he's got good hands,"" said Norrie.
""I've always wanted to play him and feel what it's like to play him. I'm looking forward to that, and it's a little bit of a rivalry.
""He went to Baylor, which is Texas Christian University's rival school (where Norrie studied) so hopefully I can get him on that one.""
Nadal is still unbeaten in 2022 having won the Melbourne Summer Set, Australian Open and Mexican Open
Evans started well against Nadal and broke early to lead 3-1 and 4-2 but the world number four broke serve twice to win the opening set.
An early break in set two was enough to see Nadal go on and take the match.
Nadal, who staged an epic fightback to beat American Sebastian Korda in the previous round, is the man to beat at the moment - as Evans acknowledged.
""It's tough to explain the feeling you get against him,"" said Evans. ""He played very well, I thought, he was very aggressive and he didn't really give me much chance to come forward.
""I was happy with the way I played. It's a terrible match-up for me - it would be nice to have a double-handed backhand in this situation.""
Nadal will play American Reilly Opelka in the next round after he beat Canada's Denis Shapovalov 6-7 (4-7) 6-4 6-4.
""I have been playing after a couple of games better and better. That is important for confidence and playing against a good opponent like Dan is good for me,"" said Nadal.
""I think the match at the beginning was difficult. He put me under pressure going to the net. It was not easy to put him in tough positions. I hit a couple of important passing shots at important moments.""
Medvedev's defeat, meanwhile, means his position at the top of the rankings will span just three weeks and Serbia's Novak Djokovic will become world number one again from Monday.
Frenchman Monfils secured a 6-4 3-6 6-1 win by converting his sixth match point and celebrated his surprise victory over the Russian by pointing to his Ukrainian wife Elina Svitolina in the stands.
""I'm in my zone and I'm a tough opponent for anyone,"" said 35-year-old Monfils, who will play Spain's Carlos Alcaraz in the last 16.
""It's been a long time since I've beaten a world number one, so I'm pretty happy. I've had a strong start to the year, I felt strong and was moving well.""
Alcaraz, seeded 19, advanced to the last 16 with a confident 6-2 6-0 demolition of compatriot Roberto Bautista Agut, the 15th seed.
Elsewhere on Monday in the women's draw, Greece's Maria Sakkari, looking to build on a breakout 2021 which included two Grand Slam semi-finals appearances, reached the last 16 by overwhelming the Czech Republic's two-time Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova 6-3 6-0.
Czech Republic's Marketa Vondrousova beat Estonian fourth seed Anett Kontaveit 3-6 7-5 7-6 (7-5) in a match that lasted two hours and 50 minutes.
Defending women's champion Paula Badosa was pushed in the first set of her match against fellow Spaniard Sara Sorribes Tormo before earning a 7-6 (7-4) 6-1 victory.
Leylah Fernandez, who lost to Emma Raducanu in last year's US Open final, made it into the last 16 with a 6-1 3-6 6-3 win over Shelby Rogers, while Elena Rybakina secured a 6-3 6-4 win against Victoria Azarenka.
Azarenka, who had right shoulder heavily taped and a sleeve placed on her right arm, crouched down and cried after a double fault in the fifth game of the second set.
The umpire asked if she needed medical attention but she continued before losing in straight sets.
'A bridge too far for Evans' - analysis
BBC Sport tennis correspondent Russell Fuller:
Evans made a fast start - coming forward and putting a lot of pressure on Nadal in the early stages.
But gradually Nadal reeled him in, and he made life as difficult for someone with a single handed backhand as he always does.
These gritty slow courts, combined with the thin desert air, always take some getting used to - but Nadal is now working his way into the tournament ominously.

Scottish Cup highlights: Dundee United 0-3 Celtic
Celtic will face Rangers in the Scottish Cup semi-finals after seeing off a battling Dundee United.
A deflected shot from Callum McGregor gave the visitors a half-time lead, while a dreadful blunder from goalkeeper Ben Siegrist resulted in a tap-in for Giorgos Giakoumakis.
The striker grabbed a late second goal, helping on an effort from substitute Karamoko Dembele.
United pressed valiantly but posed little threat in attack at Tannadice.
The win stretches the Scottish Premiership leaders' run of unbeaten domestic games to 30.
Celtic, who have lifted the cup a record 40 times, join Rangers, Hearts and Hibernian in the last four - the first time the Glasgow and Edinburgh clubs have all made it this far together.
And, with the League Cup already in the trophy room and a three-point lead in the league, fans' thoughts will be turning to a potential fifth treble in six seasons.
Follow radio & text coverage
Amid the early hustle and bustle, Celtic forward Daizen Maeda brushed the roof of the net from a long way out.
The breakthrough came on 12 minutes when McGregor ran on to a short corner and let fly from the edge of the penalty area. Nicky Clark stuck a leg out in an attempt to block, but only succeeded in diverting the ball away from Siegrist.
The goal knocked the stuffing out of the home side for a while, as did the loss of energetic midfielder Ian Harkes to injury, but a wild challenge from Reo Hatate on Kieran Freeman reignited United after half an hour.
However, an increase in aggression and work-rate did not stem the flow of Celtic attacks and there was a moment of controversy when the visitors thought they had scored a second goal.
Maeda squeezed a shot in from close range but the ball had come his way via the arm of Giakoumakis. It wasn't a deliberate action from the Greek, with the changed rulebook therefore suggesting the goal should have stood.
Soon after, McGregor sent a fizzing effort just wide of the top corner and a swivelling Giakoumakis then volleyed off target.
The hosts continued to graft commendably after the interval, although they were undone by too many errant passes.
Just when it looked like Celtic had been knocked off their stride, they were handed a gift by Siegrist, who fumbled a cross from Maeda at the feet of Giakoumakis and the striker could not miss.
Thereafter, Ange Postecoglou's side managed to keep United at bay without too much fuss and found a late goal when Dembele's deflected shot looped up nicely for Giakoumakis to nudge home.
Man of the match - Callum McGregor
Celtic captain Callum McGregor knocked in the opener and helped his midfield overcome determined opponents with a typically assured display
What the managers said
Dundee United's Thomas Courts: ""We stuck to the task but probably just didn't work the goalkeeper enough and we didn't give our fans - who I thought were tremendous throughout - anything to really shout about and make a real game of it.""
Celtic's Ange Postecoglou: ""We didn't really give them any opportunities to get near our goal. We scored three goals away from home and I thought we handled the atmosphere well. Away from home, a 3-0 win in a knock-out game is pretty comprehensive.""

Aymeric Laporte had a brilliant chance to open the scoring in the first half
Manchester City missed their chance to go six points clear at the top of the Premier League as they were held by a resilient Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park. 
City dominated proceedings, twice hitting the woodwork, while defender Aymeric Laporte failed to find the net with the goal at his mercy in the first half.
The result means Liverpool can cut City's lead to one point by beating Arsenal on Wednesday.
In front of a boisterous crowd, Palace frustrated their opponents although they created little themselves going forward.
A point keeps them 11th as they boosted their own hopes of a top-half finish.

Crystal Palace 0-0 Manchester City: Manchester City 'struggled' to score goals - Guardiola
Eight weeks ago, Manchester City's lead at the top of the Premier League was 13 points - although Liverpool, in third at the time, had two games in hand. After this draw in south London, the gap is now four points. 
Liverpool have one game in hand over their rivals, with the pair still to play each other at Etihad Stadium in April.
Pep Guardiola's side were motivated from the off against Palace, with Joao Cancelo striking the post from range after 30 minutes and Laporte firing the rebound off target with the goal at his mercy.
Captain Kevin de Bruyne struck the base of the post midway through the second half, while Riyad Mahrez forced Palace keeper Vicente Guaita into a fine one-handed save on the follow-up.
And Bernardo Silva also failed to convert a fruitful opening late on, poking Jack Grealish's pass across goal narrowly wide on an off-night for City's forwards.
The champions, who came in to this match having won 16 of their past 18 games, were made to rue their missed chances, and their players cut frustrated figures at the full-time whistle.
The Blues have failed to score against Palace in both league games this season, with the reverse fixture in October finishing 2-0 to Palace.

Palace 'fought for the luck' - Patrick Vieira
Palace are now unbeaten in their past five matches and go to within one point of 10th-placed Southampton as they continue to push for the top half.
Patrick Vieira's team were happy to sit back at Selhurst Park, and had a number of half-chances on the break, through Wilfried Zaha and Michael Olise in the first half and Conor Gallagher after the restart.
Coming into this fixture, the hosts had picked up only one point from a possible 12 across their four home league fixtures in 2022.
But they were encouraged by their loud support and rode their luck at times, holding on against a usually ruthless Manchester City side.
Both sides now turn their attention to the FA Cup quarter-finals next Sunday as Palace host Everton and City visit Southampton.

The Slovenian, Polish and Czech prime ministers, together with Poland's ruling party leader, took the long journey from Warsaw
Ukraine has praised the courage of three European leaders who made a long, hazardous journey by rail from Poland to Kyiv in a show of support as the city came under further Russian attack.
The prime ministers of Poland, Slovenia and the Czech Republic met Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky on Tuesday evening as a curfew began in Kyiv.
Afterwards, the Czech leader told Ukrainians that they were ""not alone"".
They are the first Western leaders to visit Ukraine since Russia invaded.
""We admire your brave fight,"" Petr Fiala wrote in a tweet, external. ""We know that you're also fighting for our lives. You're not alone, our countries stand by your side.""
""Your visit is a powerful expression of support for Ukraine,"" Mr Zelensky is quoted as telling the group.
The European leaders held a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in Kyiv
On Wednesday, Poland's Mateusz Morawiecki tweeted, external that Ukraine was reminding Europe what courage was. It was time for ""sluggish and decayed"" Europe to reawaken and ""break through her wall of indifference and give Ukraine hope"", he said.
The leaders had arrived back in Poland on Wednesday morning, a Polish government spokesperson said.
Peacekeeping mission suggested
Also on the trip was Jaroslaw Kaczynski, the head of Poland's ruling party, and he called for the creation of a Nato or international peacekeeping mission that ""will also be able to defend itself and operate in Ukraine"".
However, one of his advisers later clarified that Mr Kaczynski had not been calling for Nato to get involved militarily.
""Here the position is unchanged. Neither Poland nor Nato are taking, or will take part, in the war,"" Michal Dworczyk told Polish Radio.
Ukraine's Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal wrote on Twitter that ""devastating"" sanctions against Russia had been discussed during the meeting in Kyiv, including the ""recognition of Russia as a sponsor of terrorism"".
Explosions heard during meeting
As the talks took place on Tuesday evening, loud explosions could be heard from fighting on the western edge of the capital city. 
The European Union said the politicians were not carrying any particular mandate, but that leaders in Brussels were aware of the trip, as it was mentioned during an informal EU summit in Versailles, France, last week. 
Poland's Deputy Foreign Minister Marcin Przydacz admitted the trip was risky, but said it was ""worth taking for the sake of values"". He said they had told the Russians the visit was taking place. 
All three leaders on the trip to Kyiv have been vocal supporters of Ukraine in recent weeks. Slovenia's prime minister said last week that the EU should send a strong message that Ukraine will eventually be granted membership.
Czech Foreign Minister Jan Lipavsky said the visit was a strong and important gesture to show solidarity with Ukraine. 
""Ukraine's security is European security; therefore we need to do everything possible to help them survive this sickening barbaric Russian attack,"" he told the BBC.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky met the European leaders in Kyiv
The leaders decided to travel by train because flying by Polish military jet could have been viewed by Russia as dangerously provocative, BBC Europe editor Katya Adler reports. 
Ukraine's president has repeatedly called on Nato to impose a no-fly zone over his country's airspace, but Nato has refused.
Mr Zelensky said Ukrainians now understood they could not join Nato: ""We have heard for years that the doors were open, but we also heard that we could not join. It's a truth and it must be recognised. I am glad that our people are beginning to understand this and rely on themselves and our partners who help us.""

The city was facing a difficult and dangerous moment, he said: ""This is why I ask all Kyivites to get prepared to stay at home for two days, or if the sirens go off, in the shelters.""

Prime Minister Boris Johnson is one of the few western leaders to visit Saudi Arabia since the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi
Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said he raised human rights when meeting Gulf leaders for talks about ending reliance on Russian oil and gas after the invasion of Ukraine.
He discussed energy security and other issues in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates on Wednesday.
He said a global coalition was needed ""to deal with the new reality we face"".
But critics have expressed concerns about the human rights records of the countries.
Last weekend, Saudi Arabia carried out a mass execution of 81 men in one day, and its Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has been implicated in the murder of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018.
On Wednesday, Saudi news agency SPA announced three further executions, in what the Reprieve group described as a ""provocative act"" designed to ""flaunt the Crown Prince's power"".
Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said ""going cap in hand from dictator to dictator is not an energy strategy"".
Hatice Cengiz, the fiancee of Mr Khashoggi, told the BBC Mr Johnson should not be ""doing deals"" with Crown Prince Salman unless he insisted ""on the truth and justice for Jamal's murder"".
Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner told MPs Mr Johnson was on ""a begging mission to the Saudi prince"" after failing to invest in home-grown energy.

Why is turning to Saudi Arabia for oil so controversial?
But Mr Johnson said if western countries wanted to ""avoid being blackmailed"" by Russia's President Vladimir Putin, they needed to move away from using his country's fossil fuels and explore other partnerships.
In the Saudi capital, Riyadh, Mr Johnson told the BBC he raised human rights and ""what we can do to stabilise oil prices"" in his meeting with Crown Prince Salman.
When asked if the recent executions were discussed, Mr Johnson said ""in spite of the news that you've referred to, things are changing in Saudi Arabia"", adding, ""that's why we see value in the partnership"".
Earlier, he pointed towards Saudi Arabia announcing a £1bn investment in green aviation fuel in the UK as ""the kind of thing we want to encourage"".

Mr Johnson landed at Abu Dhabi airport in the UAE, where he was met by British Ambassador to the UAE Patrick Moody.
He then travelled to the Saudi capital, where he met Crown Prince Salman and Saudi ministers.
'Flawed argument'
Recent executions in Saudi Arabia have drawn criticism from MPs and human rights groups.
Tory MP Crispin Blunt said the executions left Mr Johnson with ""exquisite difficulties"" in asking Saudi Arabia for help with oil supplies.
One of the world's largest oil producers and influential on the international stage, Saudi Arabia is ruled by a monarchy which restricts political rights and civil liberties.
The rise of Crown Prince Salman as de-facto ruler in 2017 has seen moves towards liberalising some laws and diversifying the economy.
But the Saudi government's image has been damaged in recent years, particularly by the assassination of the prominent US-based journalist in 2018, Mr Khashoggi.

He was murdered at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. Saudi Arabia said he had been killed in a ""rogue operation"" by a team of agents sent to persuade him to return to the kingdom.
But a UN investigator concluded that Mr Khashoggi was ""the victim of a deliberate, premeditated execution"" for which the Saudi state was responsible. Crown Prince Salman denied any role.

Mohammed bin Salman is asked: ""Did you order the murder of Jamal Khashoggi?""
Mr Khashoggi's fiancee Ms Cengiz, who accompanied him to the entrance of the consulate, said Mr Johnson's rationale for meeting Crown Prince Salman was a ""flawed argument"".
He ""should not run from the arms of one unpredictable tyrant"" to another, she said.
""Johnson must demand to know the truth and to get justice for the brutal killing of Jamal and for all human rights abuses,"" Ms Cengiz said. ""He cannot act as though nothing has happened. This would be so shameful.""
No straightforward options
Opposition parties and some Conservatives too are uneasy about the government's association with Saudi Arabia - and have been for years. 
That's more acute after dozens of executions there a few days ago. 
Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said going cap in hand from dictator to dictator is no substitute for an energy strategy. 
But for the government, handling the fallout of the conflict in Ukraine means what are described as ""hard-headed"" decisions, even if it's ""distasteful"". 
With huge diplomatic and economic forces at play, there are no straightforward options.  
Disentangling Russia's economy from the West's may seem a diplomatic no-brainer, but the cost and complications of doing so simply can't be ignored. 
Read more from Laura here. 
The energy talks come during a global spike in energy prices driven by tight supplies, President Putin's invasion of Ukraine and western attempts to reduce dependence on Russian oil and gas.
Saudi Arabia is the largest producer in the oil cartel Opec and has the spare capacity to help lower prices by increasing supplies.
Mr Johnson was hoping to convince Crown Prince Salman to boost his kingdom's oil production and garner his support for action against Russia.
Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said while the UK did not agree with ""every single policy of Saudi Arabia or the UAE"", they ""do not pose a threat to global security in the way that Vladimir Putin does"".
""We need to bring those countries into the circle of influence of the UK and pull countries away from dependence on Russia,"" she said.
Muted reaction
Saudi Arabia, the UAE and other Gulf states have so far refrained from overtly condemning Russia, although they did vote in favour of a UN resolution denouncing the invasion of Ukraine.
Their muted reaction has caused some consternation among western nations including the UK, Dr Tobias Borck​, a researcher of Middle East security at the RUSI think tank says.
""In the past 10 years this idea has taken hold in the Gulf that the West doesn't stand for anything anymore, that the West is no longer willing to wield its power in the world,"" Dr Borck told the BBC.
He said Mr Johnson's trip was a vital opportunity to rebuild relations with the Gulf states and convey to them why the invasion of Ukraine ""is a watershed moment for European security"".

Keir Starmer says that “going cap-in-hand from dictator to dictator” is not an energy policy.
Meanwhile, Russian attacks on Ukrainian cities continued as the worst war Europe has seen in decades entered its 21st day.
The attacks came as Ukraine and Russia held peace talks, after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky conceded that Nato membership was not on the table, in an apparent concession to Moscow.
Mr Zelensky said the talks were becoming ""more realistic"", while Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said there was ""some hope for compromise"".
The Ukrainian president addressed the US Congress by video link, having made similar appearances in parliaments across Europe, including the UK's.

The invasion of Ukraine has led many Western brands to shun Russia, but some still have outlets open in the country and say they are not able to shut them.
Marks and Spencer, Burger King, and hotel groups Marriott and Accor are restricted by complex franchise deals preventing them from withdrawing.
The firms have outsourced the Russian businesses to third parties and do not own the operations bearing their name.
Together the firms have almost a thousand outlets still open in Russia.
M&S has 48 shops and Burger King has 800 restaurants still open, whilst Marriott and Accor have 28 and 57 hotels open respectively.
The BBC understands the brands are locked into legal franchise agreements, making it difficult for them to remove their name from Russia's High Streets and shopping malls.
A lot of Western firms have held such agreements for decades. For example, Marks and Spencer stores have been operated by a Turkish company called FiBA, which has held the rights to sell the retailer's products across Eastern Europe, since 1999. The retail giant has said it has suspended shipments of its goods to FiBA in response to the war.
Burger King has said its agreements aren't easy to change
Meanwhile, Burger King's owner Restaurant Brands International also told the BBC its restaurants are run by franchisees. These ""long-standing legal agreements are not easily changeable in the foreseeable future,"" it said.
It is understood hotel groups Marriott, IHG and French chain Accor, which has Ibis and Novotel among its brands, are all operating in Russia under similar deals.
Marriott told the BBC its hotels in Russia were owned by third parties but said it would ""continue to evaluate the ability for these hotels to remain open"", suggesting it was looking into its franchise agreements.
Franchising is a business method of distributing products or services. It involves a franchisor, a company which has established the brand's name, and a franchisee, a company which pays a fee for the right to do business under the franchisor's name and sell its products.
Graeme Payne, a specialist in UK and international franchising at law firm Bird&Bird, told the BBC franchising was useful to Western brands who want to enter markets in different countries, but do not have local knowledge, money, or ability to enter them.
Growing numbers of firms pull back from Russia
""You would as a member of the public… think why don't they just close their stores? But just from a pure business and contractual perspective, it's very difficult to do so without some far reaching legal consequences,"" said Mr Payne.
Those consequences could have serious financial implications for Western businesses, who could be sued by franchisees if they did break any agreement, which are often 10 or more years long.
Victoria Hobbs, a partner at Bird&Bird who deals with franchise disputes, told the BBC if a franchise owner was found to have links to Russian President Vladimir Putin or had been sanctioned, then from a UK perspective, a deal could be terminated.
However, Ms Hobbs said although agreements often have a clause that states ""if the franchisee is doing something to damage our reputation we can terminate"", the problem currently in Russia is that many franchisees themselves are not doing anything wrong.
""It is quite challenging for them because, from an English law perspective, they don't really have a right to bring the agreement to an end - that's the problem,"" she said.
Even if a brand managed to succeed in getting a UK court judgment against a franchise in Russia, ""the Russian courts wouldn't enforce it"", according to John Pratt, a partner at the largest team of specialist franchise lawyers in Europe.
In the meantime, the firms are trying to do what they can to help with the situation and all have announced support for Ukraine following Russia's invasion.
Accor, which has 57 branded hotels in Russia and 3,500 employees there, has suspended all future hotel openings and has stopped services and distribution to hotels affected by sanctions.
Burger King is redirecting its profits from franchised operations in Russia to humanitarian efforts
Marriott and IHG Hotels & Resorts, which each have 28 hotels operating in Russia under their brand, have also halted hotel developments and investments and have closed their corporate offices - which they own themselves and so have control over - in Moscow
M&S has pledged more than £1.5m to support refugees and is donating 20,000 coats and thermals
However, while many brands are stuck in Russia, Yum Brands, which owns KFC and Pizza Hut, said it was finalising an agreement with its main franchisee to temporarily halt Pizza Hut operations. 
Ms Hobbs, partner at law firm Bird&Bird said she believed brands were ""very worried"" about any potential reputational damage from continuing to operate in Russia.
""They are worried obviously on a human and moral level about what is happening, but I also think they are worried [that] a number of companies have been threatened with boycotts.""

The Met has apologised and admitted the incident should not have happened
A black schoolgirl was strip-searched by police after being wrongly suspected of carrying cannabis.
The ""traumatic"" search by Metropolitan Police officers took place without another adult present at the girl's secondary school in Hackney in 2020.
A safeguarding report on the incident concluded it was unjustified and racism was ""likely"" to have been a factor.
Scotland Yard said the officers' actions were ""regrettable"" and it ""should never have happened"".
According to the report, the impact on the pupil - referred to as Child Q - was ""profound"" and the repercussions ""obvious and ongoing"".
Family members described her as changing from a ""happy-go-lucky girl to a timid recluse that hardly speaks"", who now self-harms and needs therapy.
Intimate body parts exposed
Police were called to a school in Hackney at the end of 2020 by teachers, who told investigators they had been concerned the teenager had drugs in her possession because she smelt of cannabis.
She was taken to the medical room and strip-searched by two female officers, while teachers remained outside.
During the ordeal her intimate body parts were exposed and she was made to take off her sanitary towel, according to the review. No drugs were found. 
Her family strongly believe the strip search was a racist incident, and the review found her experiences are ""unlikely to have been the same"" had she not been black.
'Adultification bias'
The Local Child Safeguarding Practice Review, published in March, was conducted by City & Hackney Safeguarding Children Partnership (CHSCP) .
It said it was highly likely that ""adultification bias"" was a factor - where adults perceive black children as being older than they are because they see them as more ""streetwise"".
In a written statement to the review, the girl said she wanted everyone who allowed the strip search to happen to ""be held responsible"".
She said: ""I need to know that the people who have done this to me can't do it to anyone else ever again, in fact so no-one else can do this to any other child in their care.""
Investigators found that school staff deferred to the police's authority and ""should have been more challenging"".
This has been accepted by the school, with one staff member saying: ""I have never known, nor would I condone, a strip-search of a young person on a school site.""
'Deeply disturbing case'
The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) was now investigating, the Met confirmed.
Det Supt Dan Rutland, of the Met's Central East Command, said: ""We recognise that the findings of the safeguarding review reflect this incident should never have happened.
""It is truly regrettable and on behalf of the Met Police I would like to apologise to the child concerned, her family and the wider community.""
Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said this was a ""deeply disturbing case"" that no child should face and he would be ""closely following"" the IOPC review.
Hackney Council's mayor and deputy mayor have condemned the ""humiliating, traumatising and utterly shocking treatment"" by police officers.
They have asked for a report in six to nine months on progress made regarding the review's eight findings and 14 recommendations.

New Zealand says it's keen to welcome back international tourists
New Zealand has brought forward plans to reopen its borders to international travellers after a Covid lockout of more than two years.
Australians will be allowed to enter the country without needing to quarantine or isolate from 13 April.
Fully vaccinated travellers from about 60 countries on a visa-waiver list, external will be able to arrive from 2 May. Those nations include the UK and US.
All arrivals will have to show a negative Covid test. 
New Zealand shut its borders in March 2020 as the pandemic spread. They have remained closed, except for a short-lived travel bubble with Australia.
Currently only New Zealand citizens are allowed in and out. 
Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said New Zealand was ""ready to welcome the world back"".
""We have now received guidance that it is safe to significantly bring forward the next stage of border reopening work, bringing back our tourists,"" she said on Wednesday.
People who already have a visa - but are from outside the visa waiver list - will be eligible to enter the country on 1 May.
While tough lockdowns and virtual isolation helped the country get a reputation as a Covid success story, transmission rates have soared recently.

Many Kiwis are struggling to grasp how their country has gone from fewer than 1,000 cases a day to more than 20,000 daily infections in just a couple of weeks. Ms Ardern had pursued an elimination strategy until October last year.
But New Zealand now has a 95% vaccination rate in the eligible population. It has recorded only 115 Covid deaths since the pandemic began.
Despite some easing of isolation requirements for Covid patients, the country remains in its highest level of restrictions with limits on gatherings and mask mandates in many settings.
Mandates have left unvaccinated people in some sectors without jobs, leading to three weeks of protests in the capital Wellington.

464,464,The tragedy of Afghanistan's malnourished children,"Wed, 16 Mar 2022 00:06:50 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-60466398,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-60466398?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,The country's very youngest are casualties of a hunger crisis.,"The tragedy of Afghanistan's malnourished children
Every few seconds a sick child is brought in to the emergency room of the main hospital in Lashkar Gah in a race against time to save the youngest casualties of Afghanistan's hunger crisis.
Amidst the heart-rending sound of dozens of hungry babies crying, and desperate pleas for help from their mothers, nurses scramble to prioritise children who need urgent care. There are many such babies.  
Lashkar Gah is a city in the capital of Helmand, one of Afghanistan's most war-ravaged provinces and lies roughly 400 miles (644km) south-west of Kabul. 
Jalil Ahmed is brought in hardly breathing. His hands and feet have gone cold. He's rushed through to the resuscitation room. His mother Markah says he's two and a half years old, but he looks a lot tinier. He's severely malnourished and has tuberculosis. Doctors work fast to revive him. 
Markah watches in tears. 
""I'm helpless as he suffers. I've spent the whole night scared that at any minute he'll stop breathing,' she says.
Space has to be made in an already full intensive care unit for little Jalil. A doctor carries him there in his arms, as a nurse follows holding up the bottles of fluid and medicines that are being injected into his body through multiple tubes.  
Jalil Ahmed receives urgent treatment
There's no time for the staff to stop. They must quickly put another baby, five-month-old Aqalah, back on oxygen. It's her third time in hospital. Doctors say that a few hours earlier, they thought she wouldn't make it, but right now, she's just about holding on. 
One in every five children admitted to critical care is dying, and the situation at the hospital has been made worse in recent weeks by the spread of the highly contagious measles disease that damages the body's immune system, a deadly blow for babies already suffering from malnutrition.
The hospital, run by charity Medecins Sans Frontieres, is one of a handful of fully-functioning facilities in a province that's home to around 1.5 million people. It's completely overwhelmed. It has 300 beds, but is seeing around 800 patients a day, most of them children. 
There's almost nowhere else for people to turn to. Cutting off the foreign money which ran Afghanistan has dealt a double blow. It's triggered an economic crisis that has brought an already poor population to the brink of starvation, and it's led to the near collapse of the public healthcare system that it almost entirely funded before the Taliban takeover. 
Child malnutrition has long been a problem in Afghanistan, but data collected by Unicef (United Nations Children's Fund) shows a massive surge in the number of children with severe acute malnutrition admitted to hospitals, from 2,407 in August 2021, to 4,214 in December 2021. 
The increase can, in part, be attributed to it being safer to travel to hospitals now that the frontlines have gone, but also misses a large number of malnourished children not taken to hospital because their families cannot afford the journey. Even if they could, they'd need to travel for hours on rubble roads, and it would be hard to find a medical facility that's not dysfunctional.  
The Musa Qala and Gereshk district hospitals are overrun with malnourished children, but neither hospital has operational critical care. There are no female doctors. The hospital buildings are run-down, cold and dark. Electricity comes and goes. Night time temperatures drop to 4C.  
In Gereshk a small heater hooked to a gas cylinder kept in the centre of the rooms provides barely any warmth. Mothers and babies sit huddled under blankets. The smell of disease hangs thick in the air. 
Walid is given oxygen
At Musa Qala, when the breathing of another baby, one-and-a-half-year-old Walid, became irregular, he had to be carried through alleys and doorways to a decaying building next door which had the only oxygen cylinder we saw at the hospital. 
The father of 10-day-old Zakiullah was sent out to find a saline drip solution in the market, because the hospital had no supplies. 
Dr Aziz Ahmed who has worked at Gereshk hospital for more than a decade says they have few medicines and barely any staff, and yet have hundreds of patients coming in every day. They have to turn seriously ill children away because they don't have the facilities to help them, and Dr Ahmed says some have died before they got to a fully functioning hospital.  
He and the other staff didn't receive salaries from August till October. From November, they and some other hospitals in the region have been receiving some payments through humanitarian organisations like Unicef, WHO (World Health Organization) and local charity Baran (Bu Ali Rehabilitation and Aid Network). 
""The humanitarian family is just trying to provide a survival bridge for these children while the world figures out the politics, but we cannot fully fund the health system,"" says Salam Janabi of Unicef. 
""Don't mix up children in politics. The moment here in Afghanistan is critical for children, and every decision the world makes, the politicians make, will impact them.""

Watch: The BBC's Yogita Limaye visits Musa Qala district hospital in Afghanistan's Helmand province
When you travel through Helmand province, destruction caused by war can be seen in almost every area. The scale of it in Sangin town is particularly shocking. 
There are swathes of land covered with debris and mud, where once homes and shops had stood. These areas are where foreign and Afghan troops encountered some of their fiercest battles and where British soldiers were posted.  
Abdul Raziq is from a community that has lived on the frontline for decades. 
""We are happy there is peace now, but we have no food, no work and no money. Wheat and fuel have become too expensive', he says. 
""Hundreds of children in my village are malnourished. In every house, you will find two or three. We have nothing to feed their mothers, that's why they're being born like this.""
Naseebullah with his sister Farzana
In a mud home nearby lives Hameed Gul. Two of his daughters, Farzana and Nazdana, are malnourished. Nazdana is so ill he's sent her to her grandparents because he's unable to feed her. His 10-year-old son Naseebullah has already begun to work on the fields to help out. 
The unending suffering of his family is the legacy of foreign actions, present and past. Hameed's home was bombed in American airstrikes five years ago. Ten of his family, including his parents, six brothers and a sister were killed. 
""We had no connection with the Taliban. My house was unjustly bombed. Neither the Americans, the previous government or the new one offered to help me,"" Hameed says.  
""We eat just dry bread. About two to three nights a week, we go to bed hungry.""
Everywhere we went, we asked what people had eaten that day. Most described sharing a few pieces of dry bread between whole families.  
Children are the most vulnerable in this crisis of hunger. Afghanistan's youngest generation is being left to die. 
In many of the areas we visited, malnutrition deaths might not even get recorded or counted. The world might never know the scale of the tragedy unfolding in Afghanistan.

Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe after she was released from house arrest in Tehran in March 2021
British-Iranian detainee Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe has had her UK passport returned, her MP has said.
She has been detained in Iran for nearly six years after being arrested while visiting her family. She was accused of plotting to overthrow the Iranian government, which she denied.
Tulip Siddiq said Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was still at her family home in Tehran, where she is under house arrest.
Boris Johnson said negotiations were ""going right up to the wire"".
Ms Siddiq, the Labour MP for Hampstead and Kilburn, said she understood British negotiators were in the Iranian capital.
She met Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's husband Richard, external for ""yet another strategy meeting"" on Tuesday - saying she hoped there would not be many more.

'My wife has been used as a bargaining chip'
Mr Johnson said during a visit to Abu Dhabi that talks with Iran over Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's release were ""moving forward"".
He said he would not comment further ""because those negotiations continue to be under way and we're going right up to the wire"".
The prime minister also said negotiations for the release of dual nationals in Tehran had been going on ""for a long time"".
According to Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's employer the Thomson Reuters Foundation, her lawyer Hojjat Kermani has said he is ""hopeful that we will have good news soon"".
A £400m debt relating to a cancelled order for 1,500 Chieftain tanks dating back to the 1970s had been linked to the continued detention of Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe and other UK-Iranian dual nationals held in the country - although the government has said the two issues should not be linked.
Downing Street said it was committed to paying the debt and was ""exploring options to resolve it"", but said it had not been resolved.
A Foreign Office spokesman said it continued to ""explore options"" to resolve the debt but would not comment further as discussions were ongoing.
He added the Foreign Office would not comment on speculation about Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe but had long called for the release of ""unfairly detained British nationals in Iran"".
Former foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt - who has campaigned for her release - said it was traditional for clemency to be shown to some prisoners to coincide with Persian New Year, Nowruz. 
This year's festival falls this Sunday so Mr Hunt said it could be ""a very, very critical next few days"".

Ros Atkins looks at the story behind Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe's detention in Iran - and her husband's campaign to free her
Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe, 43, who has always denied the charges against her, was first jailed for five years in 2016 after being accused of plotting against the regime - spending the last year of her sentence under house arrest at her parents' home.
After that sentence expired she was then sentenced to another year's confinement in April 2021 on charges of ""spreading propaganda"", which has been served at her parents' house in Tehran.
Her husband Richard Ratcliffe, who lives with their daughter Gabriella in Hampstead, London, has campaigned for her release, including by going on hunger strike in October last year.
Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's sister-in-law Rebecca Ratcliffe told BBC Radio 5 live there had been ""so many false hopes"" over the last five or six years so it was hard to tell ""if this is a really positive sign or just the Iranian government playing games again"".
She said her sister-in-law was on edge when things like this happened because she did not want to get her hopes up.
""We have everything crossed, but remain sceptical,"" she said. 
Her mother-in-law, Barbara Ratcliffe, told the BBC Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe ""seemed really quite upbeat when I last spoke to her"", but added that the family was ""all a bit battle-scarred"", having had disappointments in the past.
Sacha Deshmukh, Amnesty International UK's chief executive, warned the latest reports should be treated with caution as there had been ""false dawn after false dawn"" in the long-running process.
And Rupert Skilbeck, director of the Redress human rights organisation, echoed such sentiments.
""We remain cautious and continue to encourage the UK government to do the right thing and ensure the debt it owes to Iran is paid, and that it does everything in its power to secure Nazanin's release,"" he said.
There are other Western passport holders detained by Iran including Anoosheh Ashoori, a retired civil engineer from London, who was convicted of spying for Israel's Mossad intelligence agency in 2019.

The Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby called Russia's attack on Ukraine ""an act of great evil""
The Church of England is putting pressure on TotalEnergies over its decision not to cut business ties with Russia in the wake of its Ukraine invasion.
The church's investment funds said they would reconsider their shareholding in the French energy giant.
The two funds also called for the firm to urgently review its decision.
TotalEnergies has condemned Russia's aggression, but has not followed BP and Shell in withdrawing from Russia. 
The company did not respond to a request for comment.
It was not immediately clear how large a stake the Church of England's Pensions Board and the Church Commissioners investment fund hold in TotalEnergies. They did not respond to requests for comment.
In a joint letter to TotalEnergies chief executive, Patrick Pouyanne, the pension board and the Church Commissioners for England noted the company was at odds with the actions taken by many of its peers.
Last month, the church's pensions board and the Church Commissioners fund dumped £20m worth of investments in Russian businesses. They also banned any further investments in the country.
In a statement to The Times,, external the church said it made the move ""in response to the attack on Ukraine by Russia and supporting the sanctions announced by the UK and other governments"".
The Church Commissioners manage a £9.2bn investment fund while the pensions board oversees a fund worth £3.7bn.
In February, the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby and the Archbishop of York Stephen Cottrell said Russia's ""horrific and unprovoked attack on Ukraine is an act of great evil"".  
The church's letter to TotalEnergies comes after two French NGOs - Greenpeace France and Les Amis de la Terre (Friends of the Earth) France - said they planned to take legal action against the oil giant over possible human rights abuses unless it cuts its business ties with Russia.
Russia represented 24% of TotalEnergies' reserves and 17% of its combined oil and gas production in 2020, company documents show.
Activist investor Clearway Capital has also written to the board of TotalEnergies asking it to exit its operations in Russia after its invasion of Ukraine.

File photo of a previous North Korea ballistic rocket launch
North Korea has fired an ""unknown projectile"" which appeared to fail immediately after launch, South Korea's military said. 
The suspected missile was fired from an airfield outside the capital Pyongyang.
The airfield has been the site of several launches, including previous tests of what were the US alleges were intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs).
It comes as North Korea has in recent weeks stepped up its weapons testing. 
""North Korea fired an unknown projectile from the Sunan area around 09:30 today, but it is presumed that it failed immediately after launch,"" Seoul's Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a statement.
Specialist news site NK News cited witnesses as saying loud ""blowing"" sounds, similar to that of a large aircraft, were audible in Pyongyang, followed by a loud ""crash"". It added that it had seen an image showing a red-tinted ball of smoke in the sky above the capital. 
Speaking to NK News, senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace Ankit Panda said this image was consistent with that of a ""catastrophic failure"". He added that ""reddish-orange smoke"" is associated with liquid fuel - something that is ""very toxic"" to humans. 
North Korea has so far carried out nine weapons tests this year, including what the US claims were tests of parts of a new ICBM, saying they were likely to have been experimental launches before a probable full-range ICBM launch. 
With a minimum range of 5,500km (3,417 miles), ICBMs can reach the US. They are designed for nuclear arms delivery.
North Korea's missile and nuclear programme
The UN prohibits North Korea from ballistic and nuclear weapons tests, and has imposed strict sanctions. 
The North had put a moratorium in place on testing long-range ballistic missiles and nuclear tests after talks with then US President Donald Trump. But in 2020, Mr Kim announced he was no longer bound by this promise.
Pyongyang has however, maintained that the launches on 26 February and 4 March were focused on developing a reconnaissance satellite.
Each launch does help scientists learn what works and what doesn't. But this is a big year for Kim Jong-un. It's his 10th year in charge, he will want success not failure.
Also as one expert pointed out - at what point did this launch fail? 
It was launched at the country's main airport, Sunan. Any major explosion near the ground could damage the airport. 
And any explosion further up could risk debris falling on populated areas. We will know more after further analysis by US and South Korean defence ministries. 
Either way, it is unlikely this failure will deter North Korea. Kim Jong-un has a wish list of weapons - he will press ahead.

468,468,Heathrow Airport drops Covid face mask rules,"Wed, 16 Mar 2022 00:04:17 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-60757887,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-60757887?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,The UK's largest airport joins British Airways and Virgin Atlantic in easing mask-wearing rules.,"Heathrow Airport drops Covid face mask rules
Mask-wearing at Heathrow Airport has moved from being a rule to a recommendation
The UK's largest airport has dropped mandatory face masks for passengers.
Heathrow Airport no longer requires people to wear them in its terminals, railway stations or office buildings but will continue to recommend they do so.
British Airways and Virgin Atlantic are the latest airlines to relax their policies on face coverings.
Passengers must still wear them on board flights if the country they're travelling to requires it.
'Plan B' measures ended in late January, meaning masks were no longer legally required on some public transport and in shops.
However Heathrow, which handles a large number of international flights, had kept the rule that face coverings must be worn, until this week. 
Heathrow's chief operating officer, Emma Gilthorpe, said the airport was pleased to move away from mandatory face mask requirements. 
She said: ""While we still recommend wearing them, we can be confident the investments we've made in Covid-secure measures - some of which aren't always visible - combined with the fantastic protection provided by the vaccine will continue to keep people safe while travelling.""
Heathrow said that if there was a significant rise in infections or a future variant of concern, it would not hesitate to bring the mandate back. 
The airport said face coverings would remain available for people who still want to wear them. 
All UK Covid travel rules to end
Scotland's mask rules will stay in force until April
What are the UK's Living with Covid plans?
Virgin Atlantic said it was also changing its face mask policy from Wednesday, making it a personal choice for customers and crew to wear them on board. 
This will only happen on services where international regulations on mask-wearing do not apply.
For now, that means flights between Heathrow and Manchester and destinations in the Caribbean such as Barbados, St Lucia and Antigua.
The airline said customers may be asked to wear a mask when getting on and off planes and at destination airports.
It highlighted that on routes to or from the US, masks would still be required until at least 18 April.
Virgin Atlantic's chief customer and operating officer, Corneel Koster, said its policy would be introduced gradually. He encouraged passengers to respect each other's choices.
From Wednesday, British Airways (BA) customers will only have to wear a face covering on board flights if the destination they're travelling to requires it. 
BA's chief operating officer, Jason Mahoney, said the move was ""welcome"" and ""a positive step forward"".
Earlier this month, the airline and tour operator Jet2 relaxed its rules on face coverings for flights to and from England and Northern Ireland. Since Friday, Tui has done the same. 
Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary has said he would like to see the end of mandatory face masks by April or May. He added that cabin crew were being consulted.
The aviation industry is hoping that the easing of travel restrictions will lift the curtain on a busy summer, after two years of major disruption due to the pandemic.
From Friday, all travellers will be able to enter the UK without filling in a passenger locator form or taking Covid tests.  
Holidaymakers will still need to be aware of, and follow, and rules where they're going.
On Friday Heathrow's chief executive John Holland-Kaye said the recovery of aviation ""remains overshadowed by war and Covid uncertainty"".   
The airport's passenger numbers last month were still nearly 50% down on pre-pandemic levels. 
However the airport is recruiting 12,000 staff to try and cope with demand during the summer peak.

Robert Mokaya is the UK's only black chemistry professor. His applications for research grants to the country's main funding body have all been turned down.
Of the 575 chemistry professors in the UK, just one is black. 
In the 15 years Robert Mokaya has been a professor at Nottingham university, he has had all his applications for funding for research projects turned down by Britain's main chemistry funding body, now called the UK Research and Innovation agency.
""That is not typical for a professor,"" he tells me phlegmatically. 
""I have had research papers published which I would have expected would have enabled me to obtain funding to do follow-up research.
""I wonder if this is typical for someone of my sort of surname. 
""It has been very, very difficult,"" he says.
Funding applications are reviewed and decided by fellow experts in the field whose names are not published, but the name of the applicant is known to the reviewers.
Despite the constant rejections of funding applications, Robert has done extremely well for himself. He is a noted materials chemist, specialising in the study of materials for sustainable energy storage and has had numerous publications in scientific journals. 
He was able to do his research because of funding from charities and learned societies, such as the Royal Society, which funds only the researchers it judges to have a track record of excellence in their work. 
Robert is currently a pro-vice-chancellor at Nottingham university and a trustee of the Royal Society of Chemistry (RSC), external.
The RSC has published an investigation, external which shows that racism is ''pervasive'' in the field. The report finds that it is ""hard to challenge"" and marginalisation of minorities has become ""normalised"" in universities and industry.
The investigation also bears out Robert's experience, finding that minority ethnic researchers are less likely to get grant funding, promotions and are paid significantly less. In  2019/20 the average grant for a minority ethnic chemical sciences researcher was £320,000, compared with £355,000 for white colleagues.
The RSC's chief executive, Dr Helen Pain, described the stories of discrimination she had seen as part of the investigation as ""shocking"".
""Racism is unfortunately a reality of chemical sciences, just as it is in wider society"" she told BBC News. 
""We need to do better. We need to make a difference.
Sandile Mtetwa says her fellow black PhD students have opted out of university research because they don't believe they will be supported
In response to the report, Prof Melanie Welham, UKRI's executive champion for people, culture and talent, told BBC News that the agency was reviewing its processes to address concerns about unequal treatment.
""We know we must do more, and we're committed to doing so.""
""This includes piloting and learning to embed effective practice on equality, diversity and inclusion in our expert review and assessment practices, such as through double-blind reviewing, and allowing applicants to evidence their contributions in a wider range of ways. 
The RSC report also shows that ethnic minority students are interested in studying chemistry at university, but they are put off by what they perceive to be an unwelcoming atmosphere of academic research. This is especially true of black students and researchers.
Official figures show that at undergraduate level 4.9% of students studying chemistry-related subjects identify as black, significantly higher than the national 3.0% of the UK population. But most choose not to enter research. Those who do fall away at every stage of the career ladder: 1.4% of postgraduate chemistry researchers identify as black, 1% of lecturers and 0% of professors.
""I don't exist!"" laughs Robert.
There are no black professors in the official statistics because the number 1 is rounded down to zero for accounting purposes. Robert's good humour subsides, though, as he tells me about his journey to becoming the UK's only black chemistry professor. He says: ''It has been a struggle.""
""In academia you have to get signals from more senior colleagues that it is time to apply for a more senior role that comes up. Early in my career the signals I got is that this is not the place for you and it is not the right time for you.
''This was the most difficult part of my career and this is where the main blockage is for black chemists. Once I broke through and was networked it got better''.
Sandile Mtetwa is a black PhD student at Cambridge University. She co-founded a group for African students studying science subjects. She says many of them have decided not to struggle through. Instead they have decided to get jobs in the private sector because they felt there was ""prejudice"", and they would not be supported if they went into academic research.
""The chemical sciences community is so network driven. You have to know someone to get on,'' she tells me.
''Someone senior has to support you, to help you get a position, to get a grant. If someone up there is not cheering for you, you can't do much about it"".
The RSC report says that there is little incentive for chemistry organisations to improve. Most initiatives are voluntary and appear to be having a limited impact, it says. 
It finds that just 21 universities out of the 93 that signed up for the award hold a bronze Race Equality Charter award, run by the higher education charity Advance HE. None have received a silver or gold award, despite the scheme being launched in 2016. Similarly, 37% of FTSE 100 companies have no representation of minority ethnicities on their board, despite a target set by an independent review, also in 2016, to have one director from a minority ethnic background on every board by 2021.
The RSC has launched a race and ethnicity unit to push for change in organisations. It has also set up a five-year mentoring scheme to help school leavers follow to chemistry-focused degrees and is working with employers to provide ethnic minority students with job opportunities and to help them with their career progression. 
Robert Mokaya says he hopes that these initiatives will bring about changes for the next generation of ethnic minority chemical scientists. 
""I am concerned for those coming through the system. 
""I don't think it is fair that those who get to a senior position in chemical sciences should have to go through what I have had to go through.""

470,470,Government overseen years of decline in NHS - MPs,"Wed, 16 Mar 2022 00:17:31 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-60754227,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-60754227?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,"Failures in England pre-date the pandemic, as waiting times rise, a cross-party group says.","Government overseen years of decline in NHS - MPs
The government has overseen years of decline in cancer care and non-urgent hospital services in England, MPs say.
The House of Commons Public Accounts Committee said services had started deteriorating long before the pandemic.
It pointed out key targets had not been met since 2016 and the pandemic had just exacerbated the problems.
But ministers said they were investing extra money and creating more capacity to treat patients, to address the backlog that had now developed.

About the data
About the data
Ambulance queues
When patients arrive at hospital by ambulance they should be handed over within 15 minutes. This data shows the proportion of ambulance patients who waited 30 minutes or more, in the week shown. It comes from daily situation reports which are published weekly during the winter in England. As this is fast-turnaround data, the NHS says only minimal validation can be carried out but it is considered fit for purpose. 
Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland do not publish ambulance queue data. 
A&E waits
Patients at A&E should be seen within four hours of arrival. This data shows the proportion of patients attending A&E who waited longer than four hours to be treated, discharged or admitted.
This data is published monthly for England and Wales and weekly for Scotland. Northern Ireland publishes its data quarterly and Winter 2021 is not yet available. 
Bed waits and occupancy
If a patient at A&E needs to be admitted, the wait from decision to admit to being given a bed on a ward is recorded in England. The bed waits figure is the proportion of patients admitted via A&E who waited longer than four hours for a ward bed.
In Wales, bed wait data is not published, so the figure shown is the occupancy level in general and acute beds. Scotland and Northern Ireland do not publish bed wait or bed occupancy data.
NHS trusts and boards
Data for England is show by NHS trust, where the trust includes at least one hospital with a Type 1 A&E department. Type 1 means a consultant-led 24 hour A&E service with full resuscitation facilities. 
When you enter a postcode for a location in England you will be shown a list of NHS trusts in your area. They will not necessarily be in order of your closest hospital as some trusts have more than one hospital. Data for Wales and Scotland are shown by NHS board. 
Comparative data from two years ago is shown where available. However, where trusts have merged there is no like-for-like comparison to show. Bed occupancy data in Wales only goes back to April 2020.

More than six million people are currently on a hospital waiting list - one in nine of the population - the highest figure on record.
This includes people waiting for operations such as knee and hip replacements.
Meanwhile, just two-thirds of urgent cancer patients start treatment within the target time of 62 days.
And the number of referrals for cancer care has dropped by between 240,000 and 740,000 since the pandemic started.
The MPs said people would face serious health consequences because of delays in cancer treatment, with some dying earlier.
The government is also accused of failing to recognise staffing the health service remains its biggest problem. 
The MPs said the workforce was crippled by shortages and exhausted by two years of the pandemic.
'Extremely concerned'
Dame Meg Hillier, who chairs the PAC, said: ""The Department for Health and Social Care has overseen a long-term decline that is dragging our NHS and the heroic staff down.""
And she was ""extremely concerned"" there was still no real plan to tackle the problems.
Last month, the government announced a recovery plan, with an extra £8bn being invested over the next three years, which ministers said would see 30% more patients treated.
Crucial to this will be the establishment of a network of 160 community diagnostic centres along with surgical hubs focused on high-volume routine surgery away from major hospital sites - to increase efficiency and reduce the chance of emergency cases leading to cancellations.
The Department for Health and Social Care defended its record, saying it had been investing extra money into services throughout the period and the new plan would have a real impact on waits.

Pregnant women should be asked how much alcohol they are drinking and the answer recorded in their medical notes, new ""priority advice"" for the NHS says. 
The advice, from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), is designed to help spot problem drinking that can harm babies. 
Infants with foetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) can be left with lifelong problems.
The safest approach during pregnancy is to abstain from alcohol completely.
Babies cannot process alcohol well - passed from mother to child through the placenta, it can stay in their body for a long time and stop them developing normally in the womb.
Alcohol while pregnant is like Russian roulette
FASD: What it does to children
There is no particular treatment for FASD - and the damage to the brain and organs such as the heart and kidneys is irreversible.
The more someone drinks while pregnant, the higher the chance of FASD - and there is no proven ""safe"" level of alcohol.
But the risk of harming the baby is ""likely to be low if you have drunk only small amounts of alcohol before you knew you were pregnant or during pregnancy"", the Department of Health says.
And official statistics suggest one in 10 pregnant women says they have had some alcohol in the past week, external. 
Child's record
An earlier draft of the recommendations for NHS staff in England and Wales suggested transferring data on a woman's alcohol intake to her child's medical notes - but this has now been dropped, following concern women who needed help might hide their drinking.
The Royal College of Midwives spokeswoman Lia Brigante said: ""As there is no known safe level of alcohol consumption during pregnancy, the RCM believes it is appropriate and important to advise women that the safest approach is to avoid drinking alcohol during pregnancy and advocates for this. 
""We are pleased to see that the recommendation to record alcohol consumption and to then transfer this to a child's record has been reconsidered. 
""This had the potential to disrupt or prevent the development of a trusting relationship between a woman and her midwife."" 
Birth defects
Claire Murphy, from the British Pregnancy Advisory Service, stressed the vast majority of pregnant women drank below levels associated with harm.
""We remain concerned about the routine questioning of women throughout pregnancy on this issue,"" she said. 
""Our research shows women find antenatal discussions about alcohol - even when they don't drink at all - can supersede other issues important to them, like their own mental health and wellbeing. 
""Those supporting pregnant women must be able to provide care that meets the needs of the individual before them, not just to fill in boxes on a checklist.""
Dr Paul Chrisp, director of NICE's centre for guidelines, said: ""This quality standard aims to improve the diagnosis and care offered to children and young people with FASD as well as ensuring that women are given consistent advice about their alcohol consumption during pregnancy.
""FASD is a series of preventable mental and physical birth defects associated with alcohol use during pregnancy. 
""Helping women to drink less or no alcohol during their pregnancy will reduce the number of children and young people affected by FASD.""

472,472,Ukraine: Putin will search for a way to save face,"Wed, 16 Mar 2022 00:30:49 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-60756993,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-60756993?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,"What might Putin want, to be able to come out of the war looking good in the eyes of Russia's majority?","Ukraine: Putin will search for a way to save face
Russian tank destroyed by Ukrainian forces in Luhansk
Even the worst war comes to an end. Sometimes, as in 1945, the only outcome is a fight to the death. Mostly, though, wars end in a deal which doesn't satisfy anyone entirely, but at least brings the bloodshed to an end. 
And often, even after the worst and most bitter conflicts, the two sides gradually resume their old, less hostile relationship.
If we're lucky, we're beginning to see the start of this process happening now between Russia and Ukraine. 
The resentment, particularly on the Ukrainian side, will last for decades. But both sides want and need peace: Ukraine, because its towns and cities have taken a terrible battering, and Russia, because it has already, according to the Ukrainian president, sacrificed more men and material than it lost in its two shockingly violent wars in Chechnya - although that is impossible to verify.
But no-one willingly signs a peace agreement which is likely to lead to their own downfall. 
For Russian President Vladimir Putin the search is on for ways of saving face. Ukraine's President Zelensky has already shown remarkable skill as a diplomat, and he's clearly willing to say and do whatever is acceptable to himself and his people in order to get Russia off his country's back. 
For him, there's one overriding objective - to make sure that Ukraine comes out of this appalling experience a united, independent country, not a province of Russia, which is what President Putin originally seemed to think he could turn it into.
For President Putin, all that counts now is that he can declare victory. No matter that everyone in his entire administration will understand that Russia has been given a bloody nose in this unnecessary invasion. No matter that the 20% or so of Russians who understand what's really going on in the world will know that Putin has bet the house on a fantasy of his own devising, and lost. 
The battle will be for the support of the remaining majority of the population, who tend to believe implicitly what they're told on state television - even when there are moments such as the sudden popping-up on screen of the extraordinarily brave TV editor Marina Ovsyannikova with a placard to say that everything people are being told is propaganda.
So what will make President Putin come out of this disastrous war looking good in the eyes of Russia's majority?
Firstly, an assurance, perhaps even to be written into Ukraine's constitution, that it has no intention of joining Nato in the foreseeable future. President Zelensky has already prepared the way for this, by asking Nato for something it couldn't agree to (establishing  a no-fly-zone over Ukraine), then criticising the alliance for letting him down on this, and finally musing out loud that he wasn't sure that if Nato behaved like this, it was actually worth joining. 
As clever and wise political positioning goes, it doesn't get much better than this. Nato gets the blame, which it can easily cope with, and Ukraine gets the freedom to act as it wants.
But that's the easy bit. It'll be harder to finesse the urgent ambition which Zelensky and Ukraine have to join the EU, something Russia is almost equally hostile to, though there are ways around that too. Hardest of all for Ukraine to swallow will be Russia's outright theft of Ukrainian territory, in total defiance of the solemn international treaty it had signed to protect Ukraine's borders. 
The loss of Crimea in 2014 is something Ukraine may well be forced to give its formal acceptance to, in some way. And Russia clearly intends to hang on to those areas in eastern Ukraine which are pretty much effectively under Russian control already - and perhaps more.
In 1939, Joseph Stalin invaded Finland, which had once been part of the Russian empire. He was sure his troops would carve their way through it in no time - just as Putin thought about Ukraine in 2022. Stalin's generals, understandably terrified for their lives, promised him he was right. And, of course, he wasn't. 
The Winter War dragged on into 1940, the Soviet army was humiliated, and Finland was left with a justifiable national pride in itself for resisting a superpower. It lost territory, because autocrats like Stalin and Putin need to come out of these things looking as though they've scored a victory. But Finland kept the most important, most imperishable thing: its full independence as a free, self-determining nation.
As things stand today, Ukraine - having beaten off so many Russian attacks and made Putin's forces look feeble and ineffective - should be able to do that. Unless Putin's armies can capture Kyiv and much more of Ukraine's territory, then Ukraine will survive as a national entity, just as Finland did in 1940. 
Losing Crimea and parts of eastern Ukraine would be a bitter, illegal and wholly unjust loss. But Vladimir Putin would have to start using far more serious weapons even than he has already, if he's to come out on top. As things stand, in the third week of fighting, no-one can seriously doubt who the real winner in this war will be.

Oleksandr Kamyshin, 37, says Ukraine's railway staff have helped an estimated 2.5 million people to reach safety
There is a last-minute change of plan. He won't be leaving from the main station after all. The bodyguards move fast and we follow, racing along the quiet streets behind the convoy, and into the suburbs. 
The Russians would like to kill him. 
Oleksandr Kamyshin is sure of this. So the 37-year-old chairman of Ukraine's railway network constantly changes his travel plans. Never stay in one place too long. Never have a routine that the Russians can discover.
""We have to be faster than those people who try to track us,"" he tells me. 
The railway is the country's biggest employer with 231,000 staff across 233,000 square miles (603,470 sq km) of territory - Ukraine is the second-largest country in Europe.
So far Mr Kamyshin estimates his staff have helped to move 2.5 million people to safety. But the vast operation has come at a cost. Schedules have to be constantly updated because of Russian attacks. Since Vladimir Putin's invasion began, 33 railway staff have been killed.
""They hit our track daily. They hit the stations. Our people risk their lives. They go under shelling. They keep saving people,"" says Mr Kamyshin. 
When we first meet, he is sitting at a long table with his close advisors, studying a map of the national rail network. Police guard the entrance to the room.
Mr Kamyshin keeps his guards and advisors close
There are constant phone calls. ""Thank you for your support. But I also have a request,"" he says to one caller. ""Please help us build trade between Ukraine and Poland."" He hangs up and smiles. ""That was the Polish minister for infrastructure,"" he says. 
Mr Kamyshin wants to set up a joint venture with Poland to send Ukrainian exports west. 
Before joining the railways Mr Kamyshin was a financier but he is now one of the most important men in the country. In a few weeks he has gone from reforming the rail sector to a wartime director of operations. 
""All people in Ukraine were businesspeople, farmers and all other professions before the war started. Now all people in Ukraine are at war. All of us have started doing war,"" he says.
His own life is a blur of rail journeys, stopping at one place to talk to local staff, at another to meet government officials, and constantly in contact with the senior leadership in Kyiv. 
Mr Kamyshin is convinced he is a target for Russian forces
He hasn't seen his wife and two young sons since the war started nearly three weeks ago.
Not only do the railways keep refugees moving, they also deliver tonnes of aid to the embattled areas of the country, transport troops to frontline cities, and continue to export whatever Ukraine can produce in these wartime conditions. A Russian blockade has closed the key ports in the south.
Mr Kamyshin comes across as a man who is planning for a long campaign. ""Instead of seaports we go west,"" he explains. ""We have launched a programme to relocate production from east to west. So we can move people, ideas, plans, maybe machinery to launch new production in the west.""
It is an ambitious project and could be essential to the country's economic survival. However, Mr Kamyshin believes the West needs to do more than supply weapons and humanitarian aid.
Since Russia's invasion began, thousands of people have been packing train platforms daily to travel to safer locations
He wants the Nato military alliance to enforce a no-fly zone. It is a mantra repeated by government officials at nearly every opportunity - however unlikely the prospect of it happening. 
""This war will be won by Ukraine anyway. Now the only thing that needs to happen is the closing of the sky by the West.""
My last sight of Mr Kamyshin is close to midnight at a suburban rail depot. He is walking along the side of the tracks in darkness until the spotlight of the approaching train briefly illuminates his small group. 
The train pulls alongside and a stewardess welcomes him on board. I cannot say where his train is heading, but the night ahead will be filled with calls and discussions. There will be a few hours of sleep, perhaps, and constant checking of where the Russians have recently attacked.
""We will keep repairing the tracks once the firing stops,"" he says before leaving. ""We will keep the trains running as long as we can. There is no other option for us.""

The Slovenian, Polish and Czech prime ministers, together with Poland's ruling party leader, took the long journey from Warsaw
On day 20 of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, residents in the capital Kyiv were placed under a 35-hour curfew - but that didn't stop the prime ministers of Poland, Slovenia and the Czech Republic from travelling there by train.
The trip was a Polish idea, after the EU warned of potential security risks. 
The leaders decided to go by train because flying by Polish military jet could have been viewed by Russia as dangerously provocative, BBC Europe editor Katya Adler reported. It was not immediately clear when their train would make the return trip to Warsaw.
Poland's Mateusz Morawiecki said history was being made in Ukraine's capital.
""It is here, that freedom fights against the world of tyranny. It is here that the future of us all hangs in the balance,"" he tweeted. Mr Morawiecki added that Ukraine could count on the help of its friends. 
The prime ministers sat down for a briefing with their Ukrainian counterpart Denis Shmyhal, and President Volodymyr Zelensky, who thanked them for the ""powerful"" gesture of support. 
They were accompanied to Ukraine by Jaroslaw Kaczynski, the leader of Poland's ruling Law and Justice party. 
Sepsis and hunger as civilians hide
Russian artillery and warplanes are continuing to pound cities and towns across Ukraine.
In Mariupol, a key port city in the south-east, hundreds of people crammed into the basement of a large public building are running out of food, with many also in need of urgent medical help, the BBC's Hugo Bachega was told.
""Some have developed sepsis from shrapnel in the body,"" said Anastasiya Ponomareva, a 39-year-old teacher who fled the city at the start of the war but is in contact with friends there. ""Things are very serious.""
Her friends are with other families who spend most of their day in the basement. From time to time they go upstairs for sunlight, but rarely outside. They have all left homes that are no longer safe or no longer standing.
A satellite image shows fires burning following Russian strikes in residential area of eastern Mariupol, Ukraine
At an intensive care hospital on the western outskirts of the city, staff described being treated like hostages by Russian forces.
One employee was quoted as saying that Russian troops had ""forced 400 people from neighbouring houses to come to our hospital,"" adding: ""We can't leave.""
The regional governor, Pavlo Kyrylenko, said the facility had been all but destroyed by shelling in recent days, but that staff had continued to treat patients in the basement.
Separately, about 2,000 cars were able to leave Mariupol along a humanitarian evacuation route, according to city authorities. Before the war around 400,000 people lived in the city, which has endured intense bombardment by Russian forces. The city council says well over 2,000 civilians have died.
Cameraman and journalist killed in Kyiv
A cameraman and a journalist working for Fox News were killed when their vehicle was struck by incoming fire on the outskirts of the Ukrainian capital Kyiv, staff at the US network said.
Cameraman Pierre Zakrzewski (left) and journalist Oleksandra Kuvshinova (seen here wearing a helmet and protective vest)
Fox News chief executive Suzanne Scott described the deaths of Pierre Zakrzewski, 55, and Oleksandra Kuvshinova, 24, as ""heart-breaking"".
Their colleague, 39-year-old Benjamin Hall, was also wounded in the incident and taken to hospital.
The attack followed the death on Sunday of 50-year-old US journalist Brent Renaud, who was shot and killed in the Ukrainian town of Irpin.
Missing anti-war TV journalist reappears
The Russian journalist who protested against the war in Ukraine on a live TV news programme and shared a video describing the invasion as a crime was fined 30,000 roubles (£214; $280) and released.
Marina Ovsyannikova, an editor at state-controlled Channel One, was detained on Monday after she ran onto the set holding a sign saying ""no war"". But concerns were later raised over her safety after reports that she could not be contacted.
On Tuesday, however, she appeared at a court hearing.
Marina Ovsyannikova appeared in court on Tuesday with lawyer Anton Gashinsky
Ms Ovsyannikova told reporters afterwards that she had gone two days with no sleep, had been questioned for over 14 hours, and was not given access to legal help.
Russians agree to bring US astronaut back to Earth
Fears that US astronaut Mark Vande Hei - who has been in space for 355 days - might lose his lift back to Earth on board a Russian capsule were thankfully put to bed when it was confirmed he would indeed be making the trip home.
Astronaut Mark Vande Hei has spent 355 days in space - a new US record
The American, and two other Russian cosmonauts, will be brought back, landing in Kazakhstan.
Joel Montalbano, Nasa's ISS programme manager, said: ""I can tell you for sure Mark is coming home... We are in communication with our Russian colleagues. There's no fuzz on that.""
Biden barred from entering Russia
Meanwhile, as Western nations impose further sanctions on Russia, Moscow retaliated on Tuesday by slapping sanctions on US President Joe Biden and 12 other US officials.
The list includes Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin, press secretary Jen Psaki and other members of the administration.
But there were also a couple of surprises on the list: former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Mr Biden's son, Hunter.
The measures block their entry into Russia and freeze any assets held in the country.

475,475,Ukraine war: Could Russia use tactical nuclear weapons?,"Wed, 16 Mar 2022 00:32:03 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-60664169,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-60664169?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,"Russia's nuclear weapons are 'combat ready', raising fears they could be used on the battlefield.","Ukraine war: Could Russia use tactical nuclear weapons?
Russia's President Vladimir Putin has said he's ready to use nuclear weapons to defend Russian territory, raising the fear he might use a small, or ""tactical"" nuclear weapon in Ukraine. 
US President Joe Biden has warned him that doing so would be the most serious military escalation since World War II.
What are tactical nuclear weapons?
Tactical nuclear weapons are small nuclear warheads and delivery systems intended for use on the battlefield, or for a limited strike. 
They are designed to destroy enemy targets in a specific area without causing widespread radioactive fallout.
The smallest tactical nuclear weapons can be one kiloton or less (producing the equivalent to a thousand tonnes of the explosive TNT). The largest ones can be as big as 100 kilotons. 
Strategic nuclear weapons are larger (up to 1,000 kilotons) and are launched from longer range.
By comparison, the atomic bomb the US dropped on Hiroshima in 1945 was 15 kilotons.
What tactical nuclear weapons does Russia have?
According to US intelligence, Russia has about about 2,000 tactical nuclear weapons, external. 
Its tactical nuclear warheads can be placed on various types of missiles which are normally used to deliver conventional explosives, such as cruise missiles and artillery shells. 
Tactical nuclear weapons can also be fired from aircraft and ships - as anti-ship missiles, torpedoes and depth charges.
The US says Russia has recently been investing heavily in these weapons to improve their range and accuracy.
How many nuclear weapons does Russia have?
What are the nuclear risks?
Have tactical nuclear weapons ever been used before?
Tactical nuclear weapons have never been used in conflict.
Nuclear powers such as the US and Russia have found it equally effective to destroy targets on the battlefield by using modern conventional munitions.
In addition, no nuclear-armed country has so far been willing to risk unleashing all-out nuclear war by employing tactical nuclear weapons.
However, Russia might be more willing to use smaller tactical weapons than larger strategic missiles. 
""They might not see it as crossing this big nuclear threshold,"" says Dr Patricia Lewis, head of the international security programme at the Chatham House think tank.
""They could see it as part of their conventional forces."" 
Russian forces can fire small nuclear warheads using conventional artillery, such as the ""Malka"" self-propelled gun
Are Putin's nuclear threats a real cause to worry?
In February 2022, shortly before invading Ukraine, President Putin placed Russia's nuclear forces at ""special combat readiness"" and held high-profile nuclear drills.
More recently, he said: ""If the territorial integrity of our country is threatened, we will without a doubt use all available means to protect Russia and our people. This is not a bluff."" 
Russia is planning to annex the regions of southern and eastern Ukraine it has occupied after holding self-styled referendums. President Putin says he is ready to defend the ""territorial integrity"" of the regions ""by all means.""
US intelligence see this as a threat to the West not to help Ukraine try and retake these territories, rather than as a sign that he is planning a nuclear war. 
But others worry that Russia, if it suffers further setbacks, might be tempted to use a smaller tactical weapon in Ukraine as a ""game changer"", to break a stalemate or avoid defeat.  
James Acton, a nuclear expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Pace in Washington DC, says: ""I am legitimately worried that in that circumstance, Putin might use a nuclear weapon - most likely on the ground in Ukraine to terrify everyone and get his way. We are not at that point yet.""
How has the US responded?
US President Joe Biden has warned Russia not to use nuclear weapons in the war in Ukraine.
Speaking during an interview with CBS News, Mr Biden said such action would ""change the face of war unlike anything since World War Two,"" adding: ""It'll be consequential.""  
How the US and Nato would respond to any nuclear use is hard to predict. They may not want to escalate the situation further and risk all-out nuclear war but they also might want to draw a line.
However, Russia might also be deterred from using tactical nuclear weapons by another power - China.
""Russia is heavily dependent on Chinese support,"" says Dr Heather Williams, nuclear expert at Kings College London. 
""But China has a 'no first use' nuclear doctrine. So if Putin did use them, it would be incredibly difficult for China to stand by him. 
""If he used them, he would probably lose China.""

476,476,Nigerian volunteer: 'Fighting in Ukraine is better than living here',"Wed, 16 Mar 2022 00:33:05 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-60712913,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-60712913?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,Hundreds of young men across the continent say they want to take up arms in Ukraine.,"Nigerian volunteer: 'Fighting in Ukraine is better than living here'
When Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine last month, 27-year-old Nigerian Ottah Abraham was outraged.
He picked up his phone and tweeted: ""I want to join the team.""
He was some 8,700km (5,400 miles) away from the front line, in a small apartment in Nigeria's main city, Lagos.
The philosophy graduate is one of several hundred Africans, from countries like Nigeria, Kenya, Senegal, South Africa and Algeria, who say they are willing to take up arms in the battle against Russia, partly to escape the bleak prospects faced by many young men at home. 
""We know that it's war, it's not child's play,"" he told the BBC. ""But being a soldier in Ukraine would be better than being here.
""I'll probably be allowed to stay if the war ends, plus I'll be a hero and fight an undeniable enemy.""
Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said that some 20,000 volunteers from across the world had already applied to enlist. They came after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky made a global appeal for foreign fighters to ""come and stand shoulder to shoulder with Ukrainians"".
The government has temporarily axed its visa requirements and offered equipment and a salary to those with a valid passport and military training. There has been no official confirmation that foreign fighters will be allowed to stay in the country after the war. 
Kereti Usoroh, a Nigerian living in the capital, Abuja, said his motivations for volunteering had nothing to do with financial gain or the prospect of citizenship.
""I already live a comfortable life. If I wanted to go to Europe, I'd do it through education, not war,"" the 29-year-old lawyer said.
""This is about beating a bully - injustice for one is injustice for all.""
Sentiments to gladden the hearts of Ukrainian diplomats and days after President Zelenksy's appeal, dozens of hopeful volunteers headed to the Ukrainian embassy in Abuja, with ambitions of enlisting.
Mercenaries not welcome
But the Ukrainian embassy in Nigeria - like others in Africa - has had to back-pedal as many of the continent's governments do not want their nationals to fight in Ukraine.
""Nigeria discourages the use of mercenaries anywhere in the world and will not tolerate the recruitment,"" Nigeria's foreign ministry wrote in a statement.
Bohdan Soltys, a Ukrainian embassy official in Nigeria, said they were not paying Africans to fight - and people would have to pay for their own flights to reach Europe.
""There's a fine line between foreign volunteers and mercenaries,"" he told the BBC. 
A British paramedic was pictured crossing into Ukraine on 5 March to join the international legion
He later clarified that he had been instructed to turn away any volunteers who arrived at the embassy. 
Senegal also warned its citizens against enlisting in the war and ordered the Ukrainian ambassador to take down a Facebook post that had called for Senegalese volunteers, calling the recruitment effort ""illegal and punishable by law.""
The Algerian foreign ministry issued a similar order to its Ukrainian embassy.
""My country says I'm not allowed to go. I tried writing to the foreign ministry. They didn't answer me, but I will try again,"" 28-year-old Algerian Belhadj Hani Amir told the BBC.
""I want to go to Ukraine, but I also hope this war ends as soon as possible.""  
Ukraine's ambassador to South Africa, Mozambique and Botswana Liubov Abravitova told the BBC that hundreds of people from across southern African had volunteered to fight or work in a humanitarian capacity - but she was unable to act on their requests as she was waiting for instructions from their governments. South Africa has a strict law against mercenaries.
In fact, Ukraine's official website for recruiting the ""international legion"" of volunteers, which provides the contact details of local embassies around the world, no longer includes missions in African countries. 
A representative working for the website confirmed that some African countries were removed because of ""regulatory restrictions"". 
'Russian brothers'
Algeria, Senegal and South Africa were among 17 of Africa's 54 countries which abstained from the vote at the UN to condemn the invasion of Ukraine, as they wanted to avoid antagonising Russia. 
A pro-Russian rally was held in Bangui, capital of CAR, earlier this month
And Russia is not without support in Africa. It has expanded its influence on the continent - especially militarily, by helping countries like the Central African Republic (CAR), Libya, Mali and Sudan fight rebels or Islamist militants. 
A video purporting to show soldiers from CAR vowing to join their ""Russian brothers"" has also been circulating online, though the BBC could not independently verify the source and a government official has not responded to a request for comment.
Last Friday, Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu said that ""over 16,000 fighters"" from the Middle East had volunteered to fight with the Russian army - it is not clear if this includes any from North Africa.
But with African governments clamping down on the recruitment of their own citizens, it is unclear if any of the men will make it to the front line - and a Ukrainian official in charge of registering foreign volunteers told the BBC that no Africans had arrived.
Disappointment
For some, like David Osagie Adeleke from Nigeria's south-western Oyo state, this was a devastating blow.
Prince Nkem Nduche (L), who wanted to fight in Ukraine, trained in Russia at a military academy several years ago
The 21-year-old, who has worked as an emergency rescue worker for the Red Cross, had been preparing to enlist as a combatant, having collected the necessary documentation, including a letter of recommendation. 
""I went straight to the police station to collect my documents,"" he said, explaining that a clean criminal record was one of the requirements for enlisting.
""I'm disappointed to hear that the embassy is now saying it won't take us Africans.""
With his emails to the Ukrainian embassy now bouncing back, he is looking into alternative routes to get to the country's border.
""I've got an interview with the Polish embassy in Nigeria,"" he said.
Prince Nkem Nduche, who was among those at the Ukrainian embassy in Abuja, has more knowledge than most about the situation in Ukraine and is more sanguine.
He actually spent some time in Russia as a youngster, has dual citizenship and even enrolled at Russia's military academy - but was jailed for a short time, accused of being a spy after he was spotted at the American embassy.
He said he fled the country seven years ago, via Ukraine - and would happily fight against Russia, but accepts it is not to be.
""I wanted to go on my own but as the Nigerian government said we can't go… I will obey them,"" he told the BBC.

An explosion at an apartment building on Friday
Hundreds of people are crammed into the basement of a large public building in the besieged Ukrainian port city of Mariupol, but are running out of food, with many also in need of urgent medical help.  
""Some have developed sepsis from shrapnel in the body,"" said Anastasiya Ponomareva, a 39-year-old teacher who fled the city at the start of the war but was still in contact with friends there. ""Things are very serious.""
The city is encircled by Russian troops and remains under constant bombardment with almost 400,000 people still trapped without running water, and food and medical supplies quickly running out. The local authorities say the war there has left at least 2,400 civilians dead, but even they acknowledge that this is an underestimate.
Ms Ponomareva's friends are with other families in the basement of the building. They have all left homes that are no longer safe or no longer standing.
""People who managed to hide in underground shelters basically live there permanently,"" Ms Ponomareva said from the western city of Drohobych, where she was living. ""They practically cannot leave at all.""

WATCH: Drone footage shows extensive Mariupol shelling damage
Most of their day is spent hiding in the basement. From time to time they go upstairs for some sunlight, but rarely outside. Conditions, she was told, were quickly deteriorating, as some people had a fever and nothing could be done to treat them. ""There is no medical help, no antibiotics."" 
Some streets are so dangerous that few go out to pick up the dead. Many are being buried in mass graves. The almost non-stop Russian attacks have turned their old neighbourhoods into wasteland. New drone footage (pictured above) showed the vast extent of the damage, with fire and smoke billowing out of apartment blocks and blackened streets in ruins. 
""On the left bank, there's no residential building intact, it's all burned to the ground,"" Ms Ponomareva said. ""The city centre is unrecognisable.""
Sheltering in the same building, a family of four has been in touch with Serhii Kozyrkov, a 40-year-old pastor who left Mariupol two weeks ago. ""It's very crowded and there isn't enough food,"" Mr Kozyrkov, who is now in Lviv, said. ""People get ill because it's very cold and everyone is lying next to each other.""
The family are desperate to flee. On Tuesday, about 2,000 cars managed to exit Mariupol, the city council said, and 2,000 more were ready to go. It was the second day that residents were allowed to leave. Previous evacuation attempts had failed, with Ukrainian authorities accusing Russia of attacking the city and even routes to be used by civilians, despite agreeing to ceasefires.
But, again, no humanitarian aid was allowed into the city. Sergei Orlov, the deputy mayor of Mariupol, said things were ""getting more difficult by the hour"". 
""The situation is horrible,"" he said. ""There isn't enough food, water, medicine, insulin, baby food. Everyone has specific needs."" According to Mr Orlov, cars with supplies have been waiting for four days but the Russians have not let it in. ""We get a lot of calls. For example, a mother who says 'I have a child in my hands [who] is dying from hunger.' Or we get a call 'Here's our address. We're blocked in the basement. What should we do?',"" Mr Orlov said.
""Unfortunately,"" he said, ""we can't do anything.""
Back in the basement, the family told Mr Kozyrkov they could hear the sound of explosions nearby but that their building remained intact. There is one generator which they use to recharge their phones and, from time to time, they venture outside to make some calls.
""The shelling doesn't stop,"" he said. ""They're very frightened.""
Ms Ponomareva said the situation was ""very difficult, to put it mildly."" People need a humanitarian corridor, she said. ""Otherwise, it's a slow death from hunger and thirst.""

478,478,Ukraine UK refugee hosting scheme: Mum-of-four opens home to refugees,"Tue, 15 Mar 2022 16:46:14 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-60737095,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-60737095?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,"Mandi Arnold, 35, says welcoming more people into her busy home will mean ""more love, more memories"".","Ukraine UK refugee hosting scheme: Mum-of-four opens home to refugees
Mandi Arnold with her two youngest children, Presley and Phoenix
Two days before Russia invaded Ukraine, Mandi and John Arnold were curled up on the sofa of their home in Shropshire, streaming a film about the Chernobyl nuclear disaster on Netflix.  
It struck a nerve with the mum-of-four - she and John were both born in 1986, the same year as the disaster. So later that week when Mandi saw news of millions of Ukrainians fleeing their homes to escape Russian attacks, including in the Chernobyl area, she jumped at the chance to help.
""From the moment this all started to evolve, my heart just went straight out to them and I thought if I could help anyone I would do so without any reservations,"" she says.
On Monday evening Mandi, 35, was among the almost 90,000 people to register their interest in a new visa scheme allowing people in the UK to host Ukrainian refugees in their own homes.
Many of those who have signed up to help are doing so because their children have all grown up, left home and they've got some extra space.
But Mandi's house is a pretty hectic place to be. She and John live with their sons, one-year-old Presley and four-year-old Phoenix, and Mandi's nine-year-old daughter, Amalia - not to mention pet cat Nala and Oakley the Labrador. Mandi's 19-year-old daughter, who's studying in Scotland, is also ""in and out"" of the house.
""It's quite a busy household anyway, it's constantly on the go,"" Mandi says.
""Adding more would just be more love, more memories.""
How to sponsor Ukrainian refugees in UK homes
How can Ukrainian refugees come to the UK?
89,000 sign up to UK's refugee site
The family will free up one of the bedrooms for refugees to live in. They'll bring in an old single bed from the garage and have space for a child as well as an adult, if needed.
Mandi and John's sons aren't quite old enough to understand that they'll be sharing their home with strangers in the near future, but Mandi has explained it to her daughter, Amalia. She's excited about meeting new people and will ""welcome anyone with open arms"", Mandi says.
Under the newly-launched Homes for Ukraine scheme, UK households can offer a space for a refugee to live for at least six months.
Each host household will be offered £350 a month, tax-free, as a ""thank you"" payment. They won't be expected to provide food and living expenses, but can choose to offer this. 
Mandi says her daughter Amalia (left) is excited to meet any refugees. Her younger brothers Presley (centre) and Phoenix will share a room to make more space
Mandi fled an abusive relationship when she was younger, leaving her network of friends and family behind to start a new life.
To begin with she had nowhere to call home, so lived in hotels for months.
She and John scraped the money together from what he'd saved up from his business selling private number plates.
Mandi says she knows fleeing a warzone is ""completely different"" to what she went through, but she can relate to the feeling of disconnect many Ukrainian refugees might have as they step foot on UK soil for the first time.
""I know the feeling of removing yourself from somewhere that you once called home, or once felt secure and safe,"" she says.
""I've been in times of struggle, I've been in situations where I really needed someone to help. To know that I've overcome that and got to where I am now, I know it's something that can be achieved and all it takes is time and love. And these people deserve that.""
By moving Presley in with Phoenix, this room in the Arnold's home can be freed up for refugees
Mandi says she thinks the whole family will benefit from taking in Ukrainian refugees.
""My kids, they've got all the love to give and we don't have much family. I'm not saying I'm going to grab [the refugees] and say 'you're my family now,' but they will be welcomed as a family member,"" she says.
""I've got a lot of love to give and it's the perfect opportunity to give it to someone who's in need.""
Top tips on being a refugee host family...
...from people across the UK who have hosted refugees or asylum seekers in their own homes in the past: 
1. Be prepared for the mental impact. Lucy Stevens, near Colchester: It is likely people will be very traumatised. Our foster son was highly traumatised and required a lot of input with regards to mental health [which] also has an impact on your own family.
2. Find people who match your stage of life. Ruth Elphinston, Birmingham: If you've got young kids, bring in families with young kids. Or if your kids have left home, think about hosting a young adult. It makes things easier as they'll fit in with the way you're living your life already.
3. Lean on your community. Ruth: Ask neighbours and friends to help you out. They could maybe show your refugees around the area, offer them work, or have you all over for a meal.
4. Think about ground rules. Alison Baxter, Oxford. Sharing the sitting room, smoking and if you will cook for them are all points to consider. It's better to set down clear guidance because your guest is going to be anxious if you just say ""make yourself at home"".
5. Give them space. Robert and Margaret Spooner, Sheffield: Don't force your guests to speak about their experiences. Instead focus on finding common bonds, as well as giving them the chance to do small jobs or make food to take their mind off things.
6. Get the GP sorted early. Karina Litvack, London: I've never found access to the NHS to be a problem for the refugees I've helped, but you sometimes have to book an interpreter which takes longer. 
7. Don't feel bad about saying no. Justyna Bell, Belfast: Have a conversation with your entire household before you decide for sure about taking someone in. Really open up and don't think it's not very humanitarian if you have some objections.

Watch: Anti-war demonstrator disrupts Russia's state TV news
Russian state TV's Channel One plays a crucial part in the Kremlin's media messaging. It is Russia's second most popular channel, and its flagship news programme Vremya (Time) is watched by millions.
Normally, there is no room for deviation from the party line.
So when Marina Ovsyannikova ran on to the set behind the news anchor in prime time, brandishing a poster saying ""Stop the War!"", it was an unprecedented moment of dissent against the Kremlin which reached into living rooms across the country.
Ms Ovsyannikova, who has a Ukrainian father and Russian mother, has been fined 30,000 roubles (£214, $280) for an anti-war video she had also released.
Her protest is extraordinary in more ways than one. 
To start with, Channel One viewers are not even used to hearing the word ""war"" used to describe Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The government has ordered the media to call it a ""special military operation"" launched to ""demilitarise and denazify"" Ukraine.
Ms Ovsyannikova's protest also targeted the core President Putin supporters: most Russians still use state TV as their main source of news, rather than from reports in the diminishing number of independent websites or from social media. 
It soon emerged that Ms Ovsyannikova was a Channel One editor who had earlier recorded a video statement
Staging a protest like this takes extraordinary courage. Ten days earlier, Russia approved a law under which anyone challenging the Kremlin's version of events in Ukraine can face up to 15 years in jail. 
Almost 15,000 anti-war protesters have been detained since the invasion began, according to the Ovd-info website. None of them have reached into as many Russia homes as Ms Ovsyannikova did.
Beyond a few seconds of exposure on Channel One, state media have ignored the protest. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has dismissed her action as hooliganism.
For fear of being targeted, independent Russian websites have blurred out or pixelated Ms Ovsyannikova's poster. 
Novaya Gazeta, for example, left only one line from her poster still legible: ""Don't believe propaganda.""
Independent website Novaya Gazeta left only one line of the poster unblurred
It is a different story on social media, where this anti-Putin moment has been seen as a glimmer of hope in an otherwise bleak Russian media landscape. 
""Marina Ovsyannikova is a hero of Russia!"" opposition politician Ilya Yashin said on Twitter.
""Five seconds of truth can wash away the dirt of weeks of propaganda,"" said another opposition politician, Lev Shlosberg.
Her protest is not the only crack to appear in the Kremlin media machine's campaign to convince Russians that the operation in Ukraine is neither a war nor an invasion.
Lilia Gildeyeva had worked for NTV since 2006
News broke hours afterwards that a veteran presenter from another top television channel, NTV, had left the country.
""First, I left [Russia] because I was afraid they would not let me go just like that, then I submitted my resignation,"" Lilia Gildeyeva told a prominent blogger.

480,480,Ukraine war: One shell that destroyed a family,"Tue, 15 Mar 2022 06:00:27 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-60742263,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-60742263?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,A woman recounts the moment her husband and son were killed by a Russian shell in the town of Irpin.,"Ukraine war: One shell that destroyed a family
Myhailo and Maryna with their grandson, who survived the attack
""He was everything I could ever dream of, an example of what a man should be,"" says Maryna. ""He was the centre of our family, our fortress and our heart. He made my most secret dreams come true.""
Maryna's husband of 34 years, Myhailo, was killed by Russian forces on 6 March, in the commuter town of Irpin, on the outskirts of Kyiv. 
This is the story of one shell that hit one flat and destroyed one family, but almost three weeks into Russia's invasion there are countless other families like this across Ukraine. Maryna wants to tell her story for the sake of Myhailo, 54, and their son Serhiy, aged 32, who was also killed in the attack.
Warning: Some readers may find details in this story distressing.
Serhiy died in his mother's arms
We speak via video call, as Maryna is now sheltering with distant relatives in western Ukraine, along with her daughter Yanna and her grandson. The three-year-old is named Myhailo, after the grandfather he adored. 
Maryna appears on my screen looking drawn and wearing black. And her words pour out, in a torrent of pain, grief and anger.
""When a person is killed somewhere, ""she tells me, ""the police look for the killer. There is a court case. The person is punished. Now it's not just one person being killed, it's many. The nation is being killed. I want the world to see who is doing this so that Putin and his regime bear the blame for the killing of my beloved ones.""
This is the second time Russia's shadow has enveloped Maryna and her family
When the Russians began targeting Irpin, Maryna, her husband and son left their flat and moved to her daughter's home nearby. On the day of the attack, repeated shelling drove them down to the underground car park.
In the evening it was quieter, so they went up to the apartment on the 15th floor to collect some food and give her grandson a bath. 
""We did everything quickly, ""she said, ""then we heard a thunderclap. Myhailo and Serhiy pushed us away - me, my daughter and my grandson. We managed to get out, but they didn't. I felt whistling in my ears, and something hot on my skin. I didn't know what had happened, but I knew I was alive.""
A shell had hit the bedroom of the flat, and blown it away, from corner to corner.

Outside in the corridor she started calling for her family and found her daughter and grandson, by touch. They were scared but unharmed - saved by a mattress which fell on top of them. ""I started calling my husband and son,"" she says. ""I was calling 'Serhiy, Misha'. My son replied. I followed his voice and found the flat. My husband was at the front step. If he had made it just a few more inches, out of the flat, that would have saved his life. The entire concrete wall fell on him.""
Serhiy was alive, just. ""My son was screaming 'Mum don't come here. Run! Run away from here and take Yanna and the baby with you."" I realised he could not move. I said: 'Darling please wait, I will come back for you.'""
Maryna, Yanna and little Myhailo felt their way downstairs through the smoke and dust - step by terrified step. Down in the car park she begged neighbours to help. ""The men went first, ""she said, ""in the blink of an eye. They came down and said someone was alive but there was nothing they could do. I asked for sheets and bandages and said I would go there myself,"" Maryna recounts.

""A woman doctor came with me. We found my son, still fully conscious. His stomach was ripped open, and his legs were broken. He said 'Mum, I can't stand it. Kill me now. My son died in my arms, not asking for anything, just cursing Putin."" 
Serhiy's plans died with him - his hopes of settling down and having a family. ""I will never be able to see my son's children,"" says Maryna. ""Putin did not just kill my son and my husband. He killed my family.""
The bereft wife and mother has her own name for the Russian leader's ""special military operation"" as he calls it. She says it is a ""special shelling operation"". One house shelled might be a fluke, she argues, but not hundreds of houses all over Ukraine. She says the Russians targeted houses deliberately in Irpin. 
""The tanks moved from one place to another, to get the best view,"" she tells me.
Most of Irpin's population has left
The 53-year-old angrily rejects Vladimir Putin's claim that his mission is to protect Russian speakers. ""He didn't need to rescue me,"" she says. ""I have never been oppressed. I have been speaking Russian all my life. I could travel. I could speak the language I wanted. I have started speaking Ukrainian as a form of protest (as have many others). Putin has taught me to love my homeland even more.""
This is the second time Russia's long shadow has enveloped Maryna and her family. In 2014 she and Myhailo had just settled into their ""dream home"" in the Donetsk region of eastern Ukraine, when Kremlin-backed rebels went to war with the Ukrainian government. They had to flee and settled in Irpin where history - or Russia's version of it - repeated itself. 
In a bitter irony, many who fled the East started new lives in Irpin and neighbouring Bucha - both of which have suffered relentless Russian bombardment. 
Maryna says each day is harder now, as her loss seeps through to the bone. ""You wake in the morning and the person you are closest to is not there, the one who always said, 'good morning' and made you a cup of coffee. There's no-one who can come and hug you if you aren't in a good mood."" 
Maryna says her grandson is now afraid of loud noises, and asks if it is ""the bad guys shooting""
Myhailo was a mechanical engineer and adored his family. ""He was a father unlike many, perhaps because he spent all his time with his children,"" Maryna says. ""When the grandson was born, he was the same with him. He taught him so many things"".
She says she and Myhailo were ""big dreamers"", always planning for the future. Now in place of dreams, there is gnawing worry for the family she has left. 
""My grandson doesn't know his grandfather and uncle have passed away,"" she says. ""He is afraid of noise. When he hears a sound, he asks if it's the bad guys shooting. I need to save my daughter and grandson and get them away from the war.""
For a short time it seemed they had outrun the threat by getting to the city of Lviv, close to the Polish border. But early on Sunday morning it too was attacked, with a cruise missile strike killing 35 people at a military training base. 
In Ukraine it is now safe to assume that nowhere is safe.
Having been robbed of her husband and son, Maryna is begging Western nations to impose a no-fly zone. ""I am asking you to shield the sky over Ukraine,"" she says. ""Don't let them shoot at us. Ukraine is protecting all of Europe, and we will not manage this alone.""
three-year-old Myhailo is named after his grandfather, who was a devoted family man
Ten days on, Irpin remains under fire, and most of the town's 60,000 residents have fled. Myhailo and Serhiy still lie unburied in the ruins of the flat - a torment for Maryna. 
""My husband and son are still in that room,"" she says. ""I could not bury them by myself. There is no funeral service, no doctors, and no morgue. I hope there is a way to bury them, with their names on the graves. I want there to be a cross, and I want to go to visit.""
One shell, one flat and one family hold up a mirror to the brutality of Russia's invasion, and the agony of Ukraine.

481,481,What sanctions are being imposed on Russia over Ukraine invasion?,"Tue, 15 Mar 2022 14:48:36 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-60125659,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-60125659?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,Western nations have imposed severe sanctions on Russia over its invasion of Ukraine.,"What are the sanctions on Russia and have they affected its economy?
The US, UK and EU have announced new sanctions on Russia, two years after its invasion of Ukraine.
The measures also marked a week since the death in custody of opposition leader Alexei Navalny.
What are sanctions?
Sanctions are penalties imposed by one country on another, to stop them acting aggressively or breaking international law.
They are among the toughest measures nations can take, short of going to war. 
What are the latest sanctions on Russia?
Announcing 500 new sanctions against Russia, US President Joe Biden said they would target Russia's war machine. Export restrictions will be imposed on nearly 100 firms or individuals.
President Biden said the measures would also target people connected with the imprisonment of Mr Navalny, who died in an Arctic penal camp. 
The UK has frozen the assets of six bosses at the prison and banned them from travelling to the UK. 
The UK has also imposed new bans on Russian metal, diamond and energy exports.
The EU has announced sanctions on 200 organisations and people, external which it says are helping Russia acquire weapons, or taking Ukrainian children from their homes. 
The sanctions include companies and individuals involved in shipping North Korean armaments to Russia.
Alexei Navalny: What we know about his death 
What other sanctions have been imposed on Russia?
Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the US, UK and EU, along with countries including Australia, Canada and Japan, have imposed more than 16,500 sanctions on Russia, external.
Their main target has been Russia's money.
Foreign currency reserves worth $350bn (£276bn) - about half its total reserves - were frozen.
About 70% of the assets of Russian banks, external were also frozen, the EU says, and some were excluded from Swift, a high-speed messaging service for financial institutions.
Western nations have also:
banned exports of technology Russia might use for making weapons
banned imports of gold and diamonds from Russia 
banned flights from Russia
sanctioned oligarchs - the wealthy business people linked with the Kremlin  - and impounded their yachts
Roman Abramovich, former owner of Chelsea FC, is one oligarch who has been sanctioned
Russia's oil industry has been another major target.
The US and UK banned Russian oil and natural gas. The EU has banned seaborne crude imports.
The G7 - an organisation of the world's seven largest ""advanced"" economies - has imposed a maximum price of $60 (£47) a barrel, external on Russian crude oil, to try to reduce its earnings.
Which Western companies have left Russia?
Hundreds of major firms, including McDonald's, Coca-Cola, Starbucks and Heineken, have stopped selling and making goods in Russia. 
However, some still do business in Russia. 
PepsiCo, for example, has been accused of continuing to sell food products in Russia. And the BBC discovered that US cosmetics firm Avon was making goods in a factory near Moscow.
How has Russia evaded sanctions?
President Vladimir Putin has claimed European sanctions have done Russia no harm, saying: ""We have growth, and they have decline."", external
Russia has managed to sell oil abroad for more than the G7's price cap, external, according to the Atlantic Council, a US think tank. It says a ""shadow fleet"" of about 1,000 tankers is used to ship it, external.
The International Energy Agency says Russia is still exporting 8.3 million barrels of oil a day, external - having increased supplies to India and China.
Russia is also able to import many sanctioned Western goods, external by buying them through countries such as Georgia, Belarus and Kazakhstan, according to researchers at King's College London. 
China has been a vital supplier of alternative hi-tech products to those produced in the West, says Dr Maria Snegovaya from the US think tank, the Center for Strategic and International Studies.
""China sells it chips and other components it needs to for keep its military production going,"" she says. ""Russia wouldn't be able to pull that off without China's help.""
Russian oil getting into UK via refinery loophole
What support is China giving Russia? 
What impact have sanctions had on Russia's economy?
In 2022, the first year of the war, Russia's economy shrank by 2.1%, external, according to the International Monetary Fund.
However, it estimates that Russia's economy grew by 2.2% in 2023 and predicts growth of 1.1% in 2024.
Nevertheless, the US Treasury claims sanctions are damaging Russia, having cut 5% from the economic growth, external it might have had over the past two years.
But Dr Snegovaya suggests: ""Sanctions have not made waging this war sufficiently costly for Russia, and that means it can continue with it for some time to come"".
The US Treasury also says that the war in Ukraine and sanctions have led more than a million people, external - many of them young and highly educated - to leave Russia. 
Russia's government has also been slashing health spending to fund the war in Ukraine, according to the UK's Ministry of Defence, external. 
""This mainly hits people in rural areas,"" says James Nixey of foreign affairs think tank Chatham House. ""The government makes cuts there rather than in the major cities, where they might cause uprisings.""

President Zelensky appears before a meeting of the Joint Expeditionary Force of northern European countries
The war in Ukraine continues to dominate the front pages, with The Times leading on President Zelensky's admission that Ukraine is unlikely to be able to join Nato. Addressing a meeting of northern European leaders on Tuesday, Mr Zelensky said Nato's ""open door"" appeared to be closed to Ukraine and that this ""must be acknowledged"". The front also features a picture of a mother and daughter currently making their way to the UK. They will be among the first to be granted entry under a new refugee sponsorship scheme.
The Telegraph similarly leads on President Zelensky's comments, calling them a ""significant concession that opened the way for a potential peace deal with Russia"". Alongside, there is a picture of Marina Ovsyannikova, an editor at a Russian state broadcaster, leaving court after receiving a fine for speaking out against the war in Ukraine.
The Express describes President Zelensky's Nato concession as a ""glimmer of hope"" as the southern Ukrainian city of Mariupol remains under siege and the death toll from the conflict continues to rise. It also reports that a total of 122,000 Britons have so far offered to house Ukrainian refugees.

A picture of the family of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who has been held in Iran for the last six years ago, makes the front page of the Guardian. It follows news that she could be released within days. The paper also reports on a new 35-hour curfew in Ukrainian capital Kyiv after it says at least five people were killed in the latest Russian bombardment.
The Mail's front page describes Ukraine capital Kyiv as a ""city of fear and defiance"". It says citizens in the city now wake to the sound of ""thunderous air strikes"" but they are preparing to face down Russian forces with ""awesome fortitude"".
'Putin turns to Plan C', reads the front page of the i. The paper reports that Russia is preparing for a ""war of attrition"" involving sustained bombing of cities and infrastructure. It also reports on a visit to Kyiv by the prime ministers of Poland, Slovenia and the Czech Republic.
The Financial Times says that the West is ""turning up the heat on Moscow"" following a raft of new sanctions. The paper reports that the EU has added names including that of Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich to an asset freeze and travel ban, while the UK has imposed sanctions on more than 370 oligarchs. In the US, the state department has announced measures against 11 senior figures in Russia's defence sector.
There is hope that Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe is set to be released from detention in Iran
""You're not blinging anymore,"" the Metro tells Russia's richest. The paper reports that in the UK the new sanctions will include a ban on the export of luxury goods, including high-end cars, fashion and art, to Russia. It also says that Mr Abramovich is thought to have returned to Moscow on a private jet after he was spotted at an Israeli airport.
The Sun reports that Woody Johnson, the billionaire owner of American football team The New York Jets and the former US ambassador to the UK, wants to make a last-minute bid to buy Chelsea. The paper says Mr Johnson hopes to ""steal the deal"" from a Saudi group before the Friday deadline.
And the Star's front page tells the story of a President Zelensky lookalike who has reportedly escaped Ukraine with the help of lookalikes of Russian president Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un.

Volunteers are racing medical supplies from the UK to the Ukrainian front line.
Over two days, 1,000 miles and six countries, they transported vans loaded with trauma kits, oxygen regulators and ultrasound machines a thousand miles east in just two days.
The BBC's Jim Reed travelled with the team.
The convoy, organised by the Ukrainian Medical Association of the UK, is made of Ukrainian doctors and nurses working in the UK.
Both the World Health Organization and the UK government have already delivered hundreds of tonnes of supplies to hospitals in Kyiv and other cities.

484,484,Stormzy tour review: Star praises fans who waited two years to see him,"Wed, 16 Mar 2022 01:56:06 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-60756983,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-60756983?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,The star thanks fans who held onto tickets for two years as his Heavy Is The Head tour launches.,"Stormzy tour review: Star praises fans who waited two years to see him
The star donned a Newcastle United t-shirt that was thrown onstage by a fan
""This is that expensive rap,"" says Stormzy, half-way through the track Rachael's Little Brother. ""It's coming like a dying art.""
The lyric isn't a monetary reference, he's explained, external, but a metaphor for the sort of ""classy, skilled, catching-all-the-pockets"" lyricism he aspires to.
And yet… he's not afraid to loosen the purse strings when circumstances demand.
Take, for example, the star's first UK arena tour, which hit Newcastle on Tuesday night. 
Put together by the teams behind Beyoncé's historic Coachella set and Stormzy's 2019 Glastonbury performance, it's a lavish, no-corners-cut, stage and light show that asserts the Stormzy's status as the country's biggest rapper.
This is the sort of show that makes room for pyrotechnics in almost every song; alongside a 12-piece band, a two-pronged catwalk, five budget-busting video screens and - symbolism ahoy - a serpentine lighting rig that twists into the shape of a crown.
But for all that spectacle, the main focus is the man born Michael Owuo Jr - from the moment he emerges on a swaying platform, high above the arena floor; to the closing bars of Vossi Bop, where his vocals are drowned out by 11,000 phone-wielding fans.

He opens the show with a trio of his fiercest songs - Big Michael, Audacity and Know Me From - high-stepping through fireworks as he whips the crowd into a frenzy.
For the first half an hour, he's the only person on the stage, his charismatic swagger the show's sole source of energy (if it could be bottled, it could presumably solve the fuel crisis).
Acknowledging that all eyes are on him, the ultra HD video screens emphasise his lyrics - especially on the punchy First Things First, which tackles everything from depression to institutional racism, via the demonisation of UK rap and his love of Adele.
After six songs, Stormzy switches up the pace with a stirring gospel-soul section that introduces a full live band, featuring no less than six backing singers.
They lead us through the star's more contemplative songs (Crown, Superheroes, Do Better) while adding a late-night urgency to the sensually-charged Cigarettes & Cush. As the tempo slows, the star lets out his playful side, flirting with the crowd and busting out some surprisingly supple dance moves. 
""We're going to create some memories tonight,"" he declares. ""I want everyone to leave here with a little bit of joy in their heart.""
To be brutally honest, the slow-groove soul revue outstays its welcome by at least two songs - and it's a relief when Stormzy ratchets the energy back up with the ferociously articulated Wiley Flow (the line ""I can't drop the bag, I am the bag,"" remains a highlight of his discography).
The pace doesn't falter after that, as the star races through his biggest hits - Clash, Big For Your Boots, Blinded By Your Grace, Shut Up and Vossi Bop. 
Some of these are performed inside a giant, oscillating scale of justice (which, like the metaphor, went completely over my head). Others are delivered, to maximum audience approval, while wearing a Newcastle United t-shirt that's been thrown onstage.
Throughout the show, Stormzy is in jubilant form, turning the Utilita Arena into a giant shoobz, or all-out grime party. For many in the audience, it was their first concert since the Covid lockdowns - a fact that wasn't lost on the star.
""A lot of you bought a ticket two years ago, so to see you here today is a real thing,"" he said. 
""The past two years for me… I've done a lot of growing as a man and I've been making music, and I've been chilling, and I've been spending time with my family, and I've been so away from everything. 
""So even driving to the arena and seeing everybody waiting outside, I was like, 'We're still here man, we're still alive.' I love you guys.""
And for all the expense and all of the spectacle, that's what endears Stormzy to his fans: The humanity of his music and his actions.
That's why the best moment of this, the first full show of his 2022 tour, came after the music finished and the house lights went up. 
Instead of being whisked away to a velvet-roped VIP area, Stormzy climbed off the stage and spent time with the people who'd waited two years to see him.
The crowd frequently threatened to swallow him whole - but he was undeterred, shaking hands and posing for selfies for as long as time would allow.
It was a personal gesture of gratitude; a sign that, for all of his stature, Stormzy knows where his power comes from. 
And he repaid that debt by announcing his forthcoming third album to them first - not on social media, or in an exclusive interview with Rolling Stone, but in a video played exclusively to the fans in the arena, external.
This is that expensive rap, and it's coming like a dying art.

Marianne Kay from Yorkshire travelled to Rzeszow in Poland to help her 79-year-old mother Antonina Kolodii to safety in the UK, using the UK Home Office's Ukraine Family Scheme. 
Now, back in the UK, they both reflect on their experiences and the difficulties of dealing with the visa application process. 
The Home Office says there have been 4,600 successful visa applications under the scheme. 
MPs have criticised the Home Office for a slow response to the flight of almost three million people from Ukraine, saying those seeking sanctuary are being held up by bureaucracy or turned away. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has described the visa programme as ""huge and very generous"", adding it could eventually help ""hundreds of thousands"" of refugees enter the UK. 
In a statement to the BBC the Home Office says: “We stand shoulder to shoulder with Ukraine and the changes we’ve made to the visa process are making it quicker and simpler for Ukrainians to come here, as well as ensuring those already here can stay.""
Watch Marianne and Antonina's story.

Douglas Smith broke his own record with the bumper crop of tomatoes from a single stem
A man has broken his own world record for growing the most tomatoes from a single stem.
Douglas Smith from Stanstead Abbotts, Hertfordshire, grew 1,269 tomatoes on a single truss last September, a feat which has just been verified by Guinness World Records. 
It beat his previous record of 839 which came from a plant that bore fruit just before the new record-breaker.
The title-holder prior to that was 488 which was set in 2010.
Mr Smith said: ""The record attempts were only a few weeks apart but it took a little bit of time for the second record to go through the system. 
""We counted up the first plant and there lurking in the background was the second one.""
With so many tomatoes he said he had been able to keep friends and family stocked up with punnets of fresh produce. 
Mr Smith said he researched different aspects to help him make the right choices for his record attempts, including taking soil samples to be tested at a laboratory to allow him to make any necessary adjustments.

In the past, Mr Smith has also grown a giant sunflower measuring 20ft (6m), a giant pumpkin and giant tomatoes. 
""With all these things you want to have a bit of a run-up. Every year I'll split it up into two main camps,"" he said.
""I want to have stuff that I'm focusing on - this year it's on the most tomatoes, but then I'll run little experiments with other giant veg and giant crops.
""They won't be the focus of the year but you want to trial and experiment so when you do have a go you're going to be a little more up to speed.""
This year's experiments are due to include peas, aubergines and potatoes.

Leah Washington told her 26,000 Instagram followers about the engagement
A couple seriously injured in a rollercoaster crash at Alton Towers have announced their engagement.
Leah Washington and Joe Pugh were both teenagers riding the Smiler when it crashed in 2015. Leah's leg was later amputated and Joe had shattered knees.
Leah showed off her engagement ring in a photo from Venice on her Instagram page.
She received thousands of likes and wrote: ""So this happened yesterday… I SAID YES.""
Joe wrote on his Instagram page ""What a great end to a long weekend in Venice… SHE SAID YES"" 
The pair, from Barnsley in South Yorkshire, were among 16 people hurt in the crash, five of them seriously, when two carriages on the ride collided in June that year.
An investigation by the Staffordshire theme park in November 2015 found it had been caused by human error.
Joe Pugh, who was 19 when the crash happened, and Leah Washington, then 18, continued dating
Theme park owner Merlin admitted breaching the Health and Safety Act and was fined £5m in September 2016.
Leah and Vicky Balch, of Leyland, Lancashire, who also lost a leg as a result of the crash, later announced they were suing Merlin for negligence and or breach of statutory duty.

Sir Rod Stewart said his Ferrari could not get through the potholes
The potholes Sir Rod Stewart was filmed fixing will be temporarily filled in April and the road resurfaced in July, a council said.

The leader of Essex County Council, Kevin Bentley, said the road ""wasn't the condition it should be in"".
In the Instagram post, external, Sir Rod claimed the road had been in need of repair ""for ages"".
Dressed in a tracksuit and high-vis vest, he explained why he and ""the boys"" decided to fix it themselves.
""The other day, there was an ambulance with a burst tyre. My Ferrari can't go through here at all,"" he said.
The rural road near Harlow in Essex has many potholes, but will now be repaired by Essex County Council
Mr Bentley, a Conservative councillor, said the road had been inspected since the videos were posted and it was agreed it needed repairing.
""The patching work will be done in April and resurfacing will be done in July,"" he said.
""We must get to our roads as quickly as we can within the financial constraints what we have.""
He encouraged residents to report potholes through the authority's website, external, so the council ""can get to them as fast as possible"".

A Labour member of the House of Lords was told off for falling asleep in the debating chamber.
Lord Young of Norwood Green wanted to take part in a debate about draft regulations on genetically modified organisms late on Monday evening.
But as he started speaking he was reprimanded by government whip Lady Bloomfield who said: ""The noble Lord was fast asleep for the entire duration of the minister's speech.""
When Lord Young started to respond Lady Bloomfield replied: ""I had to send a note to you in order to wake you up by the doorkeeper.""

494,494,The neighbourhood leading a green energy revolution,"Wed, 16 Mar 2022 03:14:13 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-60241966,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-60241966?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,A small area of Scotland is the home of a groundbreaking experiment to power homes with green hydrogen.,"The neighbourhood leading a green energy revolution
An ambitious target of using hydrogen to partly power homes in the UK within three years has been set by the National Grid, the BBC has learned. On the east coast of Scotland, a small neighbourhood is playing a key role in this energy revolution. 
From next year, about 300 homes in Buckhaven, and Methil, in the area of Levenmouth, will be powered by green hydrogen gas in a project called H100. Customers will be offered free hydrogen-ready boilers and cookers in the scheme, which will initially last five and a half years.
For the first time in its history, the National Grid (NG) plans to use something other than natural gas in its distribution network and start blending hydrogen with natural gas in the next three years.
Yet, standing in the former Fife coal mining village of Buckhaven as a cold wind howls round buildings made of local grey stone, it's hard to imagine this is the centre of a groundbreaking experiment working towards the NG's ambitions.
But as soon as you walk towards Buckhaven waterfront, it's impossible to ignore. A 200-metre wind turbine, astonishing in its size and generating green energy, stands just off the coast, making a loud swoosh every couple of seconds, as the wind is picked up and thrown into the sea.
The region has a long, proud history of energy production from its mines, but now the focus is on more environmentally friendly natural resources.
The huge wind turbine will generate electricity to power an electrolyser, which turns water into hydrogen gas and oxygen. The hydrogen will then be stored in pressurised secure tanks, before being pumped into people's homes.
The £28m project, partly funded by the Office of Gas and Electricity Markets (OFGEM), has the capability to be expanded to 1,000 homes from the same turbine.
Heating properties is thought to account for up to a third of UK carbon emissions, and the project hopes to save more than 2,650 tonnes of CO2, which is equivalent to half the homes taking their cars off the road.
Such projects are not seen as the solution by all. Recently, MPs on the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee, said the government's approach to decarbonising home heating lacked clear direction. They said current policies were not on the scale required, and rejected hydrogen as a main solution for greener home heating.
Caroline Cunningham hopes the move will help see her gas bills reduced in the long term
Meanwhile in Buckhaven, fitness instructor Caroline Cunningham, who has signed up to the project, can see the turbine from her front room.
""It's super-exciting,"" she says. ""Something that's literally a few hundred metres away from where I live, is going to send power and energy to the housing system.""
Cut fossil fuels to lower gas bills, advisers say 
Many people still in the dark over gas boilers, say MPs
Homeowners to help pay £33bn to decarbonise heating
How will Scotland heat its homes in the future?
Rising gas prices and the war in Ukraine have almost doubled Ms Cunningham's bills in just 12 months, and despite paying the same for hydrogen gas as natural gas, she thinks it will bring them down in the long term.
""Hopefully we can get a more sustainable and a more stable energy source through hydrogen energy. And of course, it's good for the environment as well,"" says Ms Cunningham, who thinks Buckhaven leading the world on renewable energy for heating and cooking will also give new life to an area that has been dominated by the coal industry for the past century.
""I think we've taken a lot from the world and it's time that we move forward now on different types of energy sources, like the hydrogen energy.""
Angus McIntosh says Scotland is blessed with natural resources to produce power
The east coast of Scotland is famous for its wind, but the town's location close to the sea - and its range of properties - made access for installing pipework simpler.
Angus McIntosh, from energy company SGN, is leading the H100 Fife project. He believes hydrogen has the ability to reduce bills in the long term. 
Currently the cost of producing low-carbon hydrogen is more expensive than buying natural gas, but Mr McIntosh believes that is about to change.
""Scotland is blessed with a lot of wind and a lot of rain and also natural resources,"" he explains. ""It's got all the ingredients to become a hydrogen exporter, as well as more than enough hydrogen to supply its people.""
Yet with industrial hydrogen production hubs still to be completed, academics doubt that this would currently work on a much larger scale.
Mr McIntosh believes the project can ""absolutely"" be scaled up: ""One of the things you've got to do to generate the interest in hydrogen production is create that market,"" he says. The project aims to prove that hydrogen is attractive to customers, while work is also taking place to map out the system transformation across the UK.
The NG's plan is to start blending at small percentages of hydrogen in 2025, but it aims to get up to 20% as soon as the hydrogen is available.
The UK government is aiming to achieve 5GW of low-carbon hydrogen production capacity by 2030 for use across the economy. This is the equivalent to the amount of gas consumed by more than three million households in the UK each year.
To do this, blue hydrogen will be required - this is where carbon is captured by filtration of natural gas. The carbon is then often buried under the sea. Environmentalists suggest this is flawed, as natural gas is still being used despite it being described as low-carbon hydrogen, of which there is no official definition.
Tony Green, hydrogen director at the NG, explains: ""Blending is taking the natural gas we have today in the network, starting with a small quantity of hydrogen, it's just another gas, we mix it up and push that down the network instead. The user won't notice any difference at all at low levels, and we will just build that level up over time.""
Some of the network's biggest pipelines, which usually carry methane across the 5,000 mile network to homes and businesses, are being tested to blend hydrogen. Eventually the grid wants to replace natural gas 
Mr Green believes there will be a point when natural gas is no longer used in the network, replaced with low-carbon hydrogen, either produced from wind or where natural gas is steamed and the CO2 emissions captured and stored.
""The beauty of hydrogen is that we can store it, and when the wind is not blowing or the sun is not shining, we can keep hold of the energy and run it around our network,"" he says.
Dr Katriona Edlmann says there is a big challenge ahead
But Dr Katriona Edlmann, a researcher on hydrogen funded by the University of Edinburgh, believes it could be the 2030s before green hydrogen is on a par cost-wise with fossil fuels.
""There's no denying we have a very big challenge ahead of us. The current generation is very minimal - even globally only 4% of our hydrogen is generated from green hydrogen - so there's a lot to do,"" she says.
""We just need to make it bigger, we need to do more of it. We need to create the hydrogen market which we can do through blending, and as the market grows, industry will invest in this. Industry will come, they will do the work. If the market is there, the hydrogen will be generated. But we're not quite there yet.""

495,495,Brittney Griner: How can a US basketball star just vanish?,"Tue, 15 Mar 2022 23:25:37 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-60701050,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-60701050?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,"Brittney Griner, widely considered the best female player of all time, has been detained in Russia.","Brittney Griner: How can a US basketball star just vanish?
Family and friends of the star were initially quiet about her detention
She's arguably the greatest female basketball player of all time, and she was detained in Moscow amid the war in Ukraine. After two months in custody, the world is now paying more attention to her case. 
In one of the last public sightings of Brittney Griner, captured on CCTV, the American professional basketball player is seen walking through airport security trailing a small, black suitcase. 
Ms Griner, a star centre for the Phoenix Mercury, had landed at the Sheremetyevo airport, outside Moscow, in February. She was in Russia to play during the WNBA off-season.
In the security footage, she wears running shoes, black sweatpants and a black hoodie with ""Black Lives for Peace"" written on the back, her dark hair hanging in locs down past her shoulders. 
At 6ft 9in - tall even by basketball standards - she towers above the customs agents and other travellers.
In another shot, she is seen sitting in front of a man, seemingly a customs agent, shaking her head ""no"". Then, nothing - until a Russian mugshot emerged on state television.
Ms Griner, 31, had been arrested by Russian authorities on drug charges. 
On 14 June, state-owned Russian outlet TASS reported that her pre-trial detention had been extended until 2 July.
Citing unnamed sources, TASS has also reported that Russia hopes to trade Ms Griner for an arms trafficker serving a 25-year sentence in the US, Viktor Bout. 
Asked about this report, the US State Department said it ""would not comment on speculation"". 
""What we will say is that using the practice of wrongful detention as a bargaining chip represents a threat to the safety of everyone travelling, working, and living abroad. The United States opposes this practice everywhere,"" a spokesman said. 
The uncertainty around her fate has fuelled an outpouring of support for the player. And it has also engendered a sense of outrage among some fans who say the response to Ms Griner's detainment was, at first, strangely muted.
Following her arrest, fans and experts said that they felt the attention she was given in comparison to male players exposed longstanding gender inequities in professional sports. 
""If this was an NBA [professional men's league] player of her calibre... this would be on the cover of not only every sports page but every news media page in the world,"" said Tamryn Spruill, a sports journalist who is writing a book on the WNBA and Ms Griner's contributions to the league. 
Brittney Griner is thought to have been detained for nearly four weeks
Ms Griner, a nine-year veteran of the league - is the ""best of the best"", said Melissa Isaacson, a sportswriter and professor at Northwestern University in the US state of Illinois. 
""She's every bit the Tom Brady of her sport,"" Ms Isaacson said. ""You could argue very accurately that she is one of the best athletes in the world."" 
A native of Houston, Texas, she earned a basketball scholarship to Baylor University where she led the team to a national championship. 
She is now one of the WNBA's most dominant players in history, widely considered the best offensive player in the league.
Few have accomplished what Ms Griner has done - winning a college championship, WNBA and Euroleague titles and an Olympic gold medal. And, famously, her ability to dunk is unmatched.
Off the court, she has also been seen as a trailblazer, coming out as gay at age 22, just around the time of her entry into professional sport.
She then became the first overall draft pick in the WNBA that year and, soon after, the first openly gay athlete to be endorsed by Nike. 
""Before Griner, there was this shadow over the league, where it was like 'don't say gay,'"" Ms Spruill said. ""And she was just like 'screw that, this is who I am'.""  
""BG's always been one to be a pioneer,"" Griner's teammate, Diana Taurasi has said. 
Brittney Griner was the first openly gay athlete to be endorsed by Nike
Despite all this, Ms Griner had a second job, and that was why she had flown to Russia - to play for EuroLeague team UMMC Ekaterinburg, where she had worked since 2014 during the US off-season. 
Roughly half of WNBA players compete overseas in the off-season. For most, it's a way to augment their domestic income: WNBA players receive roughly five times more in Russia than they do in the US. 
""If she were Steph Curry or LeBron James, she wouldn't be over there at all because she'd be making enough money,"" Ms Spruill said.  
Ms Griner's counterparts in the men's league make more than 200 times the maximum WNBA salary. 
Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine on 24 February, the EuroLeague suspended all Russian teams and US and WNBA officials began calling players out of the country.
But it was too late for Brittney Griner, who is believed to have entered Russia one week earlier, on 17 February, though the timing remains unclear. 
The Russian Federal Customs Service said in a press release that a sniffer dog had led authorities to search the carry-on luggage of an American basketball player and that it had found vape cartridges containing hashish oil. A state-owned Russian news agency, Tass, identified the player as Ms Griner. 
Russian authorities only confirmed her detention the third week of March, though they disclosed she was stopped at the airport in February. 
Griner is the first woman in the league to consistently dunk
Initially, US authorities and representatives for Brittney Griner were largely silent, other than to say they were working to bring her home. 
In early May, however, the State Department said it considers Ms Griner to be ""wrongfully"" detained. 
The case is now reportedly being handled by a special departmental section that specialises in helping release Americans held hostage or wrongfully imprisoned overseas. 
On 13 May, the US State Department said a consular official the court hearing in which her hearing was extended, and spoke to Griner briefly.
A spokesman said Griner was doing ""as well as can be expected during exceedingly difficult circumstances"".
US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in April that American officials are ""doing everything we can"" to help her.
""There's only so much I can say given the privacy considerations at this point,"" Mr Blinken said. 
Ms Griner's agent, Lindsay Colas, has said she was in ""close contact"" with the player and her lawyer in Russia, but could not comment further. 
While there is no indication that Ms Griner's arrest was connected to the invasion of Ukraine, some US officials have indicated strained US-Russian relations may jeopardise her safe return.
""We don't want Ms Griner to become a pawn in the political battle that's being waged throughout the world right now,"" said US congressman John Garamendi, a member of the House of Representatives' armed services committee. 
""The war in Ukraine has essentially severed diplomatic ties between the US and Russia,"" Mr Garamendi said. ""That is going to exacerbate this issue."" 
She could face up to 10 years in prison if convicted on drug charges. 
The US embassy in Russia did not respond to a request for comment. 
The basketball star has remained dominant in WNBA since her rookie year
As Ms Griner's detention grinds on, some fans have been left incredulous by an apparent lack of attention for a world-class athlete in prison among sports media. 
Some have speculated that the silence was intentional - an effort to avoid inflaming an already precarious situation amid negotiations with Russia.
But others, like Ms Spruill, say the somewhat muffled initial coverage on Ms Griner lays bare the clear inequities faced by female athletes. 
Much more ink has been devoted to male players - whether it is American football player's Tom Brady's on-again, off-again retirement, Novak Djokovic's Covid saga in Australia, or Aaron Rodger's vaccination status - than to Brittney Griner, Ms Spruill points out.
More than 260,000 fans have signed an online petition, organised by Ms Spruill, demanding the US government prioritise her safe return and treat her like ""any other sports icon"". 
""There has absolutely not been enough coverage,"" Ms Spruill said. ""It's hard for me to read that other than a choice by the broader media."" 
Ms Griner's wife, Cherelle, posted on Instagram in April about the painful wait. 
""People say 'stay busy.' Yet, there's not a task in this world that could keep any of us from worrying about you. My heart, our hearts, are all skipping beats everyday that goes by,"" she wrote. 
""There are no words to express this pain. I'm hurting, we're hurting"".

496,496,Why is turning to Saudi Arabia for oil so controversial?,"Tue, 15 Mar 2022 18:54:05 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-58930311,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-58930311?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,"Nations like the US and UK need to keep in with Saudi Arabia, as they turn away from Russian oil.","Why is turning to Saudi Arabia for oil so controversial?
UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has defended a trip to Saudi Arabia, saying ""the widest coalition"" is needed to end reliance on Russian oil and gas.
But maintaining close ties with the Gulf kingdom is controversial among critics of its human rights record.
Why is Saudi Arabia so important for oil?
The US, UK and EU have announced that they will buy less Russian oil and gas, because of its invasion of Ukraine. However, prices have rocketed.
Saudi Arabia is the largest producer in the oil cartel Opec and has the spare capacity to help lower prices by increasing supplies, external.
It means Western countries need its goodwill and to keep on friendly terms with its ruling family.  
PM defends Saudi trip despite human rights record
Use of the death penalty
Saudi Arabia is among the countries carrying out the most executions.
In March it executed 81 men in a single day - more than during the whole of last year. They were convicted of ""multiple heinous crimes"", including terrorism, kidnapping and rape, state news agency SPA said.
Rights organisations say many do not receive fair trials in Saudi Arabia, an allegation the government rejects.
Murder of a dissident journalist
Saudi Arabia's international standing was severely damaged by the 2018 killing of Jamal Khashoggi, a US-based Saudi journalist who was a prominent critic of the government.
UN-appointed human rights expert Agnes Callamard said Saudi agents had ""used state means to execute Mr Khashoggi, external"" at its Istanbul consulate.
Saudi Arabia's de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, and other senior officials were incriminated. Although the crown prince denied any involvement, his reputation was badly tarnished.

Mohammed bin Salman is asked: ""Did you order the murder of Jamal Khashoggi?""
After the kingdom's Public Investment Fund was allowed to buy an 80% stake in Newcastle United, Mr Khashoggi's fiancée, Hatice Cengiz, called the takeover ""heart-breaking"".
OVERVIEW: The other companies owned by Newcastle's buyers
Jailing of women's rights activists 
Loujain al-Hathloul was released in February after after almost three years in detention
In 2018, Saudi authorities arrested 13 women's rights activists who had led a campaign to lift a ban on women driving.
At least four of the women were allegedly tortured and sexually harassed by interrogators, external.
In 2020, a terrorism tribunal found the most prominent activist, Loujain al-Hathloul, guilty of crimes against the state. 
After the original sentence was upheld at an appeal, external, Amnesty International's Lynn Maalouf said: ""By failing to quash Loujain al-Hathloul's conviction, the Saudi Arabian authorities have clearly demonstrated that they consider peaceful activism a crime."" 
Crackdown on intellectuals, clerics and reformists
Areej al-Sadhan said her brother Abdul Rahman was tortured before being jailed for 20 years for writing satirical tweets that criticised authorities
Women's rights activists have not been the only people detained as part of a crackdown against critics in Saudi Arabia, where political parties, trade unions and independent human rights groups are banned. 
Dozens of human rights defenders, intellectuals, academics, clerics and reformists have also been arrested since 2017, merely for exercising their right to freedom of expression, according to international human rights organisations, external. 
Many have faced what Amnesty International has said were grossly unfair trials, external on vague terrorism and cybercrime charges, and received harsh sentences, including the death penalty. 
Days before the Newcastle United takeover, a court upheld a 20-year prison sentence handed to Saudi-American aid worker Abdul Rahman al-Sadhan for writing satirical tweets criticising the authorities.
His sister, Areej, said he was ""brutally tortured"" before his conviction.
The devastating war in Yemen
The war in Yemen has triggered what the UN says is the world's worst humanitarian crisis
Saudi Arabia has been heavily criticised for a military campaign in neighbouring Yemen that has caused a humanitarian catastrophe.
A Saudi-led coalition intervened in 2015 after Yemeni rebels seized control of much of the west of the country and forced the president to flee abroad.
More than 100,000 people have reportedly been killed in the fighting, external.
Tens of thousands are also estimated to have died from indirect causes, such as lack of food, health services and infrastructure. A partial blockade by the coalition has hampered efforts to help the 20 million people in need of humanitarian aid.
UN experts say both sides in the conflict may have committed war crimes, external, though the coalition has insisted it is abiding by the rules of war.
Punishment of same-sex relations 
Although Saudi Arabia has no laws regarding sexual orientation or gender identity, sexual relations outside marriage, including homosexual sex, are strictly prohibited. 
Under the country's interpretation of Islamic law, the death penalty is a possible punishment for same-sex sexual conduct, external. 
It is also illegal for men to ""behave like women"" or to wear women's clothes, and vice versa.
An anti-cybercrime law criminalises online activity that goes against public order and religious morals.
In July 2020, a court sentenced a Yemeni blogger to 10 months in prison and then deportation, external for posting a video calling for equal rights, including for gay people.
LGBTQ+ fans hope Saudi deal is a sign for change

497,497,Ukraine war: The Telegram group tracing missing relatives,"Wed, 16 Mar 2022 00:24:49 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-60678083,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-60678083?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,A group of women work 24/7 to help find loved ones separated by the war in Ukraine.,"Ukraine war: The women tracing missing relatives
Katya Osadcha set up the group
Thousands of families have been separated in the chaos of fighting in Ukraine. Power cuts and disruption to internet and mobile phone services mean many have gone weeks without hearing news of loved ones in areas hit by intense Russian shelling.
Sergey was sheltering with his family in a bomb shelter when he left to get food. Fierce fighting meant he couldn't get back to them, and the next day his phone went dead.
Desperate for news, his brother Vladimir turned to a Telegram group set by a Ukrainian TV presenter which shares information about missing people. 
The group, called Search for the Missing, has grown to more than 80,000 members since it launched earlier this month, and receives thousands of pleas for help every day.
Hours after he posted about his brother, and four days after Sergey went missing, Vladimir got a phone call from the family of Sergey's wife in Kyiv, who had seen the message. ""By the end of the day, they called to tell me that my brother had made his way to them,"" Vladimir said. 
Sergey was traced via the group
Sergey had made it to another shelter, but with no food and water, he and the people he was with decided to surrender to Russian troops. ""They took a white flag and went out to the Russians. After a search, they were released. Then with the help of volunteers, he drove to Kyiv,"" Vladimir says.
The rest of Sergey's family eventually made it out of Bucha and to safety in Gdansk, Poland. ""I experienced feelings that I have never experienced in my life,"" Vladimir says. ""It was such welcome news in these difficult days."" Sergey has since returned to Ukraine to join the army, he says.
Search for the Missing was started by Katya Osadcha, a former model, journalist and popular reality TV presenter. She was desperate to help when the war started, but felt she ""couldn't shoot or be a soldier"" because she has two small children. 
Instead, she asked friends on Instagram to help and now she and 15 volunteers run the group 24 hours a day, checking each message for details, and filtering out duplicates.
'Overwhelmed'
Katya says they have helped about 300 people find missing relatives, each one a happy update - a flurry of red hearts, praying and crying emojis - among the channel's endless stream of desperate pleas for information.
""You receive pictures of happy people on holidays, and their friends and family are writing to us saying that they are missing and the last call was five days ago from a shelter, and there has been a lot of bombing.""
Emma Shymanovych, who helps run the channel, says the small team of volunteers has been overwhelmed: ""It's extremely painful to read enquiries about lost children, or about children looking for their parents. It's hard to express what we feel.""
When Yulia (left) escaped Mariupol the rest of her family stayed behind
Yulia, 25, left her mother, brother and sister behind when she escaped the city of Mariupol with her husband and two-month-old baby: ""The last time I spoke to them, they had not had electricity, water, heating and communications for several days.""
When she couldn't get through to them, Yulia contacted local authorities and friends who might still be in the city to see if they knew anything, but got nowhere, and posted on the Telegram channel.
""I push the worst thoughts away from me,"" she said. ""I really hope they're safe and they just don't have a connection. I only hope for an immediate ceasefire."" Not long after we spoke, Yulia sent me a message to tell me her mother had finally been able to make contact, but was still in Mariupol. ""She spoke for just a minute. Thank God!"" 
Missing daughter
Iryna posted a picture of her friend's 23-year-old daughter Julia, after she went missing in Kyiv. ""Her mother was crying constantly,"" she says. She tried asking for news on Facebook and other Telegram channels, eventually turning to Search for the Missing.
Julia had dropped her phone when she was running to a bomb shelter
""Within 24 hours I started getting responses from people who knew her. Some said they didn't know anything, but then her friends got in touch and said Julia had broken her phone and hadn't been able to make contact.""
Julia had dropped her phone when she was running to a bomb shelter and she didn't know her mother's phone number off by heart. 
Thousands more are still trapped in Mariupol. Olga, who lives in Istanbul, posted in the channel after losing contact with her 31-year-old daughter Daria and her two grandchildren Mark, 4, and Lydia, 5, who live there.

Olga last heard from her daughter on 28 February. In a text message, Daria wrote that a shell had hit their apartment building, and there was no electricity or heating. ""I don't know what to do at all"" the message said. ""I'm scared. The children are dressed, there are a lot of blankets. Mariupol is encircled by the enemy. We have a very bad connection.""
Olga has almost given up hope of hearing from them. Monday was her daughter's birthday. ""I'm terrified of everything and I never thought that my family would be affected by war"" she says. 
Waiting to hear
Olga, from Bakhmut, posted in the group to try to find news of her daughter, Alice, and eight-month-old grandson, Timofey, in Mariupol. The last she heard from them, they were sheltering with neighbours in the basement of a supermarket without electricity, water or heating.
Alice and Timofey were last heard of sheltering in a supermarket basement
Since then, she has received a message that the building they were hiding in was bombed, and she is anxiously waiting for more news. ""Whether they are alive and where they are now - I don't know.""

499,499,Ukraine: Nick Robinson on how Germany is reversing decades of closer ties with Russia,"Tue, 15 Mar 2022 10:51:50 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-60743342,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-60743342?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,"Children of the 1989 generation won't enjoy the same freedoms as their parents, writes Nick Robinson in Berlin.","Ukraine: Nick Robinson on how Germany is reversing decades of closer ties with Russia
""Walls are not everlasting"" read graffiti on the Berlin Wall in 1989
Just over three decades ago I stood on top of the Berlin Wall which - for almost three decades before - had torn friends and families apart, split a country and set the division of Europe in concrete.  
I watched and held my breath with thousands of others on that heady night in November 1989, when one brave young man dared to jump off the wall into what had been ""no man's land"". 
Days earlier he would have been shot, joining all those who had paid with their lives for daring to try to bridge the gap between East and West. Not on the night the wall fell. He held out a flower to a bewildered-looking East German soldier who, after a pause that seemed to last a lifetime, held out his hand and accepted the gesture of peace. The crowd lining the wall cheered wildly.  
They - we - dreamt that Europe might now be ""free and whole"". People might soon be free to choose who governed them - whether they lived in Berlin or Prague, Warsaw or Budapest and perhaps, just perhaps, in Moscow and St Petersburg too.  
I am back in Berlin - a city facing up to the fact that that dream is now dead thanks to Vladimir Putin's decision to invade Ukraine and to bomb its people into submission. 
Germany's leader, Chancellor Olaf Scholz, spoke of this being a historic turning point. In German they have a word for it (they have a word for everything). It is zeitenwende. 
Mr Scholz announced his country would now offer real military aid to Ukraine.
A few weeks before, his government had been mocked for its offer of 5,000 helmets to equip the Ukrainian army. The head of the German navy had to resign after he observed that all Mr Putin wanted was respect and that he probably deserved it.   
German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, 9 March
The German chancellor has now pledged to spend more - €100bn (£84bn) more - on defence. What that means is that this country will soon become the biggest military power in Europe and the third biggest in the world - behind only China and the United States. 
Not so very long ago, that prospect would have been greeted with fear abroad and protests at home.  
As a young man - a member of what he calls ""the 1989 generation"" - Nils Schmid studied in Ukraine in what was then part of the Soviet Union. These days, he is a German MP and foreign affairs spokesman for the governing Social Democrats. He told me he and his fellow countrymen and women now had to accept that the ""iron curtain"" which divided Europe had simply moved. 
Once it had stood a few hundred yards from his office. Now, long after the fall of the wall, it is on the border between Nato countries - whose defence is guaranteed by the US - and those who look to Moscow. 
Opposite his office stands the vast Russia embassy - in what used to be East Berlin. It is now protected by police and there are barricades decorated with anti-war posters. A blanket lies on the ground and is filled with soft toys. The message to passers by is that it could be your children dying in Ukraine.  
A ""Freedom Square"" sign in Ukraine's national colours in front of the Russian embassy in Berlin, 13 March
There, I met Michael - a biker from the Black Forest in south-west Germany. He was recording a video next to his Yamaha, which he had re-painted in the blue and yellow colours of the Ukrainian flag. He had ridden for eight hours carrying a folder bulging with 600 messages to Vladimir Putin - from friends, neighbours and colleagues calling on the Russian president to stop the war. 
The embassy staff had refused to accept it. Michael had come to realise that talking to Russia (what used to be called detente) was not enough. Germany now had to be prepared to confront Moscow.  
What that means is the children of that 1989 generation will not enjoy the same freedoms as their parents. They will not grow up believing that wars are what happened in the past. Indeed a recent poll showed that seven in 10 Germans fear the spread of this war. 
People from Ukraine queuing for mobile phone cards in Berlin, 14 March
And no wonder. The refugees driven from their homes by this conflict are pouring off trains into Berlin's stations at a rate of, some say, 10,000 a day.  
This war is re-shaping how Europe's most powerful country thinks. That will have dramatic consequences which are only just beginning to be thought through.  
You have to be almost 40 years old to remember the day when the wall fell back in November 1989. These days of February and March 2022 are turning out to be just as consequential.
